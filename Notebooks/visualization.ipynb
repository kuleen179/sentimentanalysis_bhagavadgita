It is the dead of winter and a fierce snowstorm rages outside,\\nbut a great fire fills the space within the hall with warmth and light. Now\\nand then, a sparrow darts in for refuge from the weather. It appears as if\\nfrom nowhere, flits about joyfully in the light, and then disappears again,\\nand where it comes from and where it goes next in that stormy darkness, we\\ndo not know.\\nOur lives are like that, suggests an old story in Bede’s medieval history\\nof England. We spend our days in the familiar world of our five senses, but\\nwhat lies beyond that, if anything, we have no idea. Those sparrows are\\nhints of something more outside – a vast world, perhaps, waiting to be\\nexplored. But most of us are happy to stay where we are. We may even be a\\nbit afraid to venture into the unknown. What would be the point, we ask.\\nWhy should we leave the world we know?\\nYet there are always a few who are not content to spend their lives\\nindoors. Simply knowing there is something unknown beyond their reach\\nmakes them acutely restless. They have to see what lies outside – if only, as\\nGeorge Mallory said of Everest, “because it’s there.”\\nThis is true of adventurers of every kind, but especially of those who\\nseek to explore not mountains or jungles but consciousness itself: whose\\nreal drive, we might say, is not so much to know the unknown as to know\\nthe knower. Such men and women can be found in every age and every\\nculture. While the rest of us stay put, they quietly slip out to see what lies\\nbeyond.\\nThen, so far as we can tell, they disappear. We have no idea where they\\nhave gone; we can’t even imagine. But every now and then, like friends\\nwho have run off to some exotic land, they send back reports: breathless\\nmessages describing fantastic adventures, rambling letters about a world\\nbeyond ordinary experience, urgent telegrams begging us to come and see.\\n\\n\\x0c“Look at this view! Isn’t it breathtaking? Wish you could see this. Wish you\\nwere here.”\\nThe works in this set of translations – the Upanishads, the Bhagavad\\nGita, and the Dhammapada – are among the earliest and most universal of\\nmessages like these, sent to inform us that there is more to life than the\\neveryday experience of our senses. The Upanishads are the oldest, so varied\\nthat we feel some unknown collectors must have tossed into a jumble all the\\nphotos, postcards, and letters from this world that they could find, without\\nany regard for source or circumstance. Thrown together like this, they form\\na kind of ecstatic slide show – snapshots of towering peaks of\\nconsciousness taken at various times by different observers and dispatched\\nwith just the barest kind of explanation. But those who have traveled those\\nheights will recognize the views: “Oh, yes, that’s Everest from the\\nnorthwest – must be late spring. And here we’re south, in the full snows of\\nwinter.”\\nThe Dhammapada, too, is a collection – traditionally, sayings of the\\nBuddha, one of the very greatest of these explorers of consciousness. In this\\ncase the messages have been sorted, but not by a scheme that makes sense\\nto us today. Instead of being grouped by theme or topic, they are gathered\\naccording to some dominant characteristic like a symbol or metaphor –\\nflowers, birds, a river, the sky – that makes them easy to commit to\\nmemory. If the Upanishads are like slides, the Dhammapada seems more\\nlike a field guide. This is lore picked up by someone who knows every step\\nof the way through these strange lands. He can’t take us there, he explains,\\nbut he can show us the way: tell us what to look for, warn about missteps,\\nadvise us about detours, tell us what to avoid. Most important, he urges us\\nthat it is our destiny as human beings to make this journey ourselves.\\nEverything else is secondary.\\nAnd the third of these classics, the Bhagavad Gita, gives us a map and\\nguidebook. It gives a systematic overview of the territory, shows various\\napproaches to the summit with their benefits and pitfalls, offers\\nrecommendations, tells us what to pack and what to leave behind. More\\nthan either of the others, it gives the sense of a personal guide. It asks and\\nanswers the questions that you or I might ask – questions not about\\nphilosophy or mysticism, but about how to live effectively in a world of\\nchallenge and change. Of these three, it is the Gita that has been my own\\npersonal guidebook, just as it was Mahatma Gandhi’s.\\n\\n\\x0cThese three texts are very personal records of a landscape that is both real\\nand universal. Their voices, passionately human, speak directly to you and\\nme. They describe the topography of consciousness itself, which belongs as\\nmuch to us today as to these largely anonymous seers thousands of years\\nago. If the landscape seems dark in the light of sense perception, they tell\\nus, it has an illumination of its own, and once our eyes adjust we can see in\\nwhat Western mystics call this “divine dark” and verify their descriptions\\nfor ourselves.\\nAnd this world, they insist, is where we belong. This wider field of\\nconsciousness is our native land. We are not cabin-dwellers, born to a life\\ncramped and confined; we are meant to explore, to seek, to push the limits\\nof our potential as human beings. The world of the senses is just a base\\ncamp: we are meant to be as much at home in consciousness as in the world\\nof physical reality.\\nThis is a message that thrills men and women in every age and culture. It\\nis for such kindred spirits that these texts were originally composed, and it\\nis for them in our own time that I undertook these translations, in the\\nconviction that they deserve an audience today as much as ever. If these\\nbooks speak to even a handful of such readers, they will have served their\\npurpose.\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nThe Bhagavad Gita\\nMany years ago, when I was still a graduate student, I traveled by train\\nfrom central India to Simla, then the summer seat of the British government\\nin India. We had not been long out of Delhi when suddenly a chattering of\\nvoices disturbed my reverie. I asked the man next to me if something had\\nhappened. “Kurukshetra!” he replied. “The next stop is Kurukshetra!”\\nI could understand the excitement. Kurukshetra, “the field of the Kurus,”\\nis the setting for the climactic battle of the Mahabharata, the vastest epic in\\nany world literature, on which virtually every Hindu child in India is raised.\\nIts characters, removed in time by some three thousand years, are as\\nfamiliar to us as our relatives. The temper of the story is utterly\\ncontemporary; I can imagine it unfolding in the nuclear age as easily as in\\nthe dawn of Indian history. The Mahabharata is literature at its greatest – in\\nfact, it has been called a literature in itself, comparable in its breadth and\\ndepth and characterization to the whole of Greek literature or Shakespeare.\\nBut what makes it unique is that embedded in this literary masterpiece is\\none of the finest mystical documents the world has seen: the Bhagavad\\nGita.\\nI must have heard the Gita recited thousands of times when I was\\ngrowing up, but I don’t suppose it had any special significance for me then.\\nNot until I went to college and met Mahatma Gandhi did I begin to\\nunderstand why nothing in the long, rich stretch of Indian culture has had a\\nwider appeal, not only within India but outside as well. Today, after more\\nthan thirty years of devoted study, I would not hesitate to call it India’s most\\nimportant gift to the world. The Gita has been translated into every major\\nlanguage and perhaps a hundred times into English alone; commentaries on\\nit are said to be more numerous than on any other scripture. Like the\\nSermon on the Mount, it has an immediacy that sweeps away time, place,\\nand circumstance. Addressed to everyone, of whatever background or\\nstatus, the Gita distills the loftiest truths of India’s ancient wisdom into\\nsimple, memorable poetry that haunts the mind and informs the affairs of\\neveryday life.\\n\\n\\x0cEveryone in our car got down from the train to wander for a few minutes\\non the now peaceful field. Thousands of years ago this was Armageddon.\\nThe air rang with the conch-horns and shouts of battle for eighteen days.\\nGreat phalanxes shaped like eagles and fish and the crescent moon surged\\nback and forth in search of victory, until in the end almost every warrior in\\nthe land lay slain.\\n“Imagine!” my companion said to me in awe. “Bhishma and Drona\\ncommanded their armies here. Arjuna rode here, with Sri Krishna himself\\nas his charioteer. Where you’re standing now – who knows? – Arjuna might\\nhave sat, his bow and arrows on the ground, while Krishna gave him the\\nwords of the Bhagavad Gita.”\\nThe thought was thrilling. I felt the way Schliemann must have when he\\nfinally reached that desolate bluff of western Turkey and knew he was\\nstanding “on the ringing plains of windy Troy,” walking the same ground as\\nAchilles, Odysseus, Hector, and Helen. Yet at the same time, I felt I knew\\nthe setting of the Gita much more intimately than I could ever know this\\npeaceful field. The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gita’s subject is\\nthe war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must\\nwage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious.\\nTHE GITA AND ITS SETTING\\n\\nHistorians surmise that like the Iliad, the Mahabharata might well be based\\non actual events, culminating in a war that took place somewhere around\\n1000 B.C. – close, that is, to the very dawn of recorded Indian history. This\\nguess has recently been supported by excavations at the ancient city of\\nDvaraka, which, according to the Mahabharata, was destroyed and\\nsubmerged in the sea after the departure of its divine ruler, Krishna. Only\\nfive hundred years or so before this, by generally accepted guess, Aryan\\ntribes originally from the area between the Caspian Sea and the Hindu Kush\\nmountains had migrated into the Indian subcontinent, bringing the\\nprototype of the Sanskrit language and countless elements of belief and\\nculture that have been part of the Hindu tradition ever since. The oldest part\\nof the most ancient of Hindu scriptures, the Rig Veda, dates from this period\\n– about 1500 B.C., if not earlier.\\nYet the wellspring of Indian religious faith, I believe, can be traced to a\\nmuch earlier epoch. When the Aryans entered the Indian subcontinent\\nthrough the mountains of the Hindu Kush, they encountered a civilization\\n\\n\\x0con the banks of the Indus river that archeologists date back as far as 3000\\nB.C. Roughly contemporaneous with the pyramid-builders on the Nile,\\nthese Indus-dwellers achieved a comparable level of technology. They had\\nmetalworkers skilled in sheet-making, riveting, and casting of copper and\\nbronze, crafts and industries with standardized methods of production, land\\nand sea trade with cultures as far away as Mesopotamia, and well-planned\\ncities with water supply and public sanitation systems unequaled until the\\nRomans. Evidence suggests that they may have used a decimal system of\\nmeasurement. But most remarkable, images of Shiva as Yogeshvara, the\\nLord of Yoga, suggest that meditation was practiced in a civilization which\\nflourished a millennium before the Vedas were committed to an oral\\ntradition.\\nIf this is so, it would imply that the same systematic attitude the Indus\\nValley dwellers applied to their technology was applied also to study of the\\nmind. This was brahmavidya, the “supreme science” – supreme because\\nwhere other sciences studied the external world, brahmavidya sought\\nknowledge of an underlying reality which would inform all other studies\\nand activities.\\nWhatever its origins, in the early part of the first millennium B.C. we\\nfind clearly stated both the methods and the discoveries of brahmavidya.\\nWith this introspective tool the inspired rishis (literally “seers”) of ancient\\nIndia analyzed their awareness of human experience to see if there was\\nanything in it that was absolute. Their findings can be summarized in three\\nstatements which Aldous Huxley, following Leibnitz, has called the\\nPerennial Philosophy because they appear in every age and civilization: (1)\\nthere is an infinite, changeless reality beneath the world of change; (2) this\\nsame reality lies at the core of every human personality; (3) the purpose of\\nlife is to discover this reality experientially: that is, to realize God while\\nhere on earth. These principles and the interior experiments for realizing\\nthem were taught systematically in “forest academies” or ashrams – a\\ntradition which continues unbroken after some three thousand years.\\nThe discoveries of brahmavidya were systematically committed to\\nmemory (and eventually to writing) in the Upanishads, visionary documents\\nthat are the earliest and purest statement of the Perennial Philosophy. How\\nmany of these precious records once existed no one knows; a dozen that\\ndate from Vedic times have survived as part of the Hindu canon of\\nauthority, the four Vedas. All have one unmistakable hallmark: the vivid\\n\\n\\x0cstamp of personal mystical experience. These are records of direct\\nencounter with the divine. Tradition calls them shruti: literally “heard,” as\\nopposed to learned; they are their own authority. By convention, only the\\nVedas (including their Upanishads) are considered shruti, based on direct\\nknowledge of God.\\nAccording to this definition, all other Indian scriptures – including the\\nGita – are secondary, dependent on the higher authority of the Vedas.\\nHowever, this is a conventional distinction and one that might disguise the\\nnature of the documents it classifies. In the literal sense the Gita too is\\nshruti, owing its authority not to other scriptures but to the fact that it set\\ndown the direct mystical experience of a single author. Shankara, a\\ntowering mystic of the ninth century A.D. whose word carries the authority\\nof Augustine, Eckhart, and Aquinas all in one, must have felt this, for in\\nselecting the minimum sources of Hinduism he passed over almost a\\nhundred Upanishads of Vedic authority to choose ten central Upanishads\\nand the Bhagavad Gita.\\nThe Gita, I would argue, is not an integral part of the Mahabharata. It is\\nessentially an Upanishad, and my conjecture is that it was set down by an\\ninspired seer (traditionally Vyasa) and inserted into the epic at the\\nappropriate place. Other elements were added in this way to the\\nMahabharata, and to other popular secondary scriptures; it is an effective\\nway of preserving new material in an oral tradition. There is also traditional\\nweight behind this idea, for as far back as anyone can trace, each chapter of\\nthe Gita has ended with the same formula: “In the Bhagavad-Gita\\nUpanishad, the text on the supreme science [brahmavidya] of yoga, this is\\nthe chapter entitled . . .”\\nFinally, by way of further support, we can observe that except for its first\\nchapter, which sets the stage, the Gita not only does not develop the action\\nof the Mahabharata but is rather at odds with it. Battle lines are drawn – the\\nclimax of decades of dissension – and on the eve of combat, Prince Arjuna\\nloses his nerve and asks his charioteer, Krishna, what to do. Then what?\\nKrishna – no ordinary charioteer, but an incarnation of God – enters into\\nsome seven hundred verses of sublime instruction on the nature of the soul\\nand its relation to God, the levels of consciousness and reality, the makeup\\nof the phenomenal world, and so on, culminating in a stupendous mystical\\nexperience in which he reveals himself to Arjuna as the transcendent Lord\\nof life and death. He counsels Arjuna to be compassionate to friend and\\n\\n\\x0cenemy alike, to see himself in every person, to suffer others’ sorrows as his\\nown. Then the Gita is over, the narration picks up again, and battle is joined\\n– a terrible, desperate slaughter compromising everyone’s honor, by the end\\nof which Arjuna’s side emerges victorious. But almost every man of\\nfighting age on both sides has been slain. Only great genius would have\\nplaced the Gita in such a dramatic setting, but it stands out from the rest as a\\ntimeless, practical manual for daily living.\\nTo those who take this dramatic setting as part of the spiritual instruction\\nand get entangled in the question of the Gita justifying war, Gandhi had a\\npractical answer: just base your life on the Gita sincerely and systematically\\nand see if you find killing or even hurting others compatible with its\\nteachings. (He makes the same point of the Sermon on the Mount.) The\\nvery heart of the Gita’s message is to see the Lord in every creature and act\\naccordingly, and the scripture is full of verses to spell out what this means:\\nI am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature.\\nSeeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me.\\nThey worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from\\nme. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. (6:30–31)\\nWhen a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they\\nwere his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. (6:32)\\nThat one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and\\ncompassionate. (12:13)\\nThey alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who\\nsee the deathless in the hearts of all that die. Seeing the same Lord\\neverywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the\\nsupreme goal. (13:27–28)\\nScholars can debate the point forever, but when the Gita is practiced, I\\nthink, it becomes clear that the struggle the Gita is concerned with is the\\nstruggle for self-mastery. It was Vyasa’s genius to take the whole great\\nMahabharata epic and see it as metaphor for the perennial war between the\\nforces of light and the forces of darkness in every human heart. Arjuna and\\nKrishna are then no longer merely characters in a literary masterpiece.\\nArjuna becomes Everyman, asking the Lord himself, Sri Krishna, the\\n\\n\\x0cperennial questions about life and death – not as a philosopher, but as the\\nquintessential man of action. Thus read, the Gita is not an external dialogue\\nbut an internal one: between the ordinary human personality, full of\\nquestions about the meaning of life, and our deepest Self, which is divine.\\nThere is, in fact, no other way to read the Gita and grasp it as spiritual\\ninstruction. If I could offer only one key to understanding this divine\\ndialogue, it would be to remember that it takes place in the depths of\\nconsciousness and that Krishna is not some external being, human or\\nsuperhuman, but the spark of divinity that lies at the core of the human\\npersonality. This is not literary or philosophical conjecture; Krishna says as\\nmuch to Arjuna over and over: “I am the Self in the heart of every creature,\\nArjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence” (10:20).\\nIn such statements the Gita distills the essence of the Upanishads, not\\npiecemeal but comprehensively, offering their lofty insights as a manual not\\nof philosophy but of everyday human activity – a handbook of the Perennial\\nPhilosophy unique in world history.\\nTHE UPANISHADIC BACKGROUND\\n\\nThe Gita, naturally enough, takes for granted that its audience is familiar\\nwith the basic ideas of Hindu religious thought, almost all of which can be\\nfound in the Upanishads. It also uses some technical vocabulary from yoga\\npsychology. All this needs to be explained in contemporary terms if the\\nmodern reader is to grasp what is essential and timeless in the Gita’s\\nmessage and not get bogged down in strange terminology.\\nFirst, however, the non-Hindu faces a third obstacle: the multiplicity of\\nnames used for aspects of God. From the earliest times, Hinduism has\\nproclaimed one God while accommodating worship of him (or her, for to\\nmillions God is the Divine Mother) in many different names. “Truth is\\none,” says a famous verse of the Rig Veda; “people call it by various\\nnames.” Monastic devotees might find that Shiva embodies the austere\\ndetachment they seek; devotees who want to live “in the world,” partaking\\nof its innocent pleasures but devoted to service of their fellow creatures,\\nmight find in Krishna the perfect incarnation of their ideals. In every case,\\nthis clothing of the Infinite in human form serves to focus a devotee’s love\\nand to provide an inspiring ideal. But whatever form is worshipped, it is\\nonly an aspect of the same one God.\\n\\n\\x0cIn the Gita – in fact, virtually everywhere in Hindu myth and scripture –\\nwe also encounter “the gods” in the plural. These are the devas, deities\\nwhich seem to have come in with the Aryans and which have recognizable\\ncounterparts in other Aryan-influenced cultures: Indra, god of war and\\nstorm; Varuna, god of waters and a moral overseer; Agni, god of fire, the\\nHermes-like intermediary between heaven and earth; and so on. The Gita\\nrefers to the devas as being worshipped by those who want to propitiate\\nnatural and supernatural powers, in much the same way that ancestors were\\nworshipped. In modern terms, they can best be understood as personifying\\nthe forces of nature.\\nThis question out of the way, we can proceed to the Upanishadic\\nbackground the Gita assumes.\\nAtman and Brahman\\n\\nThe Upanishads are not systematic philosophy; they are more like ecstatic\\nslide shows of mystical experience – vivid, disjointed, stamped with the\\npower of direct personal encounter with the divine. If they seem to embrace\\ncontradictions, that is because they do not try to smooth over the seams of\\nthese experiences. They simply set down what the rishis saw, viewing the\\nultimate reality from different levels of spiritual awareness, like snapshots\\nof the same object from different angles: now seeing God as utterly\\ntranscendent, for example, now seeing God as immanent as well. These\\ndifferences are not important, and the Upanishads agree on their central\\nideas: Brahman, the Godhead; Atman, the divine core of personality;\\ndharma, the law that expresses and maintains the unity of creation; karma,\\nthe web of cause and effect; samsara, the cycle of birth and death; moksha,\\nthe spiritual liberation that is life’s supreme goal.\\nEven while ancient India was making breakthroughs in the natural\\nsciences and mathematics, the sages of the Upanishads were turning inward\\nto analyze the data that nature presents to the mind. Penetrating below the\\nsenses, they found not a world of solid, separate objects but a ceaseless\\nprocess of change – matter coming together, dissolving, and coming\\ntogether again in a different form. Below this flux of things with “name and\\nform,” however, they found something changeless: an infinite, indivisible\\nreality in which the transient data of the world cohere. They called this\\nreality Brahman: the Godhead, the divine ground of existence.\\n\\n\\x0cThis analysis of the phenomenal world tallies well enough with\\ncontemporary physics. A physicist would remind us that the things we see\\n“out there” are not ultimately separate from each other and from us; we\\nperceive them as separate because of the limitations of our senses. If our\\neyes were sensitive to a much finer spectrum, we might see the world as a\\ncontinuous field of matter and energy. Nothing in this picture resembles a\\nsolid object in our usual sense of the word. “The external world of physics,”\\nwrote Sir Arthur Eddington, “has thus become a world of shadows. In\\nremoving our illusions we remove the substance, for indeed we have seen\\nthat substance is one of the greatest of our illusions.” Like the physicists,\\nthese ancient sages were seeking an invariant. They found it in Brahman.\\nIn examining our knowledge of ourselves, the sages made a similar\\ndiscovery. Instead of a single coherent personality, they found layer on layer\\nof components – senses, emotions, will, intellect, ego – each in flux. At\\ndifferent times and in different company, the same person seems to have\\ndifferent personalities. Moods shift and flicker, even in those who are\\nemotionally stable; desires and opinions change with time. Change is the\\nnature of the mind. The sages observed this flow of thoughts and sensations\\nand asked, “Then where am I?” The parts do not add up to a whole; they\\njust flow by. Like physical phenomena, the mind is a field of forces, no\\nmore the seat of intelligence than radiation or gravity is. Just as the world\\ndissolves into a sea of energy, the mind dissolves into a river of impressions\\nand thoughts, a flow of fragmentary data that do not hold together.\\nWestern philosophers have reasoned their way to a similar conclusion,\\nbut with them it was an intellectual exercise. David Hume confesses that\\nwhenever he was forced to conclude that his empirical ego was\\ninsubstantial, he went out for a walk, had a good dinner, and forgot all about\\nit. For these ancient sages, however, these were not logical conclusions but\\npersonal discoveries. They were actually exploring the mind, testing each\\nlevel of awareness by withdrawing consciousness to the level below. In\\nprofound meditation, they found, when consciousness is so acutely focused\\nthat it is utterly withdrawn from the body and mind, it enters a kind of\\nsingularity in which the sense of a separate ego disappears. In this state, the\\nsupreme climax of meditation, the seers discovered a core of consciousness\\nbeyond time and change. They called it simply Atman, the Self.\\nI have described the discovery of Atman and Brahman – God immanent\\nand God transcendent – as separate, but there is no real distinction. In the\\n\\n\\x0cclimax of meditation, the sages discovered unity: the same indivisible\\nreality without and within. It was advaita, “not two.” The Chandogya\\nUpanishad says epigrammatically, Tat tvam asi: “Thou art That.” Atman is\\nBrahman: the Self in each person is not different from the Godhead.\\nNor is it different from person to person. The Self is one, the same in\\nevery creature. This is not some peculiar tenet of the Hindu scriptures; it is\\nthe testimony of everyone who has undergone these experiments in the\\ndepths of consciousness and followed them through to the end. Here is\\nRuysbroeck, a great mystic of medieval Europe; every word is most\\ncarefully chosen:\\nThe image of God is found essentially and personally in all mankind.\\nEach possesses it whole, entire and undivided, and all together not more\\nthan one alone. In this way we are all one, intimately united in our\\neternal image, which is the image of God and the source in us of all our\\nlife.\\nMaya\\n\\nIn the unitive experience, every trace of separateness disappears; life is a\\nseamless whole. But the body cannot remain in this state for long. After a\\nwhile, awareness of mind and body returns, and then the conventional\\nworld of multiplicity rushes in again with such vigor and vividness that the\\nmemory of unity, though stamped with reality, seems as distant as a dream.\\nThe unitive state has to be entered over and over until a person is\\nestablished in it. But once established, even in the midst of ordinary life,\\none sees the One underlying the many, the Eternal beneath the ephemeral.\\nWhat is it that makes undivided reality appear to be a world of separate,\\ntransient objects? What makes each of us believe that we are the body\\nrather than our own Self? The sages answered with a story still told after\\nthousands of years. Imagine, they said, a man dreaming that he is being\\nattacked by a tiger. His pulse will race, his fists will clench, his forehead\\nwill be wet with the dew of fear – all just as if the attack were real. He will\\nbe able to describe the look of his tiger, the way he smelled, the sound of\\nhis roar. For him the tiger is real, and in a sense he is not wrong: the\\nevidence he has is not qualitatively different from the kind of evidence we\\ntrust when we are awake. People have even died from the physiological\\neffects of a potent dream. Only when we wake up can we realize that our\\n\\n\\x0cdream-sensations, though real to our nervous system, are a lower level of\\nreality than the waking state.\\nThe Upanishads delineate three ordinary states of consciousness: waking,\\ndreaming, and dreamless sleep. Each is real, but each has a higher order of\\nreality. For beyond these three, the Upanishads say, is the unitive state,\\ncalled simply “the fourth”: turiya. Entering this state is similar to waking up\\nout of dream sleep: the individual passes from a lower level of reality to a\\nhigher one.\\nThe sages called the dream of waking life – the dream of separate,\\nmerely physical existence – by a suggestive name, maya. In general use the\\nword meant a kind of magic, the power of a god or sorcerer to make a thing\\nappear to be something else. In the Gita, maya becomes the creative power\\nof the Godhead, the primal creative energy that makes unity appear as the\\nworld of innumerable separate things with “name and form.”\\nLater philosophers explained maya in surprisingly contemporary terms.\\nThe mind, they said, observes the so-called outside world and sees its own\\nstructure. It reports that the world consists of a multiplicity of separate\\nobjects in a framework of time, space, and causality because these are the\\nconditions of perception. In a word, the mind looks at unity and sees\\ndiversity; it looks at what is timeless and reports transience. And in fact the\\npercepts of its experience are diverse and transient; on this level of\\nexperience, separateness is real. Our mistake is in taking this for ultimate\\nreality, like the dreamer thinking that nothing is real except his dream.\\nNowhere has this “mysterious Eastern notion” been formulated more\\nsuccinctly than in the epigram of Ruysbroeck: “We behold what we are, and\\nwe are what we behold.” When we look at unity through the instruments of\\nthe mind, we see diversity; when the mind is transcended, we enter a higher\\nmode of knowing – turiya, the fourth state of consciousness – in which\\nduality disappears. This does not mean, however, that the phenomenal\\nworld is an illusion or unreal. The illusion is the sense of separateness.\\nHere again we can illustrate from physics: the world of “name and form”\\nexists only as a condition of perception; at the subatomic level, separate\\nphenomena dissolve into a flux of energy. The effect of maya is similar. The\\nworld of the senses is real, but it must be known for what it is: unity\\nappearing as multiplicity.\\nThose who disidentify themselves with the conditions of perception in\\nmaya wake up into a higher mode of knowing in which the unity of life is\\n\\n\\x0capprehended directly. The disciplines for achieving this are called yoga, as\\nis the state of union: the word comes from the root yuj, to yoke or bind\\ntogether. The “experience” itself (properly speaking, it is beyond\\nexperience) is called samadhi. And the state attained is moksha or nirvana,\\nboth of which signify going beyond the conditioning of maya – time, space,\\nand causality.\\nIn this state we realize that we are not a physical creature but the Atman,\\nthe Self, and thus not separate from God. We see the world not as pieces but\\nwhole, and we see that whole as a manifestation of God. Once identified\\nwith the Self, we know that although the body will die, we will not die; our\\nawareness of this identity is not ruptured by the death of the physical body.\\nThus we have realized the essential immortality which is the birthright of\\nevery human being. To such a person, the Gita says, death is no more\\ntraumatic than taking off an old coat (2:22).\\nLife cannot offer any higher realization. The supreme goal of human\\nexistence has been attained. The man or woman who realizes God has\\neverything and lacks nothing: having this, “they desire nothing else, and\\ncannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow” (6:22). Life cannot\\nthreaten such a person; all it holds is the opportunity to love, to serve, and\\nto give.\\nDharma, Karma, Rebirth, and Liberation\\n\\nIt has been said that if you understand just two words, dharma and karma,\\nyou will have grasped the essence of Hinduism. This is a simplification, but\\nit would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of these concepts. Both\\nare deeply embedded in Hindu thought, and the Gita, like other Hindu\\nscriptures, takes them for granted, not as theoretical premises but as facts of\\nlife that can be verified in personal experience.\\nThe word dharma means many things, but its underlying sense is “that\\nwhich supports,” from the root dhri, to support, hold up, or bear. Generally,\\ndharma implies support from within: the essence of a thing, its virtue, that\\nwhich makes it what it is.\\nAn old story illumines this meaning with the highest ideal of Hinduism.\\nA sage, seated beside the Ganges, notices a scorpion that has fallen into the\\nwater. He reaches down and rescues it, only to be stung. Some time later he\\nlooks down and sees the scorpion thrashing about in the water again. Once\\nmore he reaches down to rescue it, and once more he is stung. A bystander,\\n\\n\\x0cobserving all this, exclaims, “Holy one, why do you keep doing that? Don’t\\nyou see that the wretched creature will only sting you in return?” “Of\\ncourse,” the sage replied. “It is the dharma of a scorpion to sting. But it is\\nthe dharma of a human being to save.”\\nOn a larger scale, dharma means the essential order of things, an integrity\\nand harmony in the universe and the affairs of life that cannot be disturbed\\nwithout courting chaos. Thus it means rightness, justice, goodness, purpose\\nrather than chance.\\nUnderlying this idea is the oneness of life: the Upanishadic discovery that\\nall things are interconnected because at its deepest level creation is\\nindivisible. This oneness bestows a basic balance on the whole of nature\\nsuch that any disturbance in one place has to send ripples everywhere, as a\\nperfect bubble, touched lightly in one place, trembles all over until balance\\nis restored. The implications are caught perfectly by those famous lines\\nfrom John Donne, which deserve to be read now with a fresh eye as not\\nmerely great rhetoric but a faithful representation of reality:\\nNo man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the\\ncontinent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea,\\nEurope is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor\\nof thy friends or of thine own were; any man’s death diminishes me,\\nbecause I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know\\nfor whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.\\nThere is an ancient Sanskrit epigram, Ahimsa paramo dharma: the\\nhighest dharma is ahimsa, nonviolence, universal love for all living\\ncreatures; for every kind of violence is a violation of dharma, the\\nfundamental law of the unity of life.\\nThus every act or thought has consequences, which themselves will have\\nconsequences; life is the most intricate web of interconnections. This is the\\nlaw of karma, one of the most important and least understood ideas in\\nancient Indian thought. Karma is repeated so often in the Gita that I want to\\nillustrate it in some detail: some intuitive sense of karma as an organic law\\nmakes Krishna’s teachings a good deal clearer.\\nLiterally, the Sanskrit karma means something that is done. Often it can\\nbe translated as deed or action. The law of karma states simply that every\\nevent is both a cause and an effect. Every act has consequences of a similar\\n\\n\\x0ckind, which in turn have further consequences and so on; and every act,\\nevery karma, is also the consequence of some previous karma.\\nThis refers not only to physical action but to mental activity as well. In\\ntheir analysis of the phenomenal world and the world within, the sages of\\nthe Upanishads found that there is not merely an accidental but an essential\\nrelationship between mental and physical activity. Given appropriate\\nconditions to develop further, thoughts breed actions of the same kind, as a\\nseed can grow only into one particular kind of tree.\\nBaldly put, the law of karma says that whatever you do will come back to\\nyou. No one, of course, has the omniscience to see the picture fully. But the\\nidea of a network of connections, far from being occult, is natural and\\nplausible. The law of karma states unequivocally that though we cannot see\\nthe connections, we can be sure that everything that happens to us, good\\nand bad, originated once in something we did or thought. We ourselves are\\nresponsible for what happens to us, whether or not we can understand how.\\nIt follows that we can change what happens to us by changing ourselves; we\\ncan take our destiny into our own hands.\\nThe physical side of karma, however, only touches the surface of life. To\\nget an inkling of how karma really works, we have to consider the mind.\\nEverything we do produces karma in the mind. In fact, it is in the mind\\nrather than the world that karma’s seeds are planted. Aptly, Indian\\nphilosophy compares a thought to a seed: very tiny, but it can grow into a\\nhuge, deep-rooted, wide-spreading tree. I have seen places where a seed in a\\ncrack of a pavement grew into a tree that tore up the sidewalk. It is difficult\\nto remove such a tree, and terribly difficult to undo the effects of a lifetime\\nof negative thinking, which can extend into many other people’s lives. But\\nit can be done, and the purpose of the Gita is to show how.\\nKarma is sometimes considered punitive, a matter of getting one’s just\\ndesserts. This is accurate enough, but it is much more illuminating to\\nconsider karma an educative force whose purpose is to teach the individual\\nto act in harmony with dharma – not to pursue selfish interests at the\\nexpense of others, but to contribute to life and consider the welfare of the\\nwhole. In this sense life is like a school; one can learn, one can graduate,\\none can skip a grade or stay behind. As long as a debt of karma remains,\\nhowever, a person has to keep coming back for further education. That is\\nthe basis of samsara, the cycle of birth and death.\\n\\n\\x0cA good many wrong and misleading words have been written on this\\nsubject, largely because of the fascination it seems to hold in the West.\\nRightly understood, however, reincarnation is not exotic but quite natural. If\\npersonality consists of several sheaths, the body being only the outermost,\\nthere is no reason why personality should die when the body is shed. The\\nsages of the Upanishads saw personality as a field of forces. Packets of\\nkarma to them are forces that have to work themselves out; if the process is\\ninterrupted by death, those forces remain until conditions allow them to\\nwork again in a new context.\\nAgain, sleep can illustrate the dynamics of this idea. In sleep a person\\npasses in and out of two stages, dreaming and dreamless sleep. In the first,\\nconsciousness is withdrawn from the body and senses but still engaged in\\nthe mind. In dreamless sleep, however, consciousness is withdrawn from\\nthe mind as well. Then the thinking process – even the sense of “I” – is\\ntemporarily suspended, and consciousness is said to rest in the Self. In this\\nstate a person ceases to be a separate creature, a separate personality. In\\ndreamless sleep, the Upanishads say, a king is not a king nor a pauper poor;\\nno one is old or young, male or female, educated or ignorant. When\\nconsciousness returns to the mind, however, the thinking process starts up\\nagain, and personality returns to the body.\\nAccording to this analysis, the ego dies every night. Every morning we\\npick up our desires where we left off: the same person, yet a little different\\ntoo. The Upanishads describe dying as a very similar process.\\nConsciousness is withdrawn from the body into the senses, from the senses\\ninto the mind, and finally consolidated in the ego; when the body is finally\\nwrenched away, the ego remains, a potent package of desires and karma.\\nAnd as our last waking thoughts shape our dreams, the contents of the\\nunconscious at the time of death – the residue of all that we have thought\\nand desired and lived for in the past – determine the context of our next life.\\nWe take a body again, the sages say, to come back to just the conditions\\nwhere our desires and karma can be fulfilled. The Self-realized person,\\nhowever, has no karma to work out, no personal desires; at the time of death\\nhe or she is absorbed into the Lord:\\nBut they for whom I am the supreme goal, who do all work renouncing\\nself for me and meditate on me with single-hearted devotion, these I\\n\\n\\x0cwill swiftly rescue from the fragment’s cycle of birth and death, for their\\nconsciousness has entered into me. (12:6–7)\\nSuch a person, the Upanishads stress, can actually shed the body\\nvoluntarily when the hour of death arrives, by withdrawing consciousness\\nstep by step in full awareness. Some of the Gita’s most fascinating verses,\\nfor those who can interpret them, are Krishna’s instructions on how to die\\n(8:12–13).\\nYOGA PSYCHOLOGY\\n\\nIn trying to describe their discoveries, the Upanishadic seers developed a\\nspecialized vocabulary. Their terms were later elaborated by mystics who\\nwere also brilliant philosophers – Kapila, Shankara, and others, the ancient\\nIndian counterparts of authorities like Augustine and Aquinas in the West.\\nThe most useful part of this vocabulary comes from Sankhya, the\\nphilosophical system whose practical counterpart is the school of\\nmeditation called Yoga. Both are traditionally traced to one towering\\nauthority, Kapila, and have much in common with Buddhist philosophy. An\\nancient saying celebrates their practicality: “There is no theory like\\nSankhya, no practice like Yoga.”\\nThe Gita does not belong to the Sankhya school or to any other; it is as\\ncomprehensive as the Upanishads. But Sankhya provides a precise\\nvocabulary for describing the workings of the mind, and the Gita draws on\\nthat vocabulary freely.\\nSankhya philosophy posits two separate categories: Purusha, spirit, and\\nprakriti, everything else. This is not the Western mind-matter distinction.\\nPrakriti is the field of what can be known objectively, the field of\\nphenomena, the world of whatever has “name and form”: that is, not only of\\nmatter and energy but also of the mind. As physics postulates a unified field\\nfrom which all phenomena can be derived, Sankhya describes a field that\\nincludes mental phenomena as well. Mind, energy, and matter all belong to\\na field of forces. Purusha, pure spirit, is the knower of this field of\\nphenomena, and belongs to a wholly different order of reality. Only Purusha\\nis conscious – or, rather, Purusha is consciousness itself. What we call\\n“mind” is only an internal instrument that Purusha uses, just as the body is\\nits external instrument. For practical purposes – at least as far as the Gita is\\n\\n\\x0cconcerned – Purusha may be regarded as a synonym for Atman. Purusha is\\nthe Self, beyond all change, the same in every creature.\\nMatter and Mind\\n\\nPerhaps I should confess at this point that the paragraphs that follow in this\\nshort section are somewhat technical and not necessary for understanding\\nthe Gita. They can be skipped by anyone who finds them dry. I include\\nthem simply because Sankhya’s explanation of mind and matter, when\\nproperly understood, makes sense of many subjects in the Gita that might\\notherwise seem arbitrary: maya, the survival of personality after death, the\\nway karma works through the mind. It accommodates modern physics\\nperfectly and offers promising explanations of mind-body relationships in\\nhealth and disease. However, Sankhya’s way of looking at the mind is very\\ndifferent from our usual physical orientation, and therefore impossible to\\nabsorb without reflection.\\nSankhya’s hallmark is a list (sankhya means counting or listing) of\\ntwenty-four principles or tattvas (“suchnesses”) which trace the steps by\\nwhich unitary, primordial prakriti becomes manifested as the countless\\nforms of mind, matter, and energy that make up the world we live in. The\\ntattvas are listed in the Gita:\\nThe field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense\\nperception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs\\nof action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and\\nahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy [prakriti] from which all\\nthese evolved. (13:5)\\nI know of no English words to use for most of these twenty-four\\nconstituents. Manas corresponds roughly to mind the way that word is\\ncommonly used; buddhi is the discriminative faculty, the discriminating\\nintellect; ahamkara, literally “I-maker,” is the sense of ego. I have used\\nsuch rough labels in the translation which follows, but really they are\\ntechnical terms with precise definitions, each associated with a specific\\nfunction and level of consciousness. Approximations are misleading\\nbecause they bring in associations from Western philosophy, which has a\\nwholly different orientation. Behind all these categories lies a powerful,\\npractical assumption: Sankhya is not trying to describe physical reality; it is\\n\\n\\x0canalyzing consciousness, knowledge, for the sole purpose of unraveling the\\nhuman being’s true identity. So it does not begin with the material universe\\nas something different and separate from the mind that perceives it. It does\\nnot talk about sense objects outside us and senses within and then try to get\\nthe two together. It begins with one world of experience. Sense objects and\\nsenses are not separate; they are two aspects of the same event. Mind,\\nenergy, and matter are a continuum, and the universe is not described as it\\nmight be in itself, but as it presents itself to the human mind. As they say in\\nthe “new physics,” it is not just an observable universe but a participatory\\nuniverse.\\nLet me illustrate. This morning I had a fresh mango for breakfast: a large,\\nbeautiful, fragrant one which had been allowed to ripen until just the right\\nmoment, when the skin was luminous with reds and oranges. You can see\\nfrom that kind of description that I like mangoes. I must have eaten\\nthousands of them when I was growing up, and I probably know most\\nvarieties intimately by their color, shape, flavor, fragrance, and feel.\\nSankhya would say that this mango I appreciated so much does not exist\\nin the world outside – at least, not with the qualities I ascribed to it. The\\nmango-in-itself, for example, is not red and orange; these are categories of a\\nnervous system that can deal only with a narrow range of radiant energy.\\nMy dog Bogart would not see a luscious red and orange mango. He would\\nsee some gray mass with no distinguishing features, much less interesting to\\nhim than a piece of buttered toast. But my mind takes in messages from five\\nsenses and fits them into a precise mango-form in consciousness, and that\\nform – nothing outside – is what I experience. Not that there is no “real”\\nmango! But what I experience, the objects of my sense perception and my\\n“knowing,” are in consciousness, nowhere else. A brilliant neuroscientist I\\nwas reading recently says something similar in contemporary language: we\\nnever really encounter the world; all we experience is our own nervous\\nsystem.\\nWhen the Gita says that the material world is made up of five “material\\nelements,” then, it is talking about the world as we perceive it through our\\nfive senses. The objects of this world are in the mind, not outside. “Physical\\nobjects” in this sense require a mental component also: five “essences” or\\nmental conditions of perception, each corresponding to one of the five\\nsenses. From these five tanmatras derive on the one hand the five sense\\norgans, and on the other hand the five material elements. You can see that\\n\\n\\x0cthe number five and the correspondences of Sankhya are not arbitrary, but\\nreflect the ways we have of sorting electrical information supplied to the\\nbrain.\\nFour of these elements have names similar to those from ancient\\nphilosophy in the West – earth, air, fire, and water. But if we remember that\\nwe are talking about principles of perception rather than “earth-stuff,” “firestuff,” and so on, it should become clear that this is not an antiquated theory\\nleft behind by the progress of physical science. It is quite sophisticated and\\naccommodates contemporary physical thought rather well, for it recognizes\\nthat in the act of knowing, the mind conditions what is known.\\nSenses and sense objects, then, are very intimately related. There is a\\ncausal connection, for example, between the things we see and the physical\\norgan of seeing, the eye and its related branches of the nervous system: both\\ndepend on the underlying form in the mind that conditions how we perceive\\nlight. The objects we see are shaped by the way we see. So senses and sense\\nobjects “make sense” only together: each is incomplete without the other.\\nThat is why there is such a strong pull between senses and sense objects.\\nOn the other hand, the Gita says, this pull has nothing to do with us – the\\nSelf, the knower. When Krishna keeps telling Arjuna to train his mind to be\\nalike in pleasure and pain, he is simply being practical: to discover unity,\\nconsciousness has to be withdrawn from the hold of the senses, which ties it\\nto duality.\\nWhen the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or\\nheat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and\\ngo. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. Those who are not affected by these\\nchanges, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit\\nfor immortality. (2:14–15)\\nThe sensory attraction of pleasure is just an interaction between inert\\nelements of similar stuff, very much like a magnetic pull between two\\nobjects. We are not involved. When I look at a fresh, ripe mango, it is\\nnatural for my senses to respond; that is their nature. But I should be able to\\nstand aside and watch this interaction with detachment, the way people\\nstand and watch while movers unload a van. In that way I can enjoy what\\nmy senses report without ever having to act compulsively on their likes and\\ndislikes.\\n\\n\\x0cSankhya’s explanation of mind and body has profound implications for\\npsychosomatic medicine. In a system where mental phenomena and\\nbiochemical events take place in the same field, it is much easier to account\\nfor how ways of thinking affect the body. If one idea is central to yoga\\npsychology, it is that thoughts are real and have real, tangible consequences,\\nas we saw in the discussion of karma. Sankhya describes thoughts as\\npackets of potential energy, which grow more and more solid when\\nfavorable conditions are present and obstacles are removed. They become\\ndesires, then habits, then ways of living with physical consequences. Those\\nconsequences may look no more like thoughts than an oak tree looks like an\\nacorn, but the Gita says they are just as intimately related. Just as a seed can\\ngrow into only one kind of tree, thoughts can produce effects only of the\\nsame nature. Kindness to others, to take just one example, favors a nervous\\nsystem that is kind to itself.\\nThe Forces of Evolution\\n\\nSankhya describes prakriti as a field of forces called gunas – a concept that\\ngets a good deal of attention in the Gita.\\nAccording to Sankhya, the evolution of primordial prakriti into mind and\\nmatter begins when the equilibrium of prakriti is disturbed. In Hindu myth\\nthis is the dawn of the Day of Brahma (8:17–21), a period of explosive\\nexpansion not unlike the Big Bang of modern cosmology. At this instant of\\ncreation, thrown into imbalance, prakriti differentiates itself into three basic\\nstates or qualities of primordial energy. These are the gunas. Every state of\\nmatter and mind is a combination of these three: tamas, inertia, rajas,\\nactivity, and sattva, harmony or equilibrium. These are only rough\\ntranslations, for the gunas have no equivalent in any other philosophy I\\nknow.\\nThe gunas can be illustrated by comparison with the three states of matter\\nin classical physics: solid, liquid, and gas. Tamas is frozen energy, the\\nresistance of inertia. A block of ice has a good deal of energy in the\\nchemical bonds that hold it together, but the energy is locked in, bound up,\\nrigid. When the ice melts, some of that energy is released as the water\\nflows; rajas, activity, is like a swollen river, full of uncontrolled power. And\\nsattva, harmony, can be compared with steam when its power is harnessed.\\nThese are very imprecise parallels, but they convey an important point\\n\\n\\x0cabout the gunas: all three are states of energy, and each can be converted\\ninto the others.\\nGuna means strand, and in the Gita the gunas are described as the very\\nfabric of existence, the veil that hides unity in a covering of diversity.\\nTamas is maya’s power of concealment, the darkness or ignorance that\\nhides unitive reality; rajas distracts and scatters awareness, turning it away\\nfrom reality toward the diversity of the outside world. Thus the gunas are\\nessentially born of the mind. When the mind’s activity is stilled, we see life\\nas it is.\\nWe can also think of the gunas as different levels of consciousness.\\nTamas, the lowest level, is the vast unconscious, a chaotic dumping ground\\nfor the residue of past mental states. “Unconscious” in this sense has\\nsomething in common with Jung’s collective unconscious, in that it is the\\nrepository not only of past experiences but also of our evolutionary\\nheritage, the basic drives of the human being’s animal past. This record is\\nshared, of course, by all human beings, and at its deepest levels the\\nunconscious is universal. There is no choice in tamas, no awareness; this is\\ncomplete ignorance of the unity of life, ignorance of any other need than\\none’s own basic urges.\\nRajas is what we ordinarily mean by mind, the incessant stream of\\nthought that races along, desiring, worrying, resenting, scheming,\\ncompeting, frustrating and getting frustrated. Rajas is power released, but\\nuncontrolled and egocentric.\\nSattva, finally, is the so-called higher mind – detached, unruffled, selfcontrolled. This is not a state of repressive regulation, but the natural\\nharmony that comes with unity of purpose, character, and desire. Negative\\nstates of mind do still come up, prompted by tamas and rajas, but there is no\\nneed to act on them.\\nAccording to Sankhya, everything in the world of mind and matter is an\\nexpression of all three gunas, with one guna always predominant. This\\nbecomes particularly interesting in describing personality as a field of\\nforces. The rajasic person is full of energy; the tamasic person is sluggish,\\nindifferent, insensitive; the sattvic person, calm, resourceful,\\ncompassionate, and selfless. Yet all three are always present at some level\\nof awareness, and their proportions change: their interplay is the dynamics\\nof personality. The same individual will have times when he is bursting\\nwith energy and times when inertia descends and paralyzes his will, times\\n\\n\\x0cwhen he is thoughtful and other times when he is moving so fast that he\\nnever notices those around him. The person is the same; he is simply\\nexperiencing the play of the gunas. As long as he identifies with his body\\nand mind, he is at the mercy of this play. But the Self is not involved in the\\ngunas’ interaction; it is witness rather than participant:\\nWithout senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses.\\nCompletely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it\\nenjoys their play. (13:14)\\nThe gunas form the basis of the most compassionate account of human\\nnature I have come across in any philosophy or psychology, East or West.\\nThey not only explain differences in character; they describe the basic\\nforces of personality and allow the possibility of reshaping ourselves after a\\nhigher ideal. Because personality is a process, the human being is\\nconstantly remaking himself or herself. Left to itself, the mind goes on\\nrepeating the same old habitual patterns of personality. By training the\\nmind, however, anyone can learn to step in and change old ways of\\nthinking; that is the central principle of yoga:\\nReshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be\\ndegraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the\\nwill is the only enemy of the Self. (6:5)\\nThe Gita speaks of this kind of growth as part of spiritual evolution. In its\\nnatural state, consciousness is a continuous flow of awareness. But through\\nthe distorting action of the gunas, we have fallen from this native state into\\nfragmented, sometimes stagnant awareness. Seeing through a divided mind,\\nwe see life divided wherever we look: separate selves, antagonistic\\ninterests, conflicts within ourselves. Evolution, according to the Gita, is a\\npainfully slow return to our native state. First tamas must be transformed\\ninto rajas – apathy and insensitiveness into energetic, enthusiastic activity.\\nBut the energy of rajas is self-centered and dispersed; it must be harnessed\\nto a higher ideal by the will. Then it becomes sattva, when all this\\npassionate energy is channeled into selfless action. This state is marked by\\nhappiness, a calm mind, abundant vitality, and the concentration of genius.\\nBut even this is not the end. The goal of evolution is to return to unity:\\nthat is, to still the mind. Then the soul rests in pure, unitary consciousness,\\n\\n\\x0cwhich is a state of permanent joy.\\nIn the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself.\\nBeholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and\\npeace of complete fulfillment. (6:20)\\nTHE ESSENCE OF THE GITA\\n\\nThe Gita does not present a system of philosophy. It offers something to\\nevery seeker after God, of whatever temperament, by whatever path. The\\nreason for this universal appeal is that it is basically practical: it is a\\nhandbook for Self-realization and a guide to action.\\nSome scholars will find practicality a tall claim, because the Gita is full\\nof lofty and even abstruse philosophy. Yet even its philosophy is not there\\nto satisfy intellectual curiosity; it is meant to explain to spiritual aspirants\\nwhy they are asked to undergo certain disciplines. Like any handbook, the\\nGita makes most sense when it is practiced.\\nAs the traditional chapter titles put it, the Gita is brahmavidyayam\\nyogashastra, a textbook on the supreme science of yoga. But yoga is a word\\nwith many meanings – as many, perhaps, as there are paths to Selfrealization. What kind of yoga does the Gita teach?\\nThe common answer is that it presents three yogas or even four – the four\\nmain paths of Hindu mysticism. In jnana yoga, the yoga of knowledge,\\naspirants use their will and discrimination to disidentify themselves from\\nthe body, mind, and senses until they know they are nothing but the Self.\\nThe followers of bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion, achieve the same goal\\nby identifying themselves completely with the Lord in love; by and large,\\nthis is the path taken by most of the mystics of Christianity, Judaism, and\\nIslam. In karma yoga, the yoga of selfless action, the aspirants dissolve\\ntheir identification with body and mind by identifying with the whole of\\nlife, forgetting the finite self in the service of others. And the followers of\\nraja yoga, the yoga of meditation, discipline the mind and senses until the\\nmind-process is suspended in a healing stillness and they merge in the Self.\\nIndians like to classify, and the eighteen chapters of the Gita are said to\\nbreak into three six-chapter parts. The first third, according to this, deals\\nwith karma yoga, the second with jnana yoga, and the last with bhakti yoga:\\nthat is, the Gita begins with the way of selfless action, passes into the way\\nof Self-knowledge, and ends with the way of love. This scheme is not tight,\\n\\n\\x0cand non-Hindu readers may find it difficult to discover in the text. But the\\nthemes are there, and Krishna clearly shifts his emphasis as he goes on\\nusing this one word yoga. Here he focuses on transcendental knowledge,\\nthere on selfless action, here on meditation, there on love.\\nThus the Gita offers something for every kind of spiritual aspirant, and\\nfor two thousand years each of the major schools of Indian philosophy has\\nquoted the Gita in defense of its particular claims. This fluidity sometimes\\nexasperates scholars, who feel the Gita contradicts itself. It also puzzled\\nArjuna, the faithful representative of you and me. “Krishna,” he says at the\\nbeginning of chapter 3, “you’ve been telling me that knowledge [jnana] is\\nbetter than action [karma]; so why do you urge me into such terrible action?\\nYour words are inconsistent; they confuse me. Tell me one path to the\\nhighest good” (3:1–2). No doubt he speaks for every reader at this point,\\nand for those who go on wanting one path only, the confusion simply grows\\nworse.\\nFor those who try to practice the Gita, however, there is a thread of inner\\nconsistency running through Krishna’s advice. Like a person walking\\naround the same object, the Gita takes more than one point of view.\\nWhenever Krishna describes one of the traditional paths to God he looks at\\nit from the inside, extolling its virtues over the others. For the time being,\\nthat is the path; when he talks about yoga, he means that one particular\\nyoga. Thus “this ancient word” yoga, says Gandhi’s intimate friend and\\nsecretary, Mahadev Desai,\\nis pressed by the Gita into service to mean the entire gamut of human\\nendeavor to storm the gates of heaven. . . . [It means] the yoking of all\\nthe powers of the body and the mind and soul to God; it means the\\ndiscipline of the intellect, the mind, the emotions, the will, which such a\\nyoking presupposes; it means a poise of the soul which enables one to\\nlook at life in all its aspects and evenly.\\nThe Gita brings together all the specialized senses of the word yoga to\\nemphasize their common meaning: the sum of what one must do to realize\\nthe Self.\\nThe thread through Krishna’s teaching, the essence of the Gita, can be\\ngiven in one word: renunciation. This is the common factor in the four\\nyogas. It is a bleak word in English, conjuring up the austerity and self-\\n\\n\\x0cdeprivation enjoined on the monastic orders – the “poverty, chastity, and\\nobedience” so perfectly embodied by Francis of Assisi. When the Gita\\npromises “freedom through renunciation,” the impression most of us get is\\nthat we are being asked to give up everything we want out of life; in this\\ndrab state, having lost whatever we value, we will be free from sorrow.\\nWho wants that kind of freedom?\\nBut this is not at all what the Gita means. It does not even enjoin material\\nrenunciation, although it certainly encourages simplicity. As always, its\\nemphasis is on the mind. It teaches that we can become free by giving up\\nnot material things, but selfish attachments to material things – and, more\\nimportant, to people. It asks us to renounce not the enjoyment of life, but\\nthe clinging to selfish enjoyment whatever it may cost others. It pleads, in a\\nword, for the renunciation of selfishness in thought, word, and action – a\\ntheme that is common to all mystics, West and East alike.\\nMahatma Gandhi encapsulates the Gita’s message in one phrase:\\nnishkama karma, selfless action, work free from any selfish motives. In this\\nspecial sense, whatever path the Gita is presenting at a given time, it\\nremains essentially a manual of karma yoga, for it is addressed to the\\nperson who wants to realize God without giving up an active life in the\\nworld. In the Gita the four traditional yogas are not watertight\\ncompartments, and in practice, all of them blend and support each other on\\nthe path to Self-realization.\\nNishkama karma means literally work that is without kama, that is,\\nwithout selfish desire. This word kama – indeed the whole idea of desire in\\nHindu and Buddhist psychology – is frequently misunderstood. These\\nreligions, it is sometimes held, teach an ideal of desireless action, a nirvana\\nequated with the extinction of all desires. This drab view is far from the\\ntruth. Desire is the fuel of life; without desire nothing can be achieved, let\\nalone so stupendous a feat as Self-realization. Kama is not desire; it is\\nselfish desire. The Buddha calls it tanha,“ thirst”: the fierce, compulsive\\ncraving for personal satisfaction that demands to be slaked at any cost,\\nwhether to oneself or to others. Thus the concept also includes what\\nWestern mystics call self-will – the naked ego insisting on getting what it\\nwants for its own gratification. The Gita teaches simply that this selfish\\ncraving is what makes a person feel separate from the rest of life. When it is\\nextinguished – the literal meaning of nirvana – the mask of the transient,\\npetty empirical ego falls, revealing our real Self.\\n\\n\\x0cWork hard in the world without any selfish attachment, the Gita counsels,\\nand you will purify your consciousness of self-will. In this way any man or\\nwoman can gradually attain freedom from the bondage of selfish\\nconditioning.\\nThis is a mental discipline, not just a physical one, and I want to repeat\\nthat to understand the Gita, it is important to look beneath the surface of its\\ninjunctions and see the mental state involved. Nishkama karma is not “good\\nworks” or philanthropic activity; work can benefit others and still carry a\\nsubstantial measure of ego involvement. Such work is good, but it is not\\nyoga. It may benefit others, but it will not necessarily benefit the doer.\\nEverything depends on the state of mind. Action without selfish motive\\npurifies the mind: the doer is less likely to be ego-driven later. The same\\naction done with a selfish motive entangles a person further, precisely by\\nstrengthening that motive so it is more likely to prompt selfish action again.\\nIn the Gita this is said in many ways, and from differences in language it\\nmay seem that Krishna is giving different pieces of advice. In practice,\\nhowever, it becomes evident that these are only various ways of saying the\\nsame thing.\\nTo begin with, Krishna often tells Arjuna to “renounce the fruits of\\naction” (karma-phala):\\nYou have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should\\nnever engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for\\ninaction. Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established\\nwithin himself – without selfish attachments, and alike in success and\\ndefeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. (2:47–48)\\n“Fruits,” of course, means the outcome. What Krishna means is to give\\nup attachment to the results of what you do: that is, to give your best to\\nevery undertaking without insisting that the results work out the way you\\nwant, or even whether what you do is pleasant or unpleasant. “You have the\\nright to action, but not to the fruits of action”: each of us has the obligation\\nto act rightly, but no power to dictate what is to come of what we do.\\nMahatma Gandhi explains with the authority of his personal experience:\\nBy detachment I mean that you must not worry whether the desired\\nresult follows from your action or not, so long as your motive is pure,\\n\\n\\x0cyour means correct. Really, it means that things will come right in the\\nend if you take care of the means and leave the rest to Him.\\n“But renunciation of fruit,” Gandhi warns,\\nin no way means indifference to the result. In regard to every action one\\nmust know the result that is expected to follow, the means thereto, and\\nthe capacity for it. He who, being thus equipped, is without desire for\\nthe result and is yet wholly engrossed in the due fulfillment of the task\\nbefore him, is said to have renounced the fruits of his action.\\nThis attitude frees us completely. Whatever comes – success or failure,\\npraise or blame, victory or defeat – we can give our best with a clear,\\nunruffled mind. Nothing can shake our courage or break our will; no\\nsetback can depress us or make us feel “burned out.” Clearly, as the Gita\\nsays, “Yoga is skill in action” (2:50).\\nOnly the person who is utterly detached and utterly dedicated, Gandhi\\nsays, is free to enjoy life. Asked to sum up his life “in twenty-five words or\\nless,” he replied, “I can do it in three!” and quoted the Isha Upanishad:\\n“Renounce and enjoy.” Those who are compulsively attached to the results\\nof action cannot really enjoy what they do; they get downcast when things\\ndo not work out and cling more desperately when they do. So the Gita\\nclassifies the karma of attachment as pleasant at first, but “bitter as poison\\nin the end” (18:38), because of the painful bondage of conditioning.\\nAgain, Krishna repeatedly tells Arjuna to surrender everything to him in\\nlove. But this is not different advice, merely different words. Krishna is\\nasking Arjuna to act entirely for His sake, not for any personal gain. The\\nwhole point of the path of love is to transform motivation from “I, I, I” to\\n“thou, thou, thou” – that is, to surrender selfish attachments by dissolving\\nthem in the desire to give.\\nKrishna puts this most beautifully in the famous verses of Chapter 9\\nwhich begin, “Whatever you do, make it an offering to me” (9:27). Do it,\\nthat is, not for personal reward but out of love for the Lord, present in every\\ncreature. “Whatever you eat, whatever worship you perform, whatever you\\ngive, whatever you suffer”: everything is to be done and given and endured\\nand enjoyed for the sake of the Lord in all, not for ourselves. Manmana:\\nthis is the refrain of the Gita. Krishna tells Arjuna repeatedly, “Fill your\\n\\n\\x0cmind with me, focus every thought on me, think of me always”; then “you\\nwill be united with me” (see 9:34). The same injunction was given to Moses\\nand reiterated by Jesus and Mohammed. In practical terms, it means that\\nawareness will be integrated down to the deepest recesses of the\\nunconscious, which is precisely the significance of the word yoga.\\nMeister Eckhart says eloquently of this state:\\nWhoever has God in mind, simply and solely God, in all things, such a\\nman carries God with him into all his works and into all places, and God\\nalone does all his works. He seeks nothing but God; nothing seems good\\nto him but God. He becomes one with God in every thought. Just as no\\nmultiplicity can dissipate God, so nothing can dissipate this man or\\nmake him multiple.\\nThus we arrive at the idea of “actionless action”: of persons so\\nestablished in identification with the Self that in the midst of tireless service\\nof those around them, they remain in inner peace, the still witness of action.\\nThey do not act, the Gita says; it is the Self that acts through them: “They\\nalone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the\\nSelf remains unmoved” (13:29). Again, this is a universal testimony. Here\\nis one of the most active of mystics, St. Catherine of Genoa:\\nWhen the soul is naughted and transformed, then of herself she neither\\nworks nor speaks nor wills, nor feels nor hears nor understands; neither\\nhas she of herself the feeling of outward or inward, where she may\\nmove. And in all things it is God who rules and guides her, without the\\nmediation of any creature. And the state of this soul is then a feeling of\\nsuch utter peace and tranquility that it seems to her that her heart, and\\nher bodily being, and all both within and without, is immersed in an\\nocean of utmost peace. . . . And she is so full of peace that though she\\npress her flesh, her nerves, her bones, no other thing comes forth from\\nthem than peace.\\nAgain, when the Gita talks about “inaction in the midst of action” (4:18,\\netc.), we can call on Ruysbroeck to illumine the seeming paradox. The\\nperson who has realized God, he says, mirrors both His aspects: “tranquility\\naccording to His essence, activity according to His nature: absolute repose,\\nabsolute fecundity.” And he adds,\\n\\n\\x0cThe interior person lives his life according to these two ways; that is to\\nsay, in rest and in work. And in each of them he is wholly and\\nundividedly; for he dwells wholly in God in virtue of his restful fruition\\nand wholly in himself in virtue of his active love. . . . This is the\\nsupreme summit of the inner life.\\nThis is the only kind of inaction the Gita recommends. It is action of the\\nmost tireless kind; the only thing inactive is the ego. To live without the\\ndaily sacrifice (yajna) of selfless service – to work just for oneself, or\\nworse, to do nothing at all – is simply to be a thief (3:12). It is not possible\\nto do nothing, Krishna says; the very nature of the mind is incessant\\nactivity. The Gita’s goal is to harness this activity in selfless service,\\nremoving the poisonous agency of the ego: “As long as one has a body, one\\ncannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire\\nfor personal reward” (18:11). Meister Eckhart explains,\\nTo be right, a person must do one of two things: either he must learn to\\nhave God in his work and hold fast to him there, or he must give up his\\nwork altogether. Since, however, man cannot live without activities that\\nare both human and various, we must learn to keep God in everything\\nwe do, and whatever the job or place, keep on with him, letting nothing\\nstand in our way.\\nIt would be difficult to find a better summary of the Gita’s message\\nanywhere – and this, incidentally, from someone considered to represent the\\npath of knowledge.\\nKrishna wraps all this up in one famous verse: “Abandon all supports and\\nlook to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not\\ngrieve” (18:66). Krishna is the Self; the words mean simply to cast aside\\nexternal props and dependencies and rely on the Self alone, seeking\\nstrength nowhere but within.\\nWhy does selfless action lead to Self-realization? It is not a matter of\\n“good” action being divinely rewarded. Self-realization is not some kind of\\ncompensation for good deeds. We can understand the dynamics if we\\nremember that the Gita’s emphasis is on the mind. Most human activity,\\ngood and bad, is tainted by ego-involvement. Such activity cannot purify\\nconsciousness, because it goes on generating new karma in the mind – in\\n\\n\\x0cpractical terms, we go on getting entangled in what we do. Selfless work\\npurifies consciousness because when there is no trace of ego involvement,\\nnew karma is not produced; the mind is simply working out the karma it has\\nalready accumulated.\\nShankara illustrates this with the simile of a potter’s wheel. The ego’s job\\nis to go on incessantly spinning the wheel of the mind and making karmapots: new ideas to act on, fresh desires to pursue. When this pointless\\nactivity stops, no more pots are made, but for a while the wheel of the mind\\ngoes on spinning out of the momentum of its past karma. This is an\\nanguishing period in the life of every mystic: you have done everything you\\ncan; now you can only wait with a kind of impatient patience. Eventually,\\nfor no reason that one can understand, the wheel does come to a stop,\\ndissolving the mind-process in samadhi.\\nA HIGHER IMAGE\\n\\nPerhaps the clearest way to grasp the Gita is to look at the way it describes\\nthose who embody its teachings. There are portraits like this at the\\nbeginning of the Gita, the middle, and the end, each offering a model of our\\nfull human potential.\\nThe first is given at the end of chapter 2 (2:54–72), verses which Gandhi\\nsaid hold the key to the entire Gita. Arjuna has just been told about Selfknowledge; now he asks a very practical question: when a person attains\\nthis knowledge, how does it show? How do such people conduct\\nthemselves in everyday life? We expect a list of virtues. Instead, Krishna\\ndelivers a surprise: the surest sign is that they have banished all selfish\\ndesires. Their senses and mind are completely trained, so they are free from\\nsensory cravings and self-will. Identified completely with the Self, not with\\nbody or mind, they realize their immortality here on earth.\\nThe implications of this are not spelled out; we have to see them in a\\nliving person. G. K. Chesterton once said that to understand the Sermon on\\nthe Mount, we should look not at Christ but at St. Francis. To understand\\nthe Gita I went to look at Mahatma Gandhi, who had done his best for forty\\nyears to translate those verses into his daily life. Seeing him, I understood\\nthat those “who see themselves in all and all in them” would simply not be\\ncapable of harming others. Augustine says daringly, “Love, then do as you\\nlike”: nothing will come out of you but goodness. I saw too what it meant to\\nview one’s body with detachment: not indifference, but compassionate care\\n\\n\\x0cas an instrument of service. I saw what it means to rest in the midst of\\nintense action. Most important, I grasped one of the most refreshing ideas in\\nHindu mysticism: original goodness. Since the Self is the core of every\\npersonality, no one needs to acquire goodness or compassion; they are\\nalready there. All that is necessary is to remove the selfish habits that hide\\nthem.\\nChapter 12 gives another portrait in its closing verses (12:13–20), and\\nhere we do get an inspiring list of the marks of those who follow the path of\\nlove:\\nThat one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and\\ncompassionate. Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure\\nand pain, patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their\\nheart and all their mind given to me – with such as these I am in love.\\n(12:13–14)\\nAnd finally comes the passionate description with which the Gita ends,\\nwhen Krishna tells Arjuna how to recognize the man or woman who has\\nreached life’s supreme goal:\\nOne who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself\\nand his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action.\\nListen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained\\nperfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom.\\n(18:49–50)\\nThese are not separate paths, separate ideals. All three passages describe\\none person: vital, active, compassionate, self-reliant in the highest sense, for\\nhe looks to the Self for everything and needs nothing from life but the\\nopportunity to give. In brief, such a person knows who he is, and in that\\nknowing is everything.\\nThis is not running away from life, as is so often claimed. It is running\\ninto life, open-handed, open-armed: “flying, running, and rejoicing,” says\\nThomas à Kempis, for “he is free and will not be bound,” never entangled\\nin self-doubts, conflict, or vacillation. Far from being desireless – look at\\nGandhi, St. Catherine of Siena, St. Teresa, St. Francis – the man or woman\\nwho realizes God has yoked all human passions to the overriding desire to\\ngive and love and serve; and in that unification we can see, not the\\n\\n\\x0cextinction of personality, but its full blossoming. This is what it means to be\\nfully human; our ordinary lives of stimulus and response, getting and\\nspending, seem by comparison as faint as remembered dreams. This\\nflowering of the spirit appeals, I think, to everyone. “This is the true joy in\\nlife,” says Bernard Shaw:\\nthe being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; . .\\n. the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of\\nailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote\\nitself to making you happy.\\nInstead of “Nature” with a capital N, of course, the Gita would say “an\\ninstrument of the Self”; but that is the only difference. One of the most\\nappealing features of the Gita for our times is that it clears up\\nmisunderstandings about the spiritual life and shows it for what it is: active,\\njoyful, intentional, a middle path between extremes that transfigures\\neveryday living.\\nFAITH AND SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION\\n\\nOne last untranslatable concept and I will let the Gita speak for itself. That\\nconcept is shraddha, and its nearest English equivalent is faith. I have\\ntranslated it as such, but shraddha means much more. It is literally “that\\nwhich is placed in the heart”: all the beliefs we hold so deeply that we never\\nthink to question them. It is the set of values, axioms, prejudices, and\\nprepossessions that colors our perceptions, governs our thinking, dictates\\nour responses, and shapes our lives, generally without our even being aware\\nof its presence and power.\\nThis may sound philosophical, but shraddha is not an intellectual\\nabstraction. It is our very substance. The Gita says, “A person is what his\\nshraddha is” (17:3). The Bible uses almost the same words: “As a man\\nthinketh in his heart, so is he.” Shraddha reflects everything that we have\\nmade ourselves and points to what we have become. But there is nothing\\npassive about shraddha. It is full of potency, for it prompts action,\\nconditions behavior, and determines how we see and therefore respond to\\nthe world around us.\\nWhen Norman Cousins talks about a “belief system” analogous to the\\nbody’s organ systems, that is one aspect of shraddha; he is referring to the\\n\\n\\x0cpower to heal or harm that is inherent in our ideas of ourselves. One person\\nwith a serious illness believes he has a contribution to make to the world\\nand so he recovers; another believes his life is worthless and he dies: that is\\nthe power of shraddha. Similarly, self-image is part of shraddha. One\\nperson believes she will succeed in life and overcomes great obstacles;\\nanother, who believes she can do nothing, may be more gifted and face\\nfewer difficulties but accomplish very little.\\nYet shraddha is not brute determination or wishful thinking. When St.\\nJohn of the Cross says “We live in what we love,” he is explaining\\nshraddha. This is our world. Our lives are an eloquent expression of our\\nbelief: what we deem worth having, doing, attaining, being. What we strive\\nfor shows what we value; we back our shraddha with our time, our energy,\\nour very lives.\\nThus shraddha determines destiny. As the Buddha puts it, “All that we\\nare is the result of what we have thought. We are made of our thoughts; we\\nare molded by our thoughts.” As we think, so we become. This is true not\\nonly of individuals but of societies, institutions, and civilizations, according\\nto the dominant ideas that shape their actions. Faith in technology, for\\nexample, is part of the shraddha of modern civilization.\\n“Right shraddha,” according to the Gita, is faith in spiritual laws: in the\\nunity of life, the presence of divinity in every person, the essentially\\nspiritual nature of the human being. “Wrong shraddha” is not necessarily\\nmorally wrong, merely ignorant. It means believing that there is no more to\\nlife than physical existence, that the human being is only a biochemical\\nentity, that happiness can be got by pursuing private interests and ignoring\\nthe rest of life. Such beliefs are misplaced: we have attached our shraddha\\nto beliefs that life cannot bear out. Sooner or later they must prove false,\\nand then our shraddha changes. Like our thinking, therefore – like we\\nourselves – shraddha evolves. The purpose of karma is to teach the\\nconsequences of shraddha, so that by trial and error, life after life, the\\nindividual soul acquires the kind of faith that leads to fulfillment of life’s\\nsupreme goal. Krishna explains the dynamics:\\nWhen a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his\\nfaith in that. Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the\\nobject of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. (7:21–\\n22)\\n\\n\\x0cThis is perhaps the most compassionate insight into human evolution\\never expressed. The Gita is steeped in it, but it is not exclusive to the Gita\\nor to Hinduism. “Whether you like it or not, whether you know it or not,”\\nsays Meister Eckhart, “secretly Nature seeks and hunts and tries to ferret\\nout the track in which God may be found.” The whole purpose of every\\nexperience, every activity, every faculty, is to turn the human being inward\\nand lead each of us back to our divine source. Thus every person seeking\\nsatisfaction in the world outside – pleasure, power, profit, prestige – is\\nreally looking for God: “As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths,\\nArjuna, lead to me” (4:11).\\nTwo forces pervade human life, the Gita says: the upward thrust of\\nevolution and the downward pull of our evolutionary past. Ultimately, then,\\nthe Gita is not a book of commandments but a book of choices. It does\\nmention sin, but mostly it talks about ignorance and its consequences.\\nKrishna tells Arjuna about the Self, the forces of the mind, the relationship\\nbetween thought and action, the law of karma, and then concludes, “Now,\\nArjuna, reflect on these words and then do as you choose” (18:63). The\\nstruggle is between two halves of human nature, and choices are posed\\nevery moment. Everyone who has accepted this challenge, I think, will\\ntestify that life offers no fiercer battle than this war within. We have no\\nchoice about the fighting; it is built into human nature. But we do have the\\nchoice of which side to fight on:\\nRemembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace.\\nBut if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. If\\nyou egotistically say, “I will not fight this battle,” your resolve will be\\nuseless; your own nature will drive you into it. (18:58–59)\\nTherefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and\\nmind intent on me, you will surely come to me. (8:7)\\nThus the Gita places human destiny entirely in human hands. Its world is\\nnot deterministic, but neither is it an expression of blind chance: we shape\\nourselves and our world by what we believe and think and act on, whether\\nfor good or for ill. In this sense the Gita opens not on Kurukshetra but on\\ndharmakshetra, the field of dharma, where Arjuna and Krishna are standing\\nfor us all.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter One\\n\\nThe War Within\\nSri Krishna consoles and instructs Prince Arjuna as he is about to go into\\nbattle against family and friends to defend his older brother’s claim to the\\nancient throne of the Kurus. Thus the great scripture called Bhagavad Gita,\\nthe “Song of the Lord,” begins. Sri Krishna is Bhagavan, “the Lord,” the\\nmysterious incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the aspect of God who fosters and\\npreserves the universe against the forces constantly working to destroy and\\ncorrupt it. Krishna has appeared on earth as a royal prince of the house of\\nthe Yadavas; thus he combines earthly majesty with a hidden spiritual\\npower. Most know him only as an unimportant prince, but the wise have\\nseen him reveal his power to destroy evil and protect the good.\\nThe battle of the Bhagavad Gita is not Krishna’s fight, however; it is\\nArjuna’s. Krishna is only Arjuna’s charioteer and advisor. He has promised\\nArjuna that he will be with him throughout the ordeal, but much as he\\npassionately hopes for Arjuna’s victory, he has sworn to be a noncombatant\\nin the struggle. A charioteer’s position is a lowly one compared to the status\\nand glory of the warrior he drives, but Krishna assumes this modest role out\\nof love for Arjuna. As charioteer, he is in a perfect position to give advice\\nand encouragement to Arjuna without violating his promise not to join the\\nfight himself.\\nTo secure their claim to the throne, Arjuna and his brothers must fight not\\nan alien army but their own cousins, who have held the kingdom for many\\nyears. Tragically, the forces against them include their own uncle, the blind\\nking Dhritarashtra, and even the revered teachers and elders who guided\\nArjuna and his brothers when they were young. Arjuna, of course, wants to\\nwin the throne for his brother, who is the rightful heir to the Kuru dynasty\\nand has endured many wrongs. But he is dismayed at the prospect of\\nfighting his own people. Thus, on the morning the great battle is to begin,\\nhe turns to Krishna, his friend and spiritual advisor, and asks him the deeper\\nquestions about life that he has never asked before. The Bhagavad Gita is\\nKrishna’s answer.\\nOther warriors who appear elsewhere in the drama are mentioned in this\\nfirst chapter of the Gita. To Indians these are familiar figures from the\\n\\n\\x0clegendary past, but to most Western readers they will be unknown and even\\nunpronounceable names. Arjuna and his brothers are known as the\\nPandavas, “the sons of Pandu”: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Sahadeva,\\nand Nakula. The other side is called the Kauravas, “the sons of Kuru.” This\\nis somewhat misleading, for both sides of the royal family are Kurus by\\nbirth. But the Pandavas are now in the position of appearing to be the\\ndissident faction, so they are called “sons of Pandu” to distinguish them\\nfrom the larger family.\\nPandu was once king of the kingdom of Hastinapura, but he retired into\\nthe forest on spiritual retreat and died young. His elder brother,\\nDhritarashtra, was blind since birth, so he was never named ruler, but he did\\nshare power with his brother. When Pandu died his eldest son, Yudhishthira,\\nshould have succeeded him; but because Yudhishthira was only a boy,\\nDhritarashtra continued on after Pandu’s death.\\nAs time passed, however, Dhritarashtra’s attachment to his own eldest\\nson, Duryodhana, gradually overcame him. Instead of rising to royal\\nimpartiality and allowing Yudhishthira his fair claim, the old, blind king\\nbegan to connive at his son’s demand to succeed to the throne. Actually, the\\nline of succession had grown convoluted over several generations, and it\\nwas not unthinkable that Duryodhana should rule next. But Yudhishthira’s\\noutstanding qualities and Duryodhana’s corruption gradually decided the\\nissue, at least from the moral point of view. For Duryodhana, the conflict\\ncould be resolved only on the battlefield.\\nOther warriors are mentioned briefly in chapter 1. Two particularly\\nimportant figures in the Mahabharata story are Drona and Bhishma. Drona\\nwas born a brahmin, a member of the priestly caste, but in search of wealth\\nhe took up the way of the warrior and excelled in the knowledge of arms.\\nHe was the teacher, the guru, of all the royal princes in their youth, the sons\\nof Pandu and the sons of Dhritarashtra alike. Thus it was he who taught\\nboth sides the skills of war – an irony which sharp-tongued Duryodhana\\npoints out in verse 3. Arjuna was Drona’s best pupil when it came to the\\nbow, excelling even Drona’s own son, Ashvatthama.\\nBhishma, “the grandsire” of both sides, is not actually the princes’\\ngrandfather but a respected elder statesman. As Dhritarashtra’s advisor of\\nmany years’ standing, he considers it his duty to stand by his king and try to\\nprotect him from his weaknesses and wrong decisions.\\n\\n\\x0cAnother figure introduced in chapter 1 is Sanjaya, who narrates the entire\\nGita to the blind king Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya is not present on the\\nbattlefield, but the text tells us that the sage Vyasa, the composer of the\\nGita, has given him divine sight so that he can see and report everything.\\nChapter 1 leaves us acutely aware that we are on a battlefield, waiting for\\na catastrophic war to begin; but once Krishna begins his instruction, we\\nleave the battlefield behind and enter the realms of philosophy and mystical\\nvision. The first chapter is but a bridge to the real subjects of the Gita, and\\nthus need not detain us too long in our study of the poem.\\nYet the first chapter has caused a great deal of debate, largely because of\\nwhat it has to say about the morality of war. Basically there have been two\\npoints of view, which are almost (but perhaps not completely)\\nirreconcilable. First, there is the orthodox Hindu viewpoint that the Gita\\ncondones war for the warrior class: it is the dharma, the moral duty, of\\nsoldiers to fight in a good cause, though never for evil leaders. (It should be\\nadded that this is part of an elaborate and highly chivalrous code\\nprescribing the just rules of war.) According to this orthodox view, the\\nlesson of the Mahabharata (and therefore of the Gita) is that although war\\nis evil, it is an evil that cannot be avoided – an evil both tragic and\\nhonorable for the warrior himself. War in a just cause, justly waged, is also\\nin accord with the divine will. Because of this, in the Mahabharata,\\nYudhishthira and his noble brothers find their peace in the next world when\\nthey have finished their duty on earth.\\nThe mystics’ point of view is more subtle. For them the battle is an\\nallegory, a cosmic struggle between good and evil. Krishna has revealed\\nhimself on earth to reestablish righteousness, and he is asking Arjuna to\\nengage in a spiritual struggle, not a worldly one. According to this\\ninterpretation, Arjuna is asked to fight not his kith and kin but his own\\nlower self. Mahatma Gandhi, who based his daily life on the Gita from his\\ntwenties on, felt it would be impossible to live the kind of life taught in the\\nGita and still engage in violence. To argue that the Gita condones violence,\\nhe said, was to give importance only to its opening verses – its preface, so\\nto speak – and ignore the scripture itself.\\nFor some, it helps clarify this question to look upon the Gita as an\\nUpanishad, a mystical statement from the Vedas, that was incorporated into\\nthe warrior epic of a later age. Chapter 1 of the Gita then forms a rather\\n\\n\\x0cperilous bridge between the warrior’s world and the essential part of the\\nGita – Sri Krishna’s revelations of spiritual truth. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c1: The War Within\\nDHRITARASHTRA\\n\\nO Sanjaya, tell me what happened at Kurukshetra, the field of\\ndharma, where my family and the Pandavas gathered to fight.\\n1\\n\\nSANJAYA\\n\\nHaving surveyed the forces of the Pandavas arrayed for battle,\\nprince Duryodhana approached his teacher, Drona, and spoke. 3 “O\\nmy teacher, look at this mighty army of the Pandavas, assembled by\\nyour own gifted disciple, Yudhishthira. 4 There are heroic warriors\\nand great archers who are the equals of Bhima and Arjuna:\\nYuyudhana, Virata, the mighty Drupada, 5 Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana,\\nthe valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja,the great leader\\nShaibya, 6 the powerful Yudhamanyu, the valiant Uttamaujas, and\\nthe son of Subhadra, in addition to the sons of Draupadi. All these\\ncommand mighty chariots.\\n2\\n\\n“O best of brahmins, listen to the names of those who are\\ndistinguished among our own forces: 8 Bhishma, Karna, and the\\nvictorious Kripa; Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta.\\n7\\n\\n“There are many others, too, heroes giving up their lives for my\\nsake, all proficient in war and armed with a variety of weapons. 10\\nOur army is unlimited and commanded by Bhishma; theirs is small\\nand commanded by Bhima. 11 Let everyone take his proper place\\nand stand firm supporting Bhishma!”\\n9\\n\\nThen the powerful Bhishma, the grandsire, oldest of all the\\nKurus, in order to cheer Duryodhana, roared like a lion and blew his\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cconch horn. 13 And after Bhishma, a tremendous noise arose of\\nconchs and cow horns and pounding on drums.\\nThen Sri Krishna and Arjuna, who were standing in a mighty\\nchariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conchs. 15 Sri\\nKrishna blew the conch named Panchajanya, and Arjuna blew that\\ncalled Devadatta. The mighty Bhima blew the huge conch Paundra.\\n16 Yudhishthira, the king, the son of Kunti, blew the conch\\nAnantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conchs as well. 17\\nThen the king of Kashi, the leading bowman, the great warrior\\nShikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the invincible Satyaki, 18\\nDrupada, all the sons of Draupadi, and the strong-armed son of\\nSubhadra joined in, 19 and the noise tore through the heart of\\nDuryodhana’s army. Indeed, the sound was tumultuous, echoing\\nthroughout heaven and earth.\\n14\\n\\nThen, O Dhritarashtra, lord of the earth, having seen your son’s\\nforces set in their places and the fighting about to begin, Arjuna\\nspoke these words to Sri Krishna:\\n20\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, drive my chariot between the two armies. 22 I want to\\nsee those who desire to fight with me. With whom will this battle be\\nfought? 23 I want to see those assembled to fight for Duryodhana,\\nthose who seek to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra by\\nengaging in war.\\n21\\n\\nSANJAYA\\n\\nThus Arjuna spoke, and Sri Krishna, driving his splendid chariot\\nbetween the two armies, 25 facing Bhishma and Drona and all the\\nkings of the earth, said: “Arjuna, behold all the Kurus gathered\\ntogether.”\\n24\\n\\nAnd Arjuna, standing between the two armies, saw fathers and\\ngrandfathers, teachers, uncles, and brothers, sons and grandsons, 27\\nin-laws and friends. Seeing his kinsmen established in opposition, 28\\nArjuna was overcome by sorrow. Despairing, he spoke these words:\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, I see my own relations here anxious to fight, 29 and my\\nlimbs grow weak; my mouth is dry, my body shakes, and my hair is\\nstanding on end. 30 My skin burns, and the bow Gandiva has slipped\\nfrom my hand. I am unable to stand; my mind seems to be whirling.\\n31 These signs bode evil for us. I do not see that any good can come\\nfrom killing our relations in battle. 32 O Krishna, I have no desire\\nfor victory, or for a kingdom or pleasures. Of what use is a kingdom\\nor pleasure or even life, 33 if those for whose sake we desire these\\nthings – 34 teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, in-laws,\\ngrandsons, and others with family ties – are engaging in this battle,\\nrenouncing their wealth and their lives? 35 Even if they were to kill\\nme, I would not want to kill them, not even to become ruler of the\\nthree worlds. How much less for the earth alone?\\nO Krishna, what satisfaction could we find in killing\\nDhritarashtra’s sons? We would become sinners by slaying these\\nmen, even though they are evil. 37 The sons of Dhritarashtra are\\nrelated to us; therefore, we should not kill them. How can we gain\\nhappiness by killing members of our own family?\\n36\\n\\nThough they are overpowered by greed and see no evil in\\ndestroying families or injuring friends, we see these evils. 39 Why\\nshouldn’t we turn away from this sin? 40 When a family declines,\\nancient traditions are destroyed. With them are lost the spiritual\\nfoundations for life, and the family loses its sense of unity. 41 Where\\nthere is no sense of unity, the women of the family become corrupt;\\nand with the corruption of its women, society is plunged into chaos.\\n42 Social chaos is hell for the family and for those who have\\ndestroyed the family as well. It disrupts the process of spiritual\\nevolution begun by our ancestors. 43 The timeless spiritual\\nfoundations of family and society would be destroyed by these\\nterrible deeds, which violate the unity of life.\\n38\\n\\nIt is said that those whose family dharma has been destroyed\\ndwell in hell. 45 This is a great sin! We are prepared to kill our own\\nrelations out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. 46 Better for\\n44\\n\\n\\x0cme if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, were to attack me\\nin battle and kill me unarmed and unresisting.\\nSANJAYA\\n\\nOverwhelmed by sorrow, Arjuna spoke these words. And casting\\naway his bow and his arrows, he sat down in his chariot in the\\nmiddle of the battlefield.\\n47\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Two\\n\\nSelf-Realization\\nAs Arjuna’s spiritual teacher, Sri Krishna’s task now is to rouse Arjuna\\nfrom his despair and set him on the way to Self-realization.\\nArjuna is essentially a man of action, renowned for his bravery, nobility,\\nand skill in the arts of war – intelligent, but not given to reflection. Yet in\\nhis present crisis, he finds that the active life is not enough. He is forced to\\nask the perennial questions about life and death: Does he have a soul? Does\\nit survive death? Is there a deeper reality than we perceive in the world\\naround us? If so, is it possible to know it directly, and (for Arjuna is always\\npractical) what effect does such knowing have in everyday life?\\nIn his answer, Krishna touches on almost all the main themes and\\nconcepts of the Gita. Chapter 2 is thus a kind of overview of the sixteen\\nchapters to come.\\nSri Krishna begins by reminding Arjuna of his immortal nature: his real\\nSelf, the Atman, never dies, for it is never born; it is eternal. Thus the Gita\\ndoes not lead us from stage to stage of spiritual awareness, but begins with\\nthe ultimate premise: the immortal soul is more important than the passing\\nworld.\\nKnowing he is out of his depth in these inner realms of the mind and\\nspirit, Arjuna formally asks Krishna to be his spiritual teacher or guru. This\\nis a basic prerequisite of a disciple’s initiation in the Hindu tradition, where\\nit is believed that virtually all seekers need the guidance of an experienced\\nteacher. Arjuna is no exception, and he is fortunate to have Krishna himself\\nas his guru. In the allegorical sense, Krishna is a symbol of the Atman,\\nArjuna’s deepest Self.\\nThis chapter introduces the idea of rebirth or samsara. The Self wears the\\nbody as a garment; when the garment is old, it is cast aside and a new one is\\nput on. Thus the soul, or jiva, travels from life to life. Just as death is certain\\nfor the living, rebirth is certain for the dead. Krishna assures Arjuna that his\\nbasic nature is not subject to time and death; yet he reminds him that he\\ncannot realize this truth if he cannot see beyond the dualities of life:\\npleasure and pain, success and failure, even heat and cold. The Gita does\\nnot teach a spirituality aimed at an enjoyable life in the hereafter, nor does it\\n\\n\\x0cteach a way to enhance power in this life or the next. It teaches a basic\\ndetachment from pleasure and pain, as this chapter says more than once.\\nOnly in this way can an individual rise above the conditioning of life’s\\ndualities and identify with the Atman, the immortal Self.\\nAlso, the Gita does not teach an enlightenment based on a knowledge of\\nthe scriptures. The important thing is direct mystical experience, which\\nKrishna will later urge Arjuna to acquire for himself.\\nThis chapter establishes the various definitions of yoga taught in the Gita.\\nHere the word does not refer to the physical postures and exercises (hatha\\nyoga) it connotes in the West; it refers primarily to disciplining the mind.\\n“Yoga is evenness of mind”: detachment from the dualities of pain and\\npleasure, success and failure. Therefore “yoga is skill in action,” because\\nthis kind of detachment is required if one is to act in freedom, rather than\\nmerely react to events compelled by conditioning. Krishna is not trying to\\npersuade Arjuna to lead a different kind of life and renounce the world as\\nwould a monk or recluse. He tells Arjuna that if he can establish himself in\\nyoga – in unshakable equanimity, profound peace of mind – he will be more\\neffective in the realm of action. His judgment will be better and his vision\\nclear if he is not emotionally entangled in the outcome of what he does.\\nArjuna now asks his first question as Krishna’s student. His teacher has\\nbeen talking about spiritual wisdom: direct, experiential knowledge of the\\nimmortal Self. Arjuna wants to know what difference this kind of wisdom\\nmakes in everyday life. If a person establishes an ever-present awareness of\\nthe core of divinity within himself, how does it affect the way he lives?\\nArjuna is not interested in what people believe, but in how they conduct\\nthemselves in life.\\nKrishna’s answer (2:55 –72 ) is one of the most quoted passages in the\\nGita. Mahatma Gandhi said these verses contain the essence of the Gita: if\\nthe rest of the scripture were lost, this passage alone would be enough to\\nteach a complete way of life. Those who are established in wisdom (sthitaprajna) live in continuous, unbroken awareness that they are not the\\nperishable body but the Atman. Further, they see the same Self in everyone,\\nfor the Atman is universally present in all.\\nSuch a one, Krishna says, does not identify with personal desires. These\\ndesires are on the surface of personality, and the Self is its very core. The\\nSelf-realized man or woman is not motivated by personal desires – in other\\nwords, by any desire for kama, personal satisfaction. This idea is perhaps\\n\\n\\x0cforeign to modern ways of thinking, but basic to the Gita – and, indeed, to\\nmystics of all traditions.\\nMore specifically, the word kama refers to any gratification of the ego or\\nthe senses that entangles us in the world of samsara, and thus draws us\\naway from the core of our being, the Self. Those established in Selfrealization control their senses instead of letting their senses control them.\\nIf the senses are not controlled, Krishna warns, the mind (or emotions) will\\nfollow wherever they lead. Eventually a person following the senses loses\\nstrength of will and unity of purpose; his choices are dictated by his desires.\\nWhen the will is led astray by the desire for pleasure, the mind becomes\\nconfused and scattered. Ultimately, Krishna warns, this leads to spiritual\\ndestruction:\\nWhen you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes.\\nAttachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger.\\nAnger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes.\\nLost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise,\\nand your life is utter waste. (2:62 –63 )\\nYet the Gita does not recommend asceticism. It is more a matter of\\ntraining the body, mind, and senses.\\nAt the very close of the chapter, Krishna introduces the idea that it is not\\nenough to master all selfish desires; it is also necessary to subdue\\npossessiveness and egocentricity. If this ultimate bourne can be passed, then\\nthe seeker will know the true, immortal Self within. This is the mystics’\\nsupreme goal: knowing their real nature, they know their own immortality\\nand realize their union with eternal Being. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c2: Self-Realization\\nSANJAYA\\n\\nThese are the words that Sri Krishna spoke to the despairing\\nArjuna, whose eyes were burning with tears of pity and confusion.\\n1\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nThis despair and weakness in a time of crisis are mean and\\nunworthy of you, Arjuna. How have you fallen into a state so far\\nfrom the path to liberation? 3 It does not become you to yield to this\\nweakness. Arise with a brave heart and destroy the enemy.\\n2\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nHow can I ever bring myself to fight against Bhishma and Drona,\\nwho are worthy of reverence? How can I, Krishna? 5 Surely it\\nwould be better to spend my life begging than to kill these great and\\nworthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would be\\ntainted. 6 I don’t even know which would be better, for us to\\nconquer them or for them to conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashtra\\nhave confronted us; but why would we care to live if we killed\\nthem?\\n4\\n\\nMy will is paralyzed, and I am utterly confused. Tell me which is\\nthe better path for me. Let me be your disciple. I have fallen at your\\nfeet; give me instruction. 8 What can overcome a sorrow that saps\\nall my vitality? Even power over men and gods or the wealth of an\\nempire seem empty.\\n7\\n\\nSANJAYA\\n\\n\\x0cThis is how Arjuna, the great warrior, spoke to Sri Krishna. With\\nthe words, “O Krishna, I will not fight,” he fell silent. 10 As they\\nstood between the two armies, Sri Krishna smiled and replied to\\nArjuna, who had sunk into despair.\\n9\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nYou speak sincerely, but your sorrow has no cause. The wise\\ngrieve neither for the living nor for the dead. 12 There has never\\nbeen a time when you and I and the kings gathered here have not\\nexisted, nor will there be a time when we will cease to exist. 13 As\\nthe same person inhabits the body through childhood, youth, and old\\nage, so too at the time of death he attains another body. The wise are\\nnot deluded by these changes.\\n11\\n\\nWhen the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold\\nor heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come\\nand go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. 15 Those who are unaffected by\\nthese changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise\\nand fit for immortality. Assert your strength and realize this!\\n14\\n\\nThe impermanent has no reality; reality lies in the eternal. Those\\nwho have seen the boundary between these two have attained the\\nend of all knowledge. 17 Realize that which pervades the universe\\nand is indestructible; no power can affect this unchanging,\\nimperishable reality. 18 The body is mortal, but that which dwells in\\nthe body is immortal and immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, fight in\\nthis battle.\\n16\\n\\nOne believes he is the slayer, another believes he is the slain.\\nBoth are ignorant; there is neither slayer nor slain. 20 You were\\nnever born; you will never die. You have never changed; you can\\nnever change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, you do not\\ndie when the body dies. 21 Realizing that which is indestructible,\\neternal, unborn, and unchanging, how can you slay or cause another\\nto slay?\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cAs one abandons worn-out clothes and acquires new ones, so\\nwhen the body is worn out a new one is acquired by the Self, who\\nlives within.\\n22\\n\\nThe Self cannot be pierced by weapons or burned by fire; water\\ncannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it. 24 The Self cannot be pierced\\nor burned, made wet or dry. It is everlasting and infinite, standing on\\nthe motionless foundations of eternity. 25 The Self is unmanifested,\\nbeyond all thought, beyond all change. Knowing this, you should\\nnot grieve.\\n23\\n\\nO mighty Arjuna, even if you believe the Self to be subject to\\nbirth and death, you should not grieve. 27 Death is inevitable for the\\nliving; birth is inevitable for the dead. Since these are unavoidable,\\nyou should not sorrow. 28 Every creature is unmanifested at first and\\nthen attains manifestation. When its end has come, it once again\\nbecomes unmanifested. What is there to lament in this?\\n26\\n\\nThe glory of the Self is beheld by a few, and a few describe it; a\\nfew listen, but many without understanding. 30 The Self of all\\nbeings, living within the body, is eternal and cannot be harmed.\\nTherefore, do not grieve.\\n29\\n\\nConsidering your dharma, you should not vacillate. For a warrior,\\nnothing is higher than a war against evil. 32 The warrior confronted\\nwith such a war should be pleased, Arjuna, for it comes as an open\\ngate to heaven. 33 But if you do not participate in this battle against\\nevil, you will incur sin, violating your dharma and your honor.\\n31\\n\\nThe story of your dishonor will be repeated endlessly: and for a\\nman of honor, dishonor is worse than death. 35 These brave warriors\\nwill think you have withdrawn from battle out of fear, and those\\nwho formerly esteemed you will treat you with disrespect. 36 Your\\nenemies will ridicule your strength and say things that should not be\\nsaid. What could be more painful than this?\\n34\\n\\nDeath means the attainment of heaven; victory means the\\nenjoyment of the earth. Therefore rise up, Arjuna, resolved to fight!\\n37\\n\\n\\x0cHaving made yourself alike in pain and pleasure, profit and loss,\\nvictory and defeat, engage in this great battle and you will be freed\\nfrom sin.\\n38\\n\\nYou have heard the intellectual explanation of Sankhya, Arjuna;\\nnow listen to the principles of yoga. By practicing these you can\\nbreak through the bonds of karma. 40 On this path effort never goes\\nto waste, and there is no failure. Even a little effort toward spiritual\\nawareness will protect you from the greatest fear.\\n39\\n\\nThose who follow this path, resolving deep within themselves to\\nseek me alone, attain singleness of purpose. For those who lack\\nresolution, the decisions of life are many-branched and endless.\\n41\\n\\nThere are ignorant people who speak flowery words and take\\ndelight in the letter of the law, saying that there is nothing else. 43\\nTheir hearts are full of selfish desires, Arjuna. Their idea of heaven\\nis their own enjoyment, and the aim of all their activities is pleasure\\nand power. The fruit of their actions is continual rebirth. 44 Those\\nwhose minds are swept away by the pursuit of pleasure and power\\nare incapable of following the supreme goal and will not attain\\nsamadhi.\\n42\\n\\nThe scriptures describe the three gunas. But you should be free\\nfrom the action of the gunas, established in eternal truth, selfcontrolled, without any sense of duality or the desire to acquire and\\nhoard.\\n45\\n\\nJust as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is\\nflooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined man or woman,\\nwho sees the Lord everywhere.\\n46\\n\\nYou have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You\\nshould never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you\\nlong for inaction. 48 Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man\\nestablished within himself – without selfish attachments, and alike\\nin success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind.\\n47\\n\\n\\x0cSeek refuge in the attitude of detachment and you will amass the\\nwealth of spiritual awareness. Those who are motivated only by\\ndesire for the fruits of action are miserable, for they are constantly\\nanxious about the results of what they do. 50 When consciousness is\\nunified, however, all vain anxiety is left behind. There is no cause\\nfor worry, whether things go well or ill. Therefore, devote yourself\\nto the disciplines of yoga, for yoga is skill in action.\\n49\\n\\nThe wise unify their consciousness and abandon attachment to the\\nfruits of action, which binds a person to continual rebirth. Thus they\\nattain a state beyond all evil.\\n51\\n\\nWhen your mind has overcome the confusion of duality, you will\\nattain the state of holy indifference to things you hear and things\\nyou have heard. 53 When you are unmoved by the confusion of\\nideas and your mind is completely united in deep samadhi, you will\\nattain the state of perfect yoga.\\n52\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nTell me of those who live established in wisdom, ever aware of\\nthe Self, O Krishna. How do they talk? How sit? How move about?\\n54\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nThey live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them,\\nwho have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving\\ntormenting the heart.\\n55\\n\\nNeither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live\\nfree from lust and fear and anger. Established in meditation, they are\\ntruly wise. 57 Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are\\nneither elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. Such are the\\nseers.\\n56\\n\\nEven as a tortoise draws in its limbs, the wise can draw in their\\nsenses at will. 59 Aspirants abstain from sense pleasures, but they\\nstill crave for them. These cravings all disappear when they see the\\nhighest goal. 60 Even of those who tread the path, the stormy senses\\n58\\n\\n\\x0ccan sweep off the mind. 61 They live in wisdom who subdue their\\nsenses and keep their minds ever absorbed in me.\\nWhen you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes.\\nAttachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger.\\n63 Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past\\nmistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and\\nwhat is unwise, and your life is utter waste. 64 But when you move\\namidst the world of sense, free from attachment and aversion alike,\\n65 there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you live in\\nthe wisdom of the Self.\\n62\\n\\nThe disunited mind is far from wise; how can it meditate? How\\nbe at peace? When you know no peace, how can you know joy? 67\\nWhen you let your mind follow the call of the senses, they carry\\naway your better judgment as storms drive a boat off its charted\\ncourse on the sea.\\n66\\n\\nUse all your power to free the senses from attachment and\\naversion alike, and live in the full wisdom of the Self. 69 Such a sage\\nawakes to light in the night of all creatures. That which the world\\ncalls day is the night of ignorance to the wise.\\n68\\n\\nAs rivers flow into the ocean but cannot make the vast ocean\\noverflow, so flow the streams of the sense-world into the sea of\\npeace that is the sage. But this is not so with the desirer of desires.\\n70\\n\\nThey are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break\\naway from the ego-cage of “I,” “me,” and “mine” to be united with\\nthe Lord. 72 This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from\\ndeath to immortality.\\n71\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Three\\n\\nSelfless Service\\nThe title of this chapter in Sanskrit is Karma Yoga, “The Way of Action,”\\nand here we take an apparently sharp turn away from the subject of the\\nprevious chapter. In fact, Arjuna changes the subject completely. Krishna\\nhas been trying to convince him that he has an immortal soul, but Arjuna\\ncontinues to worry about his immediate predicament. It is not that he is\\nuninterested in mystical enlightenment, but his main concern at the moment\\nis just what he is supposed to do next.\\nOr, he asks, perhaps what he does is not so important after all. Has\\nKrishna been telling him to concentrate on acquiring spiritual wisdom and\\nto forget about his apparent duties in the world?\\nKrishna replies that there is no way Arjuna can avoid the obligation of\\nselfless action, or karma yoga. Arjuna must act selflessly, out of a sense of\\nduty. He must work not for his own sake, but for the welfare of all. Krishna\\npoints out that this is a basic law underlying all creation. Each being must\\ndo its part in the grand scheme of things, and there is no way to avoid this\\nobligation – except perhaps by the complete enlightenment which loosens\\nall the old bonds of karma.\\nHere the Gita refers to the doctrine of karma, one of the basic teachings\\nin all Hindu and Buddhist scriptures. Karma literally means deed or action;\\nwhat is sometimes called the “law of karma” refers to an underlying law of\\ncause and effect that is seen to permeate all existence. The idea is that every\\naction leads to a reasonable result – and, consequently, that everything that\\nhappens can be traced to something done in the past. Actions determine\\ndestiny: this is the basic idea of karma. If anything happens to us that is\\ntruly good, we must have done something in the past to deserve it; if\\nsomething ill befalls us, then at some time in the past we did something that\\nwas not so meritorious. This is a basic moral law that all great spiritual\\ntraditions share: the belief that we reap what we sow.\\nThe Hindu tradition gave a great deal of thought to this problem of moral\\ncause and effect, and generation after generation of spiritual teachers\\nfathomed its depths and implications. One fear that developed over time\\nwas that all action was in a sense an open door to bondage: anything a\\n\\n\\x0cperson did would bind him to the endless cycle of cause and effect. Some\\n“fruits” of action would of course be pleasant – not all karma is painful. But\\neven this pleasure could be a trap, because we would seek it compulsively,\\ntying ourselves tighter and tighter to the responsibilities and opportunities\\nof the worldly life and forgetting our spiritual dimension altogether.\\nIn chapter 3 Krishna begins to tell Arjuna the way out of this maze of\\ncause and effect. It is not to avoid work, especially the duties required by\\nhis station in life, but to perform those duties without selfish attachment to\\ntheir “fruit,” or outcome. If Arjuna follows this path of selfless work,\\nKrishna explains, he will enjoy this world as well as the next. More\\nimportant, he will gain a spiritual blessing and will be lessening his debt of\\nkarma. Only when he is free from every bond of karma – every\\nconsequence of past action – can he achieve life’s ultimate goal.\\nThe world is bound in its own activity, for all creatures except the\\nillumined man or woman work for their own pleasure and gain. Because\\nthey act selfishly, they are bound by the results, whether good or bad. We\\nmust act in a selfless spirit, Krishna says, without ego-involvement and\\nwithout getting entangled in whether things work out the way we want;\\nonly then will we not fall into the terrible net of karma. We cannot hope to\\nescape karma by refraining from our duties: even to survive in the world,\\nwe must act.\\nTrue, the Hindu scriptures do hold out another path – jnana yoga, the\\npath of wisdom – which does not enjoin action. But Krishna does not really\\noffer this to Arjuna as an alternative; it is acknowledged and then dropped.\\nPerhaps Krishna knows that Arjuna is not the type to disengage himself and\\ngo off on a search for the mystical vision. For Arjuna, the active life is\\nessential.\\nThe danger, of course, of a life of active engagement in the world is that\\nArjuna will get caught up in his actions and begin to act out of selfish\\nmotives. If this were to happen, he would be doomed to spiritual failure.\\nHaving a good deal of self-knowledge, Arjuna senses this danger. He\\nasks Krishna a fundamental question: What power binds us to our selfish\\nways? Even if we wish to act rightly, so often we do the wrong thing. What\\npower moves us?\\nKrishna replies that anger and selfish desire are our greatest enemies.\\nThey are the destructive powers that can compel us to wander away from\\nour purpose, to end up in self-delusion and despair.\\n\\n\\x0cHere it is necessary to introduce two technical terms from Hindu\\nphilosophy. The Gita is not an academic work of philosophy, but a poetic,\\npractical text. Still, it does refer from time to time to Sankhya, one of the\\nsix traditional schools of Indian philosophy. In Sankhya, the phenomenal\\nworld of mind and matter is described as having three basic qualities or\\ngunas: sattva– goodness, light, purity; rajas– passion, activity, energy; and\\ntamas– darkness, ignorance, inertia. According to Sankhya, spiritual\\nevolution progresses from tamas to rajas to sattva, and final liberation takes\\nthe soul beyond the three gunas altogether.\\nHere Krishna warns Arjuna to beware the pitfalls of rajas, for it is from\\nrajas that anger and selfish desire arise. Arjuna must realize that his true\\nnature, the Atman, is above entanglement in the gunas. The gunas act and\\nreact upon one another, but Arjuna’s inner being is not affected. If he cannot\\nreach this detachment, he will be always caught in the emotional storms of\\npassion (rajas) or the quagmires of inertia (tamas) which alternate in\\ndominating the mind and body.\\nKrishna offers Arjuna the example of King Janaka, well known from\\nholy legend, as a model for the princely estate. Janaka was a king who ruled\\nwell and did not shirk his responsibilities, yet he was detached and worked\\nfrom a sense of duty, not for personal gain or enjoyment. He was revered as\\na royal sage who pursued his enlightenment not by renouncing the world,\\nbut by working in it and contributing to its welfare, thus enjoying the best\\nof both worlds. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c3: Selfless Service\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, you have said that knowledge is greater than action;\\nwhy then do you ask me to wage this terrible war? 2 Your advice\\nseems inconsistent. Give me one path to follow to the supreme\\ngood.\\n1\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nAt the beginning of time I declared two paths for the pure heart:\\njnana yoga, the contemplative path of spiritual wisdom, and karma\\nyoga, the active path of selfless service.\\n3\\n\\nOne who shirks action does not attain freedom; no one can gain\\nperfection by abstaining from work. 5 Indeed, there is no one who\\nrests for even an instant; all creatures are driven to action by their\\nown nature.\\n4\\n\\nThose who abstain from action while allowing the mind to dwell\\non sensual pleasure cannot be called sincere spiritual aspirants. 7\\nBut they excel who control their senses through the mind, using\\nthem for selfless service.\\n6\\n\\nFulfill all your duties; action is better than inaction. Even to\\nmaintain your body, Arjuna, you are obliged to act. 9 Selfish action\\nimprisons the world. Act selflessly, without any thought of personal\\nprofit.\\n8\\n\\nAt the beginning, mankind and the obligation of selfless service\\nwere created together. “Through selfless service, you will always be\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cfruitful and find the fulfillment of your desires”: this is the promise\\nof the Creator.\\nHonor and cherish the devas as they honor and cherish you;\\nthrough this honor and love you will attain the supreme good. 12 All\\nhuman desires are fulfilled by the devas, who are pleased by selfless\\nservice. But anyone who enjoys the things given by the devas\\nwithout offering selfless acts in return is a thief.\\n11\\n\\nThe spiritually minded, who eat in the spirit of service, are freed\\nfrom all their sins; but the selfish, who prepare food for their own\\nsatisfaction, eat sin. 14 Living creatures are nourished by food, and\\nfood is nourished by rain; rain itself is the water of life, which\\ncomes from selfless worship and service.\\n13\\n\\nEvery selfless act, Arjuna, is born from Brahman, the eternal,\\ninfinite Godhead. Brahman is present in every act of service. 16 All\\nlife turns on this law, O Arjuna. Those who violate it, indulging the\\nsenses for their own pleasure and ignoring the needs of others, have\\nwasted their life. 17 But those who realize the Self are always\\nsatisfied. Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no\\nlonger seek happiness from the external world. 18 They have\\nnothing to gain or lose by any action; neither people nor things can\\naffect their security.\\n15\\n\\nStrive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to\\nselfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. 20 Do your work\\nwith the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that\\nJanaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path.\\n19\\n\\nWhat the outstanding person does, others will try to do. The\\nstandards such people create will be followed by the whole world. 22\\nThere is nothing in the three worlds for me to gain, Arjuna, nor is\\nthere anything I do not have; I continue to act, but I am not driven\\nby any need of my own. 23 If I ever refrained from continuous work,\\neveryone would immediately follow my example. 24 If I stopped\\nworking I would be the cause of cosmic chaos, and finally of the\\ndestruction of this world and these people.\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cThe ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for\\nthe welfare of the world, without thought for themselves. 26 By\\nabstaining from work you will confuse the ignorant, who are\\nengrossed in their actions. Perform all work carefully, guided by\\ncompassion.\\n25\\n\\nAll actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti. Deluded by\\nidentification with the ego, a person thinks, “I am the doer.” 28 But\\nthe illumined man or woman understands the domain of the gunas\\nand is not attached. Such people know that the gunas interact with\\neach other; they do not claim to be the doer.\\n27\\n\\nThose who are deluded by the operation of the gunas become\\nattached to the results of their action. Those who understand these\\ntruths should not unsettle the ignorant. 30 Performing all actions for\\nmy sake, completely absorbed in the Self, and without expectations,\\nfight! – but stay free from the fever of the ego.\\n29\\n\\nThose who live in accordance with these divine laws without\\ncomplaining, firmly established in faith, are released from karma. 32\\nThose who violate these laws, criticizing and complaining, are\\nutterly deluded, and are the cause of their own suffering.\\n31\\n\\nEven the wise act within the limitations of their own nature.\\nEvery creature is subject to prakriti; what is the use of repression? 34\\nThe senses have been conditioned by attraction to the pleasant and\\naversion to the unpleasant. Do not be ruled by them; they are\\nobstacles in your path.\\n33\\n\\nIt is better to strive in one’s own dharma than to succeed in the\\ndharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following one’s own\\ndharma, but competition in another’s dharma breeds fear and\\ninsecurity.\\n35\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nWhat is the force that binds us to selfish deeds, O Krishna? What\\npower moves us, even against our will, as if forcing us?\\n36\\n\\n\\x0cKRISHNA\\n\\nIt is selfish desire and anger, arising from the guna of rajas; these\\nare the appetites and evils which threaten a person in this life.\\n37\\n\\nJust as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by\\ndust, just as the embryo rests deep within the womb, knowledge is\\nhidden by selfish desire – 39 hidden, Arjuna, by this unquenchable\\nfire for self-satisfaction, the inveterate enemy of the wise.\\n38\\n\\nSelfish desire is found in the senses, mind, and intellect,\\nmisleading them and burying the understanding in delusion. 41 Fight\\nwith all your strength, Arjuna! Controlling your senses, conquer\\nyour enemy, the destroyer of knowledge and realization.\\n40\\n\\nThe senses are higher than the body, the mind higher than the\\nsenses; above the mind is the intellect, and above the intellect is the\\nAtman. 43 Thus, knowing that which is supreme, let the Atman rule\\nthe ego. Use your mighty arms to slay the fierce enemy that is\\nselfish desire.\\n42\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Four\\n\\nWisdom in Action\\nKrishna is eager to grant Arjuna knowledge of the highest spiritual truths,\\nor even a rare mystical vision; but Arjuna has been asking for Krishna to\\nsimply get him out of his present difficulties. Of course these difficulties are\\nnot minor – he is caught in a family tragedy that has developed into a\\nvicious conflict. If he cannot extricate himself, he knows that he will have\\nto take part in a catastrophic battle that no one wants.\\nSo when Krishna begins to tell Arjuna about the “secret teachings” he\\nwill be privileged to hear because he is Krishna’s favorite devotee and\\nfriend, it hardly registers in Arjuna’s consciousness. His reply is confused.\\n“How could you have taught any secret wisdom to the sages of old?” he\\nasks.\\nAt this point Krishna reminds Arjuna again of the process of rebirth.\\nThey have both been reborn many times, but naturally Arjuna does not\\nremember his past lives because he has no access to this kind of knowledge.\\nKrishna remembers his former births, but he is no ordinary being. He\\nreveals that he has chosen to take on human birth many times for the\\nwelfare of the world. Whenever dharma, the law of life’s unity, declines, he\\nwraps himself in his maya and takes on a finite form. Thus he returns age\\nafter age.\\nVishnu, the preserving or sustaining person of the Hindu Trinity, is not\\nmentioned here, but Krishna is usually looked upon as an incarnation of this\\naspect of God. As the Lord, Krishna explains, he dwells in every being, but\\nhe is manifested with special power in his incarnations or avatars. Avatara\\nliterally means descent: Vishnu is believed to descend and incarnate himself\\non earth from age to age to reestablish divine law (dharma). Without such\\nintervention the entire created universe would go into decline. The natural\\ncourse of creation is to go through cycles of regeneration and decay, but\\nVishnu – Krishna – has compassion for all the suffering of the world, and\\ncomes himself to protect the good and destroy evil. Thus Vishnu has a\\nspecial relationship with all beings: he personifies the aspect of God who so\\nloves the world that he comes into it to reestablish the purity and happiness\\nof the Golden Age.\\n\\n\\x0cKrishna here reveals a little of his hidden, divine nature. He tells Arjuna\\nthat mystical union with him is possible through devotion, by which one\\ncan enter the state of divine love in which one sees God in every creature.\\nKrishna also takes on the role of creator. It is he who has patterned the\\nworld along the lines of guna and karma.\\nThis mystic aspect of Krishna’s being dominates the Gita. In the\\nMahabharata, Krishna is a princely ally who is wise and daring in his\\nsupport of his friend Arjuna. But the author of the Gita is not concerned\\nwith this Krishna; he turns his attention to the mystery of Krishna’s divine\\nnature as an aspect of Vishnu. In this sense Krishna is the inner Self in all\\nbeings. His name comes from the Sanskrit root krish, “to draw to oneself, to\\nattract.” He is the “attractive one,” the “Lord of loving attraction.” By\\nanother etymology, the word Krishna means “the dark one.” The author of\\nthe Gita sees revealed in him the ultimate Godhead, the supreme being. But\\nthis reality is often veiled, and then Krishna is seen as an ordinary human\\nbeing – or, rather, as an exceptionally gifted man, but not as God.\\nMany of Krishna’s words make most sense when we realize that when he\\nspeaks of himself, he is often not describing a transcendental reality so\\nmuch as trying to tell Arjuna about the Self in every human being. When he\\nsays, for example, “Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to\\ntheir results,” he means, “Arjuna, actions do not cling to your real Self.”\\nThe Self in us is not touched by action; whatever we do, it remains\\nunsullied. “Those who understand this” – about themselves – “and practice\\nit live in freedom.”\\nThe latter part of this chapter turns from lofty mystical topics back to\\nArjuna’s immediate problem. Krishna begins to talk about action, and work,\\nand things that should be done and should not be done. It is essential, he\\nreminds Arjuna, to act wisely, with detachment. The wise never act with\\nselfish attachment to the fruit of their labor; they give their best in fortune\\nand misfortune alike. Such people act in freedom.\\nThe next section deals with the various kinds of yajna – worship or\\noffering – that may be performed by spiritual aspirants of differing\\ntemperaments. Hindu rituals often involve making an offering to the gods\\nby pouring an oblation into the sacred fire. Here the image is the same:\\nwhatever is offered is symbolically thrown into a consuming fire that\\ncarries the offering to God. The offering may be as obvious as worldly\\ngoods, or as subtle as knowledge or meditation: in any case it requires a\\n\\n\\x0cmeasure of self-sacrifice. Yajna is a basic action, necessary to life, and those\\nwho do not perform some kind of selfless service find no home in this\\nworld or the next.\\nThe final verses of chapter 4 introduce a new principle. In the last\\nchapter, Krishna mentioned the path of spiritual wisdom as an alternative to\\nthe path of action or karma yoga. Now he reveals that wisdom is the goal of\\nselfless action: knowing is the fruit of doing. The goal of all karma yoga or\\nyajna is liberation and spiritual wisdom. The fire of spiritual awareness\\nburns to ashes even a great heap of karma; thus true knowledge is the\\ngreatest purifier of the soul.\\nKrishna ends by exhorting Arjuna to cut through the doubts that still\\nstifle him. This is the first – but not the last – mention that Krishna makes\\nof Arjuna’s doubting heart. There has been no indication so far that Arjuna\\nhas taken in and accepted Krishna’s words. But even though Arjuna\\ncontinues to drag his feet, Krishna does not abandon him. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c4: Wisdom in Action\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nI told this eternal secret to Vivasvat. Vivasvat taught Manu, and\\nManu taught Ikshvaku. 2 Thus, Arjuna, eminent sages received\\nknowledge of yoga in a continuous tradition. But through time the\\npractice of yoga was lost in the world.\\n1\\n\\nThe secret of these teachings is profound. I have explained them to\\nyou today because you are my friend and devotee.\\n3\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nYou were born much after Vivasvat; he lived very long ago. Why\\ndo you say that you taught this yoga in the beginning?\\n4\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nYou and I have passed through many births, Arjuna. You have\\nforgotten, but I remember them all.\\n5\\n\\nMy true being is unborn and changeless. I am the Lord who dwells\\nin every creature. Through the power of my own maya, I manifest\\nmyself in a finite form.\\n6\\n\\nWhenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I\\nmanifest myself on earth. 8 I am born in every age to protect the\\ngood, to destroy evil, and to reestablish dharma.\\n7\\n\\nThose who know me as their own divine Self break through the\\nbelief that they are the body and are not reborn as separate creatures.\\nSuch a one, Arjuna, is united with me. 10 Delivered from selfish\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cattachment, fear, and anger, filled with me, surrendering themselves\\nto me, purified in the fire of my being, many have reached the state\\nof unity in me.\\nAs they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to\\nme.\\n11\\n\\nThose desiring success in their actions worship the gods; through\\naction in the world of mortals, their desires are quickly fulfilled. 13\\nThe distinctions of caste, guna, and karma have come from me. I am\\ntheir cause, but I myself am changeless and beyond all action. 14\\nActions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results.\\nThose who understand this and practice it live in freedom. 15\\nKnowing this truth, aspirants desiring liberation in ancient times\\nengaged in action. You too can do the same, pursuing an active life\\nin the manner of those ancient sages.\\n12\\n\\nWhat is action and what is inaction? This question has confused\\nthe greatest sages. I will give you the secret of action, with which\\nyou can free yourself from bondage. 17 The true nature of action is\\ndifficult to grasp. You must understand what is action and what is\\ninaction, and what kind of action should be avoided.\\n16\\n\\nThe wise see that there is action in the midst of inaction and\\ninaction in the midst of action. Their consciousness is unified, and\\nevery act is done with complete awareness.\\n18\\n\\nThe awakened sages call a person wise when all his undertakings\\nare free from anxiety about results; all his selfish desires have been\\nconsumed in the fire of knowledge. 20 The wise, ever satisfied, have\\nabandoned all external supports. Their security is unaffected by the\\nresults of their action; even while acting, they really do nothing at\\nall. 21 Free from expectations and from all sense of possession, with\\nmind and body firmly controlled by the Self, they do not incur sin\\nby the performance of physical action.\\n19\\n\\nThey live in freedom who have gone beyond the dualities of life.\\nCompeting with no one, they are alike in success and failure and\\n22\\n\\n\\x0ccontent with whatever comes to them. 23 They are free, without\\nselfish attachments; their minds are fixed in knowledge. They\\nperform all work in the spirit of service, and their karma is\\ndissolved.\\nThe process of offering is Brahman; that which is offered is\\nBrahman. Brahman offers the sacrifice in the fire of Brahman.\\nBrahman is attained by those who see Brahman in every action.\\n24\\n\\nSome aspirants offer material sacrifices to the gods. Others offer\\nselfless service as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. 26 Some\\nrenounce all enjoyment of the senses, sacrificing them in the fire of\\nsense restraint. Others partake of sense objects but offer them in\\nservice through the fire of the senses. 27 Some offer the workings of\\nthe senses and the vital forces through the fire of self-control,\\nkindled in the path of knowledge.\\n25\\n\\nSome offer wealth; others offer sense restraint and suffering.\\nSome take vows and offer knowledge and study of the scriptures;\\nand some make the offering of meditation. 29 Some offer the forces\\nof vitality, regulating their inhalation and exhalation, and thus gain\\ncontrol over these forces. 30 Others offer the forces of vitality\\nthrough restraint of their senses. All these understand the meaning\\nof service and will be cleansed of their impurities.\\n28\\n\\nTrue sustenance is in service, and through it a man or woman\\nreaches the eternal Brahman. But those who do not seek to serve are\\nwithout a home in this world. Arjuna, how can they be at home in\\nany world to come?\\n31\\n\\nThese offerings are born of work, and each guides mankind along\\na path to Brahman. Understanding this, you will attain liberation. 33\\nThe offering of wisdom is better than any material offering, Arjuna;\\nfor the goal of all work is spiritual wisdom.\\n32\\n\\nApproach those who have realized the purpose of life and\\nquestion them with reverence and devotion; they will instruct you in\\n34\\n\\n\\x0cthis wisdom. 35 Once you attain it, you will never again be deluded.\\nYou will see all creatures in the Self, and all in me.\\nEven if you were the most sinful of sinners, Arjuna, you could\\ncross beyond all sin by the raft of spiritual wisdom. 37 As the heat of\\na fire reduces wood to ashes, the fire of knowledge burns to ashes\\nall karma. 38 Nothing in this world purifies like spiritual wisdom. It\\nis the perfection achieved in time through the path of yoga, the path\\nwhich leads to the Self within.\\n36\\n\\nThose who take wisdom as their highest goal, whose faith is deep\\nand whose senses are trained, attain wisdom quickly and enter into\\nperfect peace. 40 But the ignorant, indecisive and lacking in faith,\\nwaste their lives. They can never be happy in this world or any\\nother.\\n39\\n\\nThose established in the Self have renounced selfish attachments\\nto their actions and cut through doubts with spiritual wisdom. They\\nact in freedom. 42 Arjuna, cut through this doubt in your own heart\\nwith the sword of spiritual wisdom. Arise; take up the path of yoga!\\n41\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Five\\n\\nRenounce & Rejoice\\nAt the beginning of this chapter, the traditional approach to the spiritual life\\n– that is, “leaving the world,” retiring from the ordinary affairs of job and\\nfamily – is contrasted with working in the world with detachment. The\\ngeneral term for retiring from the world is sannyasa, “renunciation.”\\nTraditionally, sannyasa meant renouncing all worldly ties and attachments.\\nThe person undertaking the vow of sannyasa would leave home, family, and\\noccupation to pursue a strict contemplative life.\\nThis was a path chosen by very few, even in ancient India. Yet we\\nshouldn’t forget that surprising numbers of people in traditional societies,\\nboth in the East and the West, have chosen a monastic life removed from\\nthe turmoil of the world. In India, the Compassionate Buddha provides the\\nclassic example of one who leaves the comforts and fulfillments of family\\nand worldly life to seek the lonely way to Self-realization. The story is well\\nknown throughout Asia. Siddhartha Gautama was a prince with every\\nworldly satisfaction within his reach, who left his palace to find a way to\\nlead the world beyond suffering and death. He became a wandering\\nsannyasi, a lonely, austere monk. Only after he had attained to complete\\nenlightenment did he return to society, to teach others of the peace of\\nnirvana.\\nThough Krishna acknowledges here that this way of sannyasa can lead to\\nthe goal, he recommends the path of selfless action or selfless service as the\\nbetter way. He contrasts the way of Sankhya – which in this context means\\nknowledge of the Self in a general way – to the way of yoga, which here\\nmeans the way of action. This term yoga presents difficulties in the Gita\\nbecause it means different things at different times, and many definitions\\nare given of this all-purpose term. But for several chapters the topic under\\ndiscussion has been the active spiritual life, or karma yoga, and that is\\nclearly what is meant in this context. Sankhya and yoga might also be\\ntranslated as “theory and practice.”\\nIt would seem that at the time of the Gita the path of wisdom was\\nregarded very highly, while the path of action may have been looked upon\\nas an adulteration of the spiritual life. It is even possible that the Gita was\\n\\n\\x0cthe first Hindu scripture to introduce the novel idea of combining karma\\nyoga with the pursuit of Self-knowledge. Krishna says that only immature,\\ninexperienced people look upon the paths of knowledge and action as\\ndifferent. The true goal of action is knowledge of the Self. Following either\\npath faithfully will lead to the complete spiritual vision.\\nIt is essential in karma yoga that the selfish ego not expect gratification\\nfrom the work. When there is no selfish involvement in work, the worker\\ndoes not come to spiritual harm. The example is the lotus: it spends its life\\nfloating in water, yet the drops of water roll off its leaves without ever\\nwetting them. Similarly, as long as the karma yogis do not expect reward or\\nrecognition, any evil that might stain them has nowhere to cling. Such yogis\\nare said to be detached from the outcome or fruits of their actions (karma\\nphala).\\nKrishna warns Arjuna that a life of work, even successful work, cannot\\nbe fulfilling without Self-knowledge. Ultimately, the true Self within him is\\nnot affected by what he does, whether good or bad. Only knowledge of the\\nSelf, which rises like the sun at dawn, can fulfill the purpose of his life and\\nlead him beyond rebirth.\\nThis knowledge of the Self or Atman is, by its very nature, also\\nknowledge of Brahman, the all-pervading, immanent and transcendent\\nGodhead. Krishna says that the illumined person sees this divine essence in\\nall beings. He or she has “equal vision” and sees the divine Self in all,\\nregardless of the outer aspect.\\nThe last three verses of the chapter describe a state of profound\\nmeditation called samadhi. When meditation becomes very deep, breathing\\nbecomes slow, steady, and even, and the windows of the senses close to all\\noutward sensations. Next the faculties of the mind quiet down, resting from\\ntheir usually frantic activity; even the primal emotions of desire, fear, and\\nanger subside. When all these sensory and emotional tides have ceased to\\nflow, then the spirit is free, mukta – at least for the time being. It has entered\\nthe state called samadhi.\\nSamadhi can come and go; generally it can be entered only in a long\\nperiod of meditation and after many years of ardent endeavor. But one verse\\n(5:28) adds the significant word sada, “always.” Once this state of deep\\nconcentration becomes established, the person lives in spiritual freedom, or\\nmoksha, permanently. This is extremely rare. Mystics of the West as well as\\nthe East have attained brief glimpses of unity, but very few can be said to\\n\\n\\x0chave dwelt in it permanently, as if it were their natural habitat. In the West\\nthe most prominent figures are Meister Eckhart, St. Teresa of Avila, and St.\\nJohn of the Cross, though there have been others. In the Hindu tradition\\nthere is a long line of saints and mystics who have tried to communicate\\nsomething of the nature of this union with Reality or God, from the\\nunknown recorders of the Upanishads through the Buddha, Shankara, and\\nMeera, to Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c5: Renounce & Rejoice\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, you have recommended both the path of selfless action\\nand sannyasa, the path of renunciation of action. Tell me definitely\\nwhich is better.\\n1\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nBoth renunciation of action and the selfless performance of action\\nlead to the supreme goal. But the path of action is better than\\nrenunciation.\\n2\\n\\nThose who have attained perfect renunciation are free from any\\nsense of duality; they are unaffected by likes and dislikes, Arjuna,\\nand are free from the bondage of self-will. 4 The immature think\\nthat knowledge and action are different, but the wise see them as the\\nsame. The person who is established in one path will attain the\\nrewards of both. 5 The goal of knowledge and the goal of service are\\nthe same; those who fail to see this are blind.\\n3\\n\\nPerfect renunciation is difficult to attain without performing\\naction. But the wise, following the path of selfless service, quickly\\nreach Brahman.\\n6\\n\\nThose who follow the path of service, who have completely\\npurified themselves and conquered their senses and self-will, see the\\nSelf in all creatures and are untouched by any action they perform.\\n7\\n\\nThose who know this truth, whose consciousness is unified, think\\nalways, “I am not the doer.” While seeing or hearing, touching or\\n8\\n\\n\\x0csmelling; eating, moving about, or sleeping; breathing 9 or speaking,\\nletting go or holding on, even opening or closing the eyes, they\\nunderstand that these are only the movements of the senses among\\nsense objects.\\nThose who surrender to Brahman all selfish attachments are like\\nthe leaf of a lotus floating clean and dry in water. Sin cannot touch\\nthem. 11 Renouncing their selfish attachments, those who follow the\\npath of service work with body, senses, and mind for the sake of\\nself-purification.\\n10\\n\\nThose whose consciousness is unified abandon all attachment to\\nthe results of action and attain supreme peace. But those whose\\ndesires are fragmented, who are selfishly attached to the results of\\ntheir work, are bound in everything they do.\\n12\\n\\nThose who renounce attachment in all their deeds live content in\\nthe “city of nine gates,” the body, as its master. They are not driven\\nto act, nor do they involve others in action.\\n13\\n\\nNeither the sense of acting, nor actions, nor the connection of\\ncause and effect comes from the Lord of this world. These three\\narise from nature.\\n14\\n\\nThe Lord does not partake in the good and evil deeds of any\\nperson; judgment is clouded when wisdom is obscured by\\nignorance. 16 But ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self\\nwithin. The light of this knowledge shines like the sun, revealing the\\nsupreme Brahman. 17 Those who cast off sin through this\\nknowledge, absorbed in the Lord and established in him as their one\\ngoal and refuge, are not reborn as separate creatures.\\n15\\n\\nThose who possess this wisdom have equal regard for all. They\\nsee the same Self in a spiritual aspirant and an outcaste, in an\\nelephant, a cow, and a dog. 19 Such people have mastered life. With\\neven mind they rest in Brahman, who is perfect and is everywhere\\nthe same. 20 They are not elated by good fortune nor depressed by\\nbad. With mind established in Brahman, they are free from delusion.\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cNot dependent on any external support, they realize the joy of\\nspiritual awareness. With consciousness unified through meditation,\\nthey live in abiding joy.\\n21\\n\\nPleasures conceived in the world of the senses have a beginning\\nand an end and give birth to misery, Arjuna. The wise do not look\\nfor happiness in them. 23 But those who overcome the impulses of\\nlust and anger which arise in the body are made whole and live in\\njoy. 24 They find their joy, their rest, and their light completely\\nwithin themselves. United with the Lord, they attain nirvana in\\nBrahman.\\n22\\n\\nHealed of their sins and conflicts, working for the good of all\\nbeings, the holy sages attain nirvana in Brahman. 26 Free from anger\\nand selfish desire, unified in mind, those who follow the path of\\nyoga and realize the Self are established forever in that supreme\\nstate.\\n25\\n\\nClosing their eyes, steadying their breathing, and focusing their\\nattention on the center of spiritual consciousness, 28 the wise master\\ntheir senses, mind, and intellect through meditation. Self-realization\\nis their only goal. Freed from selfish desire, fear, and anger, they\\nlive in freedom always. 29 Knowing me as the friend of all creatures,\\nthe Lord of the universe, the end of all offerings and all spiritual\\ndisciplines, they attain eternal peace.\\n27\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Six\\n\\nThe Practice of Meditation\\nThis is surely one of the most intriguing chapters of the Gita, for here we\\nare given a detailed explanation of meditation addressed to the layperson.\\nThe same meditation techniques are given in more esoteric writings, such as\\nthe Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, but the Gita does it more simply, without any\\nunnecessary mystery or complexity.\\nThis chapter also explores the question, “Who is the true yogi?” This\\nword yogi, if it has any associations for the Western reader, is likely to bring\\nup images of rather far-out types who do strange contortions with their\\nbodies. Yogis are still thought of as standing on their heads or reclining on a\\nbed of nails. It is true that there are many practitioners of a kind of yoga that\\ninvolves physical exercises and postures; and there are those who have\\nachieved remarkable feats like lying on beds of nails, or even being buried\\nalive and surviving. But this physical side of yoga (called hatha yoga, “the\\nyoga of force”) is not what is meant in the Gita. In fact, though physical\\ntechniques have a place, the Gita regards undue emphasis on them as\\nextreme, not belonging to the normal course of spiritual development.\\nIn the Gita, the word yogi often has a more modest definition: it can\\nmean a person who does his or her job with detachment from the rewards\\n(6:1), or it can be rendered as “one who has attained the goal of\\nmeditation.” For yogi literally means “one who is accomplished in yoga,”\\nand yoga means “integration of the spirit.” In this sense, yoga means\\nwholeness or the process of becoming whole at the deepest spiritual level.\\nThe word yoga is also often used as a synonym for raja yoga, the practice\\nof meditation as taught by Patanjali; for meditation is the direct means of\\nbecoming integrated, united with one’s truest, deepest Self. Thus a yogi,\\namong other things, is a person who is an adept at meditation.\\nUntil now, Krishna has been instructing Arjuna in the need for karma\\nyoga, the active life of service. Now he is ready to initiate his disciple into\\nthe practice of the more interior disciplines of the spiritual life. Karma\\nyoga, he says, is the path for those who wish to climb the mountain of Selfrealization; for those who have reached the summit, the path is shama, the\\npeace of contemplation. At the beginning of the spiritual life, great exertion\\n\\n\\x0cis required; as the summit is approached, though the climb gets no easier,\\nthe dimension of contemplation or stillness is added. Many spiritual\\ntraditions, of course, use this image when speaking of the religious quest.\\nThe mountaintop is the place where the holy, like Moses, commune with\\nGod; and St. John of the Cross describes the path to union with God as\\nclimbing the mountain of Carmel.\\nIn climbing this mountain, willpower, self-help, intense personal effort,\\nare absolute essentials. The literal translation of verse 5 is “one should lift\\noneself up by one’s Self” – a play on the word atman, which can mean the\\nhighest Self as well as self in the ordinary sense. One’s self is thus one’s\\nfriend or one’s own enemy. The “lower self,” as Western mystics sometimes\\ncall it, is self-will – will in the negative, selfish sense. An unruly will\\ntwisted toward self-aggrandizement is an enemy lurking right inside the\\nfort, where it can do the most damage. But those who “have conquered\\nthemselves by themselves” have their truest friend in the Self. Only those\\nwho have genuine self-discipline, who are “self-conquered,” live in peace.\\nThese, Krishna says, are true yogis. They cannot harbor any malice,\\ncannot even bring themselves to look upon anyone as an enemy. They are\\nsamabuddhi, “of equable mind.” The true yogi, the person who is truly\\nintegrated inside, looks upon and feels everyone else’s joy and sorrow just\\nas if it were his own. He sees the Self in all beings, everywhere.\\nHow is this self-conquest to be made? Very simply, the Gita teaches that\\nthe mind must be made one-pointed through the practice of meditation. This\\nis the basic technique. In the Gita we do not see the tendency for\\nelaboration, for ritual and mystery, that we sometimes find in the Hindu\\ntradition. Krishna simply tells Arjuna, first, that he must find an appropriate\\nplace to meditate. A suitable spot for his practice will be clean and\\ncomfortable. In a nod to tradition, one verse recommends the meditation\\nseat be covered with kusha grass and a deer skin – the traditional seat of the\\nyogi. The important thing, however, is not how the meditation cushion is\\nconstructed, but what is going on in the mind. Meditation is an internal\\ndiscipline to make the mind one-pointed, absolutely concentrated.\\nSecond, Krishna offers a bit of advice about holding the body, head, and\\nneck in a straight line. This may seem esoteric – a reference to the\\ncontortion-school of yoga – but actually it has a practical purpose. Sitting\\nabsolutely straight, with the spinal column erect, prevents drowsiness. Also,\\n\\n\\x0cin advanced stages of meditation, it allows for the free flow of vital energy\\nor kundalini (see Glossary).\\nThen practical advice is given: moderation is the path. Neither extreme\\nasceticism nor indulgence will aid meditation. A superficial acquaintance\\nwith Hindu culture may leave the impression that it fosters either the\\nsensuality of the Kama Sutra or the asceticism of the hermit. It is true that\\nin Indian civilization we can easily see the ultimate development of the\\nsensual and beautiful life in its finest manifestation, in painting, sculpture,\\nmusic, and dance. And Indian cuisine is famous for its incredible variety of\\nflavors and spices. India also presents us with the austere simplicity of the\\nwandering holy man or sadhu. The Gita, however, recommends the middle\\npath. Success in meditation, Krishna says, comes neither to those who eat or\\nsleep too much nor to those who eat or sleep too little. The body should be\\nneither overindulged nor treated harshly – the same recommendation the\\nBuddha was to offer later, after many years of severe asceticism.\\nThis chapter contains the famous verse (6:19) comparing the mind to a\\nsteady flame. By its very nature the untrained mind is restless, constantly\\nwandering here and there in trying to fulfil its desires. It flickers wildly like\\na flame in a storm – never blown completely out, yet at the mercy of the\\nwind. Wherever it wanders, Krishna says, it must be brought back to its\\nsource; it must learn to rest in the Self. Once it is at home in the depths of\\ncontemplation, the mind becomes steady, like an upright, unflickering flame\\nin a windless place. In this deep meditation, and only there, can the human\\nbeing find true fulfillment. Then “the still mind touches Brahman and\\nenjoys bliss.”\\nNow Arjuna asks the inevitable question. Krishna is way ahead of him,\\nand the struggling disciple calls out, “Wait a minute!” or words to that\\neffect. He says, “My mind is so restless and unsteady that I cannot even\\ncomprehend anything about this state of mystic peace you are talking\\nabout.” The mind is so powerful, so turbulent, that trying to bring it under\\ncontrol is like trying to catch the wind.\\nKrishna admits that the mind is terribly hard to train, but he maintains\\nthat it can be done through regular practice if one has detachment. It is\\ninteresting that he does not offer to help Arjuna here; that will come later.\\nFor now, he tells Arjuna that he must do it for himself, through hard work\\nand detachment from private, personal motives.\\n\\n\\x0cThen Arjuna asks a rather surprising question: what happens to the\\nperson who believes in a spiritual goal but does not pursue it to the end?\\nWhat if one of his more powerful compulsive desires gets the better of him,\\nscattering his resolution the way a cloud is scattered by the wind? Arjuna\\nmust be at least partly convinced that there is something to all this, but\\neither he is not ready to begin meditating or he is afraid that somehow he\\nmight fail if he tried. If he were to fail, he asks, would he have lost\\neverything – all that he had given up in worldly life as well as his goal of\\nself-fulfillment?\\nAffectionately, Krishna assures Arjuna that no attempt to improve his\\nspiritual condition could possibly be a wasted effort. Even looking ahead to\\nthe next life, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. He will be\\nreborn in a household suitable for taking up his quest where he left off. In\\nhis next life, he will feel drawn to the spiritual goal once again, and he will\\nhave a head start. The general Hindu belief is that Self-realization requires\\nmany, many lives of spiritual discipline. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c6: Practice of Meditation\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nIt is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those\\nwho work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of\\nmeditation. Theirs is true renunciation. 2 Therefore, Arjuna, you\\nshould understand that renunciation and the performance of selfless\\nservice are the same. Those who cannot renounce attachment to the\\nresults of their work are far from the path.\\n1\\n\\nFor aspirants who want to climb the mountain of spiritual\\nawareness, the path is selfless work; for those who have ascended to\\nyoga the path is stillness and peace. 4 When a person has freed\\nhimself from attachment to the results of work, and from desires for\\nthe enjoyment of sense objects, he ascends to the unitive state.\\n3\\n\\nReshape yourself through the power of your will; never let\\nyourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the\\nSelf, and the will is the only enemy of the Self.\\n5\\n\\nTo those who have conquered themselves, the will is a friend. But\\nit is the enemy of those who have not found the Self within them.\\n6\\n\\nThe supreme Reality stands revealed in the consciousness of those\\nwho have conquered themselves. They live in peace, alike in cold\\nand heat, pleasure and pain, praise and blame.\\n7\\n\\nThey are completely fulfilled by spiritual wisdom and Selfrealization. Having conquered their senses, they have climbed to the\\nsummit of human consciousness. To such people a clod of dirt, a\\nstone, and gold are the same. 9 They are equally disposed to family,\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cenemies, and friends, to those who support them and those who are\\nhostile, to the good and the evil alike. Because they are impartial,\\nthey rise to great heights.\\nThose who aspire to the state of yoga should seek the Self in\\ninner solitude through meditation. With body and mind controlled\\nthey should constantly practice one-pointedness, free from\\nexpectations and attachment to material possessions.\\n10\\n\\nSelect a clean spot, neither too high nor too low, and seat yourself\\nfirmly on a cloth, a deerskin, and kusha grass. 12 Then, once seated,\\nstrive to still your thoughts. Make your mind one-pointed in\\nmeditation, and your heart will be purified. 13 Hold your body, head,\\nand neck firmly in a straight line, and keep your eyes from\\nwandering. 14 With all fears dissolved in the peace of the Self and\\nall desires dedicated to Brahman, controlling the mind and fixing it\\non me, sit in meditation with me as your only goal. 15 With senses\\nand mind constantly controlled through meditation, united with the\\nSelf within, an aspirant attains nirvana, the state of abiding joy and\\npeace in me.\\n11\\n\\nArjuna, those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too\\nmuch or sleep too little, will not succeed in meditation. 17 But those\\nwho are temperate in eating and sleeping, work and recreation, will\\ncome to the end of sorrow through meditation. 18 Through constant\\neffort they learn to withdraw the mind from selfish cravings and\\nabsorb it in the Self. Thus they attain the state of union.\\n16\\n\\nWhen meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the\\nflame of a lamp in a windless place. 20 In the still mind, in the\\ndepths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by\\nmeans of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete\\nfulfillment. 21 Having attained that abiding joy beyond the senses,\\nrevealed in the stilled mind, he never swerves from the eternal truth.\\n22 He desires nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest\\nburden of sorrow.\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cThe practice of meditation frees one from all affliction. This is the\\npath of yoga. Follow it with determination and sustained\\nenthusiasm. 24 Renouncing wholeheartedly all selfish desires and\\nexpectations, use your will to control the senses. 25 Little by little,\\nthrough patience and repeated effort, the mind will become stilled in\\nthe Self.\\n23\\n\\nWherever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for\\nsatisfaction without, lead it within; train it to rest in the Self 27\\nAbiding joy comes to those who still the mind. Freeing themselves\\nfrom the taint of self-will, with their consciousness unified, they\\nbecome one with Brahman.\\n26\\n\\nThe infinite joy of touching Brahman is easily attained by those\\nwho are free from the burden of evil and established within\\nthemselves. 29 They see the Self in every creature and all creation in\\nthe Self. With consciousness unified through meditation, they see\\neverything with an equal eye.\\n28\\n\\nI am ever present to those who have realized me in every\\ncreature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never\\nseparated from me. 31 They worship me in the hearts of all, and all\\ntheir actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide\\nin me.\\n30\\n\\nWhen a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if\\nthey were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual\\nunion.\\n32\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, the stillness of divine union which you describe is\\nbeyond my comprehension. How can the mind, which is so restless,\\nattain lasting peace? 34 Krishna, the mind is restless, turbulent,\\npowerful, violent; trying to control it is like trying to tame the wind.\\n33\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\n\\x0cIt is true that the mind is restless and difficult to control. But it\\ncan be conquered, Arjuna, through regular practice and detachment.\\n36 Those who lack self-control will find it difficult to progress in\\nmeditation; but those who are self-controlled, striving earnestly\\nthrough the right means, will attain the goal.\\n35\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nKrishna, what happens to the man who has faith but who lacks\\nself-control and wanders from the path, not attaining success in\\nyoga? 38 If a man becomes deluded on the spiritual path, will he lose\\nthe support of both worlds, like a cloud scattered in the sky? 39\\nKrishna, you can dispel all doubts; remove this doubt which binds\\nme.\\n37\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nArjuna, my son, such a person will not be destroyed. No one who\\ndoes good work will ever come to a bad end, either here or in the\\nworld to come.\\n40\\n\\nWhen such people die, they go to other realms where the\\nrighteous live. They dwell there for countless years and then are\\nreborn into a home which is pure and prosperous. 42 Or they may be\\nborn into a family where meditation is practiced; to be born into\\nsuch a family is extremely rare. 43 The wisdom they have acquired\\nin previous lives will be reawakened, Arjuna, and they will strive\\neven harder for Self-realization. 44 Indeed, they will be driven on by\\nthe strength of their past disciplines. Even one who inquires after\\nthe practice of meditation rises above those who simply perform\\nrituals.\\n41\\n\\nThrough constant effort over many lifetimes, a person becomes\\npurified of all selfish desires and attains the supreme goal of life.\\n45\\n\\nMeditation is superior to severe asceticism and the path of\\nknowledge. It is also superior to selfless service. May you attain the\\ngoal of meditation, Arjuna! 47 Even among those who meditate, that\\n46\\n\\n\\x0cman or woman who worships me with perfect faith, completely\\nabsorbed in me, is the most firmly established in yoga.\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Seven\\n\\nWisdom from Realization\\nIn Sanskrit this chapter is called “The Yoga of Wisdom and Realization” –\\nor “The Yoga of Wisdom from Realization.” The term used for wisdom is\\njnana; for realization, vijnana. There is room for confusion in this\\nterminology, as jnana and vijnana are open to differing interpretations. Both\\nwords are from the root jna, “to know,” which is related to the Greek word\\ngnosis. The prefix vi added to a noun usually intensifies its meaning; so\\nvijnana could mean to know intensely or to a greater degree. In this context,\\nhowever, jnana is the standard term for the highest kind of knowledge: not\\nscholarship or book-learning but direct knowledge of God, spiritual\\nwisdom. If we take jnana in this sense, we are not left with an obvious\\nmeaning for vijnana, a “more intense kind of jnana.” Ramakrishna takes\\nvijnana to mean an intimate, practical familiarity with God, the ability to\\ncarry through in daily affairs with the more abstract understanding that is\\njnana. Ramakrishna says, “One who has merely heard of fire has ajnana,\\nignorance. One who has seen fire has jnana. But one who has actually built\\na fire and cooked on it has vijnana.”\\nIn this chapter we find ourselves following several trails and sometimes\\nlose the unifying theme, which is knowledge of the supreme reality\\nunderlying nature. Eventually, however, we come back to the starting point:\\nknowledge contrasted with ignorance, transcendent reality as opposed to the\\nphenomenal world.\\nBut to pursue the byways. First, Krishna’s “two natures” are discussed.\\nOn the one hand, he has created out of himself the elements and all things\\nthat make up the phenomenal world. Beyond this is Krishna’s spiritual\\nnature as the transcendent Lord of the universe. Here the Gita is referring to\\na concept that later became a basis of the Sankhya school of Hindu\\nphilosophy. Sankhya recognized two fundamental principles underlying all\\nthings: prakriti, the principle of mind and matter, and Purusha, the principle\\nof pure spirit. The union of these two eternal, fundamental forces sets in\\nmotion the creation of the world as we know it. Their union also shapes and\\ndefines all ordinary human experience. In Sankhya, the goal of Self-\\n\\n\\x0crealization is seen as the final freeing of the spirit (Purusha) from its\\nflirtation with mind and matter (prakriti).\\nUnlike Sankhya, however, in the Gita it is Krishna who is behind both\\nprakriti and Purusha. In this chapter, Krishna is presented as the Creator of\\nthe world. His divine nature can be glimpsed in his bewildering and\\nwonderful creation. In much Hindu mythology, it is the god Brahma who\\ntakes credit for creating the world. It is he, the four-faced deity, who has\\nflung forth the manifold worlds of this and former (as well as future)\\nuniverses. But in the mythology of Vishnu, Brahma is born in the lotus that\\ngrows from Vishnu’s navel. The lotus is Vishnu’s womb. In it Brahma is\\nborn, and at Vishnu’s urging he creates the worlds. Vishnu is the real\\nCreator; Brahma is a demigod born of Vishnu’s will to create. Here in the\\nGita Krishna directly assumes all the roles and honors usually shared with\\nthe other aspects of God worshipped in the Hindu faith. It is not that these\\nother divine personifications are rejected, but simply that all attention is on\\nKrishna. For the author of the Gita, Krishna is the form of God to be\\nworshipped, and for the time being all other forms of God disappear.\\nKrishna alone is. In fact, one verse states that whatever other god one seems\\nto worship, one is in reality approaching Krishna himself. Worshipping him,\\nknowing him, enables the devotee to attain the goal.\\nThough the word is not used in the Gita, the idea of the world as\\nKrishna’s lila, his play, became a cherished theme of later Hinduism.\\nKrishna, it is said, created the world in play: just as a child might desire to\\nhave companions to play with, Krishna desired companions, and made the\\nworld. Krishna participates in the game of life; his divine qualities shine\\nthrough in the world wherever there is excellence of any kind. He is, he\\ntells Arjuna, the essence of every created thing: the sapidity of water, the\\nbrightness of fire, the effort of the spiritual aspirant. This may be what is\\nmeant by the vijnana of our title – the mystic’s vision of the divine as\\npresent here and now is perhaps the real meaning of the term.\\nThe word maya appears here, though not for the first time in the Gita.\\nJust as the concepts of prakriti and Purusha are later developed in Sankhya\\nphilosophy, maya is later built into the formal structure of Vedanta, another\\nof the six major schools of Indian philosophy. The word maya comes from\\nthe root ma, “to measure out,” and originally meant the power of a deity to\\ncreate, especially to create what Indian philosophy calls “name and form”:\\nmatter and its percepts. Maya was the magical capacity to create form and\\n\\n\\x0cillusion – a god’s divine power to put on a disguise, or to fling forth world\\nafter world of life. Maya is also the outward look of things, the passing\\nshow that conceals immortal being. Maya can be both delightful and\\ndangerous, alluring and yet treacherous. The gunas, the three basic qualities\\nof all created things, swirl within the world of maya. Crossing over the\\nocean of maya is the goal of the wise voyager, and one boat is devotion. In\\nthis chapter the Gita begins to stress the importance of love and devotion –\\nthemes that later become dominant.\\nKrishna’s true nature is hidden by maya (7:25). The dangers of maya are\\nnot depicted strongly in this chapter, but the “delusions” – moha – of life in\\nmaya’s world are hinted at; they are, essentially, the self-centered\\nattachments Krishna has been warning against. Moha, which means\\nconfusion or delusion, is something like dreaming while awake, “living in a\\ndream.” The duality of attachment and aversion (love and hate) beguiles the\\nmind into this moha-swoon right at birth (7:27). Knowing Krishna, and\\ndevotion to him, is the way beyond this delusion. Thus chapter 7 contrasts\\nwisdom (jnana and vijnana) with the delusion (moha) of spiritual\\nignorance.\\nWe find here many seminal ideas that are elaborated in the later\\nphilosophies of Sankhya and Vedanta. These concepts of prakriti, Purusha,\\nand maya do not originate with the Gita, however. The word maya appears\\nin the Rig Veda, the most ancient of the Vedas, and Purusha is a recurring\\ntheme in the Upanishads. The Gita is a halfway point between the\\nspontaneous insights of the Upanishads and the later, highly formalized\\nphilosophical systems. In the Gita we find an organized presentation of\\nthese and other key concepts without a cumbersome technical explanation. –\\nD.M.\\n\\n\\x0c7: Wisdom from Realization\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nWith your mind intent on me, Arjuna, discipline yourself with the\\npractice of yoga. Depend on me completely. Listen, and I will dispel\\nall your doubts; you will come to know me fully and be united with\\nme.\\n1\\n\\nI will give you both jnana and vijnana. When both these are\\nrealized, there is nothing more you need to know.\\n2\\n\\nOne person in many thousands may seek perfection, yet of these\\nonly a few reach the goal and come to realize me. 4 Earth, water,\\nfire, air, akasha, mind, intellect, and ego – these are the eight\\ndivisions of my prakriti. 5 But beyond this I have another, higher\\nnature, Arjuna; it supports the whole universe and is the source of\\nlife in all beings.\\n3\\n\\nIn these two aspects of my nature is the womb of all creation. The\\nbirth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. 7 There is\\nnothing that exists separate from me, Arjuna. The entire universe is\\nsuspended from me as my necklace of jewels.\\n6\\n\\nArjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun\\nand moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the\\ncourage of human beings. 9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and\\nthe radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving\\nof the spiritual aspirant.\\n8\\n\\nMy eternal seed, Arjuna, is to be found in every creature. I am the\\npower of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cof the noble. 11 In those who are strong, I am strength, free from\\npassion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in\\nharmony with the purpose of life.\\nThe states of sattva, rajas, and tamas come from me, but I am not\\nin them. 13 These three gunas deceive the world: people fail to look\\nbeyond them to me, supreme and imperishable. 14 The three gunas\\nmake up my divine maya, difficult to overcome. But they cross over\\nthis maya who take refuge in me. 15 Others are deluded by maya;\\nperforming evil deeds, they have no devotion to me. Having lost all\\ndiscrimination, they follow the way of their lower nature.\\n12\\n\\nGood people come to worship me for different reasons. Some\\ncome to the spiritual life because of suffering, some in order to\\nunderstand life; some come through a desire to achieve life’s\\npurpose, and some come who are men and women of wisdom. 17\\nUnwavering in devotion, always united with me, the man or woman\\nof wisdom surpasses all the others. To them I am the dearest\\nbeloved, and they are very dear to me. 18 All those who follow the\\nspiritual path are blessed. But the wise who are always established\\nin union, for whom there is no higher goal than me, may be\\nregarded as my very Self.\\n16\\n\\nAfter many births the wise seek refuge in me, seeing me\\neverywhere and in everything. Such great souls are very rare. 20\\nThere are others whose discrimination is misled by many desires.\\nFollowing their own nature, they worship lower gods, practicing\\nvarious rites.\\n19\\n\\nWhen a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I\\nunify his faith in that. 22 Then, when faith is completely unified, one\\ngains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by\\nme. 23 Those whose understanding is small attain only transient\\nsatisfaction: those who worship the gods go to the gods. But my\\ndevotees come to me.\\n21\\n\\nThrough lack of understanding, people believe that I, the\\nUnmanifest, have entered into some form. They fail to realize my\\n24\\n\\n\\x0ctrue nature, which transcends birth and death. 25 Few see through\\nthe veil of maya. The world, deluded, does not know that I am\\nwithout birth and changeless. 26 I know everything about the past,\\nthe present, and the future, Arjuna; but there is no one who knows\\nme completely.\\nDelusion arises from the duality of attraction and aversion,\\nArjuna; every creature is deluded by these from birth. 28 But those\\nwho have freed themselves from all wrongdoing are firmly\\nestablished in worship of me. Their actions are pure, and they are\\nfree from the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites.\\n27\\n\\nThose who take refuge in me, striving for liberation from old age\\nand death, come to know Brahman, the Self, and the nature of all\\naction. 30 Those who see me ruling the cosmos, who see me in the\\nadhibhuta, the adhidaiva, and the adhiyajna, are conscious of me\\neven at the time of death.\\n29\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Eight\\n\\nEternal Godhead\\nThis chapter alludes briefly to several important concepts presented more\\nfully in the Upanishads, and it will be helpful to quote the Upanishads to\\nelucidate these points. Also, this chapter presents a very ancient view of the\\nsoul’s journey after death. These ideas about the afterlife did not originate\\nin the Gita, and are even more ancient than the Upanishads. Another ancient\\nconcept here is that of a cyclical universe, which is elaborated in other\\nHindu scriptures in great detail; this chapter merely refers to it in passing.\\nThe chapter begins with Arjuna asking what appear to be questions of\\ntheology, but the role of theologian does not fit him naturally. These\\nquestions are asked in response to the technical terms mentioned in the last\\nverse of chapter 7. The sense of Krishna’s answer is in accord with what he\\nsaid earlier about his maya: he is God immanent in all things as well as God\\ntranscendent.\\nBut it is Arjuna’s other question that determines the direction the\\ndiscourse now takes. Arjuna asks how Krishna can be known at the hour of\\ndeath. Here, of course, Arjuna means Krishna in his cosmic, mystical\\naspect, so he is asking in essence, “How can the Self-realized person enter\\nthe supreme state of immortality at the time of death?” Krishna replies that\\nwhoever remembers him at the time of death will enter madbhavam, “my\\nbeing.” If Arjuna can remember Krishna in the hour of death, he will be\\nunited with Krishna and enter into immortality.\\nIn fact, whatever it may be, the content of the mind at the hour of death\\ndirects the soul in its journey to rebirth. Thus the mind influences the\\nevolution of the soul as it moves into the next life. Whatever a person thinks\\nabout in life – his or her deepest motivations – are likely to be the last\\nthoughts at the time of death. So there is a continuity between this life and\\nthe next, and all the baggage of desire and motivation goes right along with\\nthe soul. But here Krishna is talking about the person – he hopes Arjuna\\nwill be such a one – who has no worldly baggage, who will remember\\nKrishna at the final hour.\\nTo ensure he will focus his devotion on Krishna at the hour of death,\\nArjuna should make a practice of remembering him continually now. If he\\n\\n\\x0cmakes his mind one-pointed in meditation and learns to focus his being on\\nKrishna, then naturally at the time of death he will think of nothing else.\\nOtherwise, in the chaos of death, he will panic and lose his way.\\nKrishna describes in detail what happens to consciousness at the moment\\nof death (8:12–13). These verses actually describe the yogis as being in\\ncontrol of the process of death. Directing their consciousness step by step\\nthrough the difficult ordeal of leaving the body, they attain the supreme\\ngoal. This idea is also accepted by one of the greatest teachers of meditation\\nin ancient India, Patanjali, who says in the Yoga Sutras that the yogi dies at\\nwill. Similar descriptions of the death process occur in the Upanishads,\\nthough there the dying person is not necessarily in control. The Upanishads\\ngive a detailed account:\\nWhen the Self seems to become weak and sink into unconsciousness,\\nthe vital breaths gather to him. Then he takes with him those particles of\\nlight and descends into the heart. When the consciousness that is in the\\neye turns back, the dying person no longer sees any form. “He is\\nbecoming one,” they say; “he does not see.” “He is becoming one,” they\\nsay; “he does not smell.” “He is becoming one,” they say; “he does not\\ntaste.” “He is becoming one,” they say; “he does not speak.” “He is\\nbecoming one,” they say; “he does not hear.” “He is becoming one,”\\nthey say; “he does not think or touch or know.” The point of his heart\\nlights up, and by that light the Self departs, either through the eye, or the\\nskull, or through some other door of the body. And when he departs, life\\ndeparts: and when life departs, all other vital forces depart after it. He is\\nconscious, and with consciousness he leaves the body. Then his\\nknowledge and his works and his previous impressions go along with\\nhim. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad iv.4.1–2)\\nFirst consciousness is withdrawn from the senses. The dying no longer\\nhear or see what is going on around them. They are still conscious, but the\\n“light” of consciousness has been withdrawn from the senses, here called\\nthe “gates” of the body. There are said to be nine such gates: two eyes, two\\nnostrils, two ears, the mouth, and the organs of generation and excretion.\\nSometimes two more are added: the navel and the sagittal suture, located at\\nthe top of the skull and called in Sanskrit brahmarandhra, “the aperture of\\nBrahman.”\\n\\n\\x0cWhen consciousness has been withdrawn from these gates, Krishna says,\\n“the mind is placed [“locked up”] in the heart.” (8:12) Here, as in Christian\\nmysticism, it is the heart and not the head that is taken to be the home of the\\nsoul. Probably what is meant is the heart chakra, the center of\\nconsciousness corresponding to the center of the chest. Prana (vital energy)\\nand awareness have been withdrawn from the outer frontiers of personality\\nand consolidated within. At this stage of the death process an ordinary\\nperson has no access to the will; but it is just here that prana, with\\nconscious awareness, must be made to move upwards to the head. If prana\\nleaves the body through the brahmarandhra, there will be no rebirth: that is,\\nthe dying person will enter samadhi at the time of death. In samadhi, prana\\nis withdrawn from lower levels of awareness to rush upwards to the seventh\\ncenter at the crown of the head. This is possible only for the yogi who has\\nthoroughly mastered meditation and the control of prana. If prana exits\\nthrough some other one of the eleven doors of the body, the Upanishads say,\\nthe state of immortality will not be gained:\\nWhen he departs from this body, he ascends with the rays of the sun,\\nrepeating the syllable Om. As soon as he thinks of it, he comes to the\\nsun. That, indeed, is the door to the next world. Those who know enter;\\nthose who do not know are stopped. There is a verse:\\nA hundred and one subtle tracks lead from the heart;\\nOne of these goes upwards to the crown of the head.\\nGoing up by it, he goes to eternal life.\\nOthers depart in various directions.\\n(Chandogya Upanishad viii.6.5–6)\\nIn the Gita, as well as in this passage from the Chandogya Upanishad, the\\nmantram Om is used. If the yogis can remember the mantram even as\\nconsciousness itself is departing the body – and, the Gita adds, if they can\\nmeditate on Krishna – they will go to the “highest goal.” Relinquishing the\\nbody in a state of samadhi, they attain the mystic eternity that is union with\\nKrishna.\\nIn this chapter the Gita alludes to the two paths, “northern” and\\n“southern,” that the soul may take after death. Verses 24–25 present in\\n\\n\\x0cabbreviated form what the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad spells out in obscure\\ndetail:\\nThose who know this, who meditate upon Truth with faith while living\\nin the forest, go to the light, from light to day, from day to the fortnight\\nof the moon’s waxing, from the waxing fortnight to the six months of\\nthe sun’s northern journey, from those six months to the world of the\\ndevas, from the world of the devas to the sun, from the sun to the\\nlightning. Then a spirit approaches them and leads them to the world of\\nBrahman. In that world they live for eternal ages. They do not return\\nagain.\\nBut those who conquer worlds through sacrifice, charity, and austerity\\npass into the smoke, from the smoke into the night, from the night into\\nthe fortnight of the waning moon, from the fortnight of the waning\\nmoon into the six months of the sun’s southern journey, from there into\\nthe world of the ancestors, from the world of the ancestors into the\\nmoon, . . . and from there to rebirth. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad\\nvi.2.15–16)\\n“Northern and southern paths” refers to the path of the sun, which seems\\nto move northward after the winter solstice and southward after the summer\\nsolstice. To die during the period in which the sun is moving southward was\\nconsidered inauspicious; dying during the period after the winter solstice,\\nwhen the sun is moving back north, meant the soul might take the northern\\npath which leads to immortality. In the Gita and the Upanishads, this\\n“northern path” has come to signify that the soul has been released from\\nkarma and need not be reborn. The southern path, by contrast, leads the soul\\nto a new birth in this world, a birth suitable to its karma. This view of the\\nsoul’s journey after death has a primordial quality about it, giving the\\nfeeling that it far predates even the Upanishads. Perhaps it is a belief of very\\nancient times that found its way into the Upanishads, which say that the\\nspiritually ready soul makes the journey of the northern route while those\\nwho have only practiced rituals take the southern.\\nThis chapter also briefly alludes to the Days and Nights of Brahma.\\nBrahma is the Creator of the Hindu trinity, who brings forth the cosmos at\\nthe will of Vishnu. But Brahma in a sense is not in control of this creative\\n\\n\\x0cprocess. Just as day follows night in eternal, unvarying rhythm, so does the\\nentire universe undergo cycles of creation, death, and new birth. As the Day\\nof Brahma dawns, the cosmos comes into being; as the Day comes to an\\nend, the entire creation dies and ceases to exist. Then, for a Night as long as\\nthe cosmic Day, the universe rests. It ceases to be – or, rather, it continues\\nonly in a subtle, unmanifest form, a dream in the mind of Vishnu, who lies\\nsleeping on the waves of the cosmic ocean. Then, without deviating from\\nthe eternal rhythm, the cosmos is reborn when the Night is over. The new\\nuniverse dawns, and Brahma once again moves into his active, creative\\nDay.\\nScholars have noted that this grand vision of the cosmos being born,\\ndying, and being reborn for eternity – cosmos after cosmos arising from the\\nblack immensity of nothingness – is quite similar to modern theories of the\\nexpanding and contracting universe put forward by contemporary\\ncosmology. The vast time spans accepted by present-day physics are also\\nsimilar to the cosmic Days and Nights of Brahma. Each Day lasts for a\\nthousand yugas, which equals 4,320,000,000 years. For this near-eternity of\\ntime the universe lives and grows; then it dies and lies dormant for an equal\\ntime, before the new Day dawns.\\nThere is a state of being, however, that is higher than the perishable\\ncosmos, which is not born and does not die the cosmic death. Here (8:20) it\\nis called simply avyakta, the Unmanifest. This is the supreme goal of all\\nliving things, and it is Krishna’s home (8:21). Returning to this final resting\\nplace, the soul enters into immortal bliss and is not reborn. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c8: Eternal Godhead\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, what is Brahman, and what is the nature of action?\\nWhat is the adhyatma, the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva? 2 What is the\\nadhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, and how is it to be offered? How\\nare the self-controlled united with you at the time of death?\\n1\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nMy highest nature, the imperishable Brahman, gives every\\ncreature its existence and lives in every creature as the adhyatma.\\nMy action is creation and the bringing forth of creatures. 4 The\\nadhibhuta is the perishable body; the adhidaiva is Purusha, eternal\\nspirit. The adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, is made to me as the\\nLord within you.\\n3\\n\\nThose who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do\\nnot doubt this. 6 Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death\\ndetermines the destination of the dying; always they will tend\\ntoward that state of being. 7 Therefore, remember me at all times\\nand fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely\\ncome to me. 8 When you make your mind one-pointed through\\nregular practice of meditation, you will find the supreme glory of\\nthe Lord.\\n5\\n\\nThe Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler,\\nsubtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable,\\nbright as the sun, beyond darkness. 10 Remembering him in this way\\nat the time of death, through devotion and the power of meditation,\\nwith your mind completely stilled and your concentration fixed in\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cthe center of spiritual awareness between the eyebrows, you will\\nrealize the supreme Lord.\\nI will tell you briefly of the eternal state all scriptures affirm,\\nwhich can be entered only by those who are self-controlled and free\\nfrom selfish passions. Those whose lives are dedicated to Brahman\\nattain this supreme goal.\\n11\\n\\nRemembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of\\nthe senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in\\nmeditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. 13 Repeating in\\nthis state the divine name, the syllable Om that represents the\\nchangeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the\\nsupreme goal.\\n12\\n\\nI am easily attained by the person who always remembers me and\\nis attached to nothing else. Such a person is a true yogi, Arjuna. 15\\nGreat souls make their lives perfect and discover me; they are freed\\nfrom mortality and the suffering of this separate existence. 16 Every\\ncreature in the universe is subject to rebirth, Arjuna, except the one\\nwho is united with me.\\n14\\n\\nThose who understand the cosmic laws know that the Day of\\nBrahma ends after a thousand yugas and the Night of Brahma ends\\nafter a thousand yugas. 18 When the day of Brahma dawns, forms\\nare brought forth from the Unmanifest; when the night of Brahma\\ncomes, these forms merge in the Formless again. 19 This multitude\\nof beings is created and destroyed again and again in the succeeding\\ndays and nights of Brahma. 20 But beyond this formless state there\\nis another, unmanifested reality, which is eternal and is not\\ndissolved when the cosmos is destroyed. 21 Those who realize life’s\\nsupreme goal know that I am unmanifested and unchanging. Having\\ncome home to me, they never return to separate existence.\\n17\\n\\nThis supreme Lord who pervades all existence, the true Self of all\\ncreatures, may be realized through undivided love. 23 There are two\\npaths, Arjuna, which the soul may follow at the time of death. One\\nleads to rebirth and the other to liberation.\\n22\\n\\n\\x0cThe six months of the northern path of the sun, the path of light,\\nof fire, of day, of the bright fortnight, leads knowers of Brahman to\\nthe supreme goal. 25 The six months of the southern path of the sun,\\nthe path of smoke, of night, of the dark fortnight, leads other souls\\nto the light of the moon and to rebirth.\\n24\\n\\nThese two paths, the light and the dark, are said to be eternal,\\nleading some to liberation and others to rebirth. 27 Once you have\\nknown these two paths, Arjuna, you can never be deluded again.\\nAttain this knowledge through perseverance in yoga. 28 There is\\nmerit in studying the scriptures, in selfless service, austerity, and\\ngiving, but the practice of meditation carries you beyond all these to\\nthe supreme abode of the highest Lord.\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Nine\\n\\nThe Royal Path\\nThis chapter praises Krishna as the Supreme Being who has created the\\nworld and dwells immanent in his creation. Krishna’s exalted nature is\\nstressed, and warning is given to those who think that God is limited to his\\ncreation. It is true that Krishna has taken on a human form, but those who\\nsee only a limited human being and show him disrespect are courting great\\nspiritual harm. These verses contain a warning for those who would\\nunderestimate Krishna’s divine power.\\nIn this chapter Krishna replaces the many gods and goddesses of the\\nusual Hindu pantheon, each of which represents a different divine power;\\nhere Krishna is seen as containing within himself all such powers. It is\\nKrishna and Krishna alone who is to be worshipped: he is the goal, the\\nsupport, the only refuge, the one true friend; he is the beginning and the end\\n(9:18).\\nIt follows that those who practice a ritual religion, offering the ritual\\nsacrifices ordained by the Vedas, do not attain the true goal of their lives.\\nTrue, they do enjoy heaven after death. But when their store of merit is used\\nup, they are born again in order to have another chance at turning away\\nfrom personal gain and aiming at life’s supreme goal. So long as they are\\nmotivated only by self-centered desires they must be born again and again,\\nand their spiritual evolution either stands still or they make very little\\nprogress.\\nEven these souls, however, are really worshipping Krishna, though they\\ndo not know it. They seek Krishna, the Supreme Being, in all their\\nwanderings through many, many lives and even in their sojourns in heaven,\\nwhere they enjoy the reward of their good deeds. Because they do not know\\nhis real nature, however, they will not attain the goal, but will be reborn.\\nAn endless round of rebirths may seem like a living damnation of the\\nstruggling soul – a harsh note that would be uncharacteristic of the Gita.\\nBut this is not a question of damnation. The purpose of life is to realize\\nGod, and until this is done, the soul cannot escape creating more karma\\nwhich has to be worked out, however many lives it might take. The choice\\nto turn toward Self-realization is always open.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Gita does not dwell on the obstacles, however, but quickly goes on\\nto reveal Krishna’s more compassionate nature. It makes the point that\\nwhatever a person deeply desires – whatever he or she worships – will\\neventually be attained, in some life or other. In particular, to have real,\\nselfless love, regardless of the object, is to love Krishna, the ultimate good.\\nThis kind of love, called bhakti, is far more potent than observances and\\nrituals – a point the Gita is slowly revealing. But to have this devotion\\nwithout understanding Krishna’s nature is not enough. In the end, to attain\\nhis goal, Arjuna must have devotion and understand it is Krishna’s\\nuniversal aspect that he loves. Then he will truly attain the eternal, immortal\\nstate.\\nThis chapter contains a famous and very popular series of verses:\\nWhatever you do, make it an offering to me – the food you eat, the\\nsacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. In this way\\nyou will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both\\npleasant and painful. (9:27–28)\\nKrishna accepts every offering made to him in the right spirit; he assures\\nArjuna of this. Then he demands that Arjuna make everything – every act,\\nevery meal, every sacrifice, every gift, even his sufferings – an offering to\\nGod. He demands this so that Arjuna can be released from the bondage of\\nkarma. This is a new emphasis, a new way. If Arjuna can live in complete\\nunion with Krishna’s will, doing everything for Krishna alone, then by that\\nvery purity of will he will be free from selfish motives and thus released\\nfrom karma. His spirit will be free, and he will attain his goal of mystic\\nunion with Krishna.\\nKrishna declares that he is impartial to all creatures: he neither favors nor\\nrejects anyone. It is their sincere love that is important. Those who are truly\\ndevoted to Krishna live in him, and he abides in them. With some daring,\\nprobably at the risk of discomfort to the more orthodox, Krishna adds that\\neven a sinner who takes wholehearted refuge in him becomes good. The\\nword used is sadhu, which literally means a good person but has come to\\nsignify one who leads the spiritual life, giving up all selfish desires to\\nachieve the final goal. The word for sinner, sudurachara, should not be\\npassed by either. Su is literally “good”; dur is “bad”: thus “one whose\\nconduct is really bad,” as we might say “good and hot” to mean really hot.\\n\\n\\x0cKrishna promises that his devotees must attain peace at last. No one who\\nhas genuine love and devotion can perish. The meaning here is taken to be\\n“perish” in a spiritual sense, come to spiritual harm. The message of this\\nchapter is simple. It contains no philosophy and only a little theology. The\\none message is: anyone who has real love, love for the Lord of Love who is\\nin all creatures, will in the end attain the goal. This is the royal secret that\\nKrishna had promised to reveal. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c9: The Royal Path\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nBecause of your faith, I shall tell you the most profound of secrets:\\nobtaining both jnana and vijnana, you will be free from all evil.\\n1\\n\\nThis royal knowledge, this royal secret, is the greatest purifier.\\nRighteous and imperishable, it is a joy to practice and can be\\ndirectly experienced. 3 But those who have no faith in the supreme\\nlaw of life do not find me, Arjuna. They return to the world, passing\\nfrom death to death.\\n2\\n\\nI pervade the entire universe in my unmanifested form. All\\ncreatures find their existence in me, but I am not limited by them. 5\\nBehold my divine mystery! These creatures do not really dwell in\\nme, and though I bring them forth and support them, I am not\\nconfined within them. 6 They move in me as the winds move in\\nevery direction in space.\\n4\\n\\nAt the end of the eon these creatures return to unmanifested\\nmatter; at the beginning of the next cycle I send them forth again. 8\\nControlling my prakriti, again and again I bring forth these myriad\\nforms and subject them to the laws of prakriti. 9 None of these\\nactions binds me, Arjuna. I am unattached to them, so they do not\\ndisturb my nature.\\n7\\n\\nUnder my watchful eye the laws of nature take their course. Thus\\nis the world set in motion; thus the animate and the inanimate are\\ncreated.\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cThe immature do not look beyond physical appearances to see my\\ntrue nature as the Lord of all creation. 12 The knowledge of such\\ndeluded people is empty; their lives are fraught with disaster and\\nevil, and their work and hopes are all in vain.\\n11\\n\\nBut truly great souls seek my divine nature. They worship me\\nwith a one-pointed mind, having realized that I am the eternal\\nsource of all. 14 Constantly striving, they make firm their resolve\\nand worship me without wavering. Full of devotion, they sing of my\\ndivine glory.\\n13\\n\\nOthers follow the path of jnana, spiritual wisdom. They see that\\nwhere there is One, that One is me; where there are many, all are\\nme; they see my face everywhere.\\n15\\n\\nI am the ritual and the sacrifice; I am true medicine and the\\nmantram. I am the offering and the fire which consumes it, and the\\none to whom it is offered.\\n16\\n\\nI am the father and mother of this universe, and its grandfather\\ntoo; I am its entire support. I am the sum of all knowledge, the\\npurifier, the syllable Om; I am the sacred scriptures, the Rig, Yajur,\\nand Sama Vedas.\\n17\\n\\nI am the goal of life, the Lord and support of all, the inner\\nwitness, the abode of all. I am the only refuge, the one true friend; I\\nam the beginning, the staying, and the end of creation; I am the\\nwomb and the eternal seed.\\n18\\n\\nI am heat; I give and withhold the rain. I am immortality and I am\\ndeath; I am what is and what is not.\\n19\\n\\nThose who follow the rituals given in the Vedas, who offer\\nsacrifices and take soma, free themselves from evil and attain the\\nvast heaven of the gods, where they enjoy celestial pleasures. 21\\nWhen they have enjoyed these fully, their merit is exhausted and\\nthey return to this land of death. Thus observing Vedic rituals but\\ncaught in an endless chain of desires, they come and go.\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cThose who worship me and meditate on me constantly, without\\nany other thought – I will provide for all their needs.\\n22\\n\\nThose who worship other gods with faith and devotion also\\nworship me, Arjuna, even if they do not observe the usual forms. 24\\nI am the object of all worship, its enjoyer and Lord. But those who\\nfail to realize my true nature must be reborn. 25 Those who worship\\nthe devas will go to the realm of the devas; those who worship their\\nancestors will be united with them after death. Those who worship\\nphantoms will become phantoms; but my devotees will come to me.\\n23\\n\\nWhatever I am offered in devotion with a pure heart – a leaf, a\\nflower, fruit, or water – I accept with joy. 27 Whatever you do, make\\nit an offering to me – the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the\\nhelp you give, even your suffering. 28 In this way you will be freed\\nfrom the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and\\npainful. Then, firm in renunciation and yoga, with your heart free,\\nyou will come to me.\\n26\\n\\nI look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and\\nnone more dear. But those who worship me with love live in me,\\nand I come to life in them.\\n29\\n\\nEven sinners become holy when they take refuge in me alone. 31\\nQuickly their souls conform to dharma and they attain to boundless\\npeace. Never forget this, Arjuna: no one who is devoted to me will\\never come to harm.\\n30\\n\\nAll those who take refuge in me, whatever their birth, race, sex,\\nor caste, will attain the supreme goal; this realization can be attained\\neven by those whom society scorns. 33 Kings and sages too seek this\\ngoal with devotion. Therefore, having been born in this transient\\nand forlorn world, give all your love to me. 34 Fill your mind with\\nme; love me; serve me; worship me always. Seeking me in your\\nheart, you will at last be united with me.\\n32\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Ten\\n\\nDivine Splendor\\nKrishna goes deeper into the revelation of his divine being, revealing\\nhimself as the source from which all things come, the One who is the reality\\nbehind the many. Though the source of all virtues, he is also the ultimate\\nreality that transcends all opposites. Thus he is both happiness and\\nsuffering, birth and death, being and nonbeing. Like the Brahman of the\\nUpanishads, he is beyond duality, utterly beyond the constricting categories\\nof the things of this world. His true nature is beyond the reach of thought.\\nHe can only be known in the state of samadhi, where knower and known\\nbecome one.\\nArjuna calls Krishna Purushottama, “the supreme Purusha, the supreme\\nPerson.” Krishna is now no human charioteer but Bhagavan, “the\\nmunificent Lord”; and Arjuna, leaving his warrior persona behind, now\\nstands revealed as a seeker after truth. At Arjuna’s request, Krishna now\\nreveals a few of his divine powers and attributes (vibhutis).\\nFrom this point on the chapter becomes difficult because of the many\\nunfamiliar names that are mentioned. In whatever category, Krishna is the\\nchief, the best, the most intense, the most beautiful, the most awesome, the\\nessence. Many of the allusions will be familiar – for example, among rivers\\nKrishna is the Ganges. But many of the names come from Hindu mythology\\nand are not well known. There is no room here to explain every name, but\\nthe following paragraphs will highlight a few of importance.\\nFirst, Krishna is the Atman, the inner Self in all beings. It is fitting that\\nthis be mentioned first, for of all his myriad manifestations this is the most\\nimportant, at least to the struggling spiritual aspirant that is Arjuna. Krishna\\nis Arjuna’s innermost Self, and that is how he is to be known in\\ncontemplation. Of all the forms in which to meditate upon Krishna, the\\nAtman is mentioned first.\\nKrishna is Vishnu, the great compassionate, sustaining God of the Hindu\\nfaith. It is Vishnu who cares so much about the sufferings of Mother Earth\\nand her children that he comes to earth again and again, in age after age, to\\nrelieve oppression and renew righteousness.\\n\\n\\x0cKrishna is the sun, worshipped in India since ancient times. He is Indra,\\nthe chief of the Vedic gods, the lord of storm and battle, who hurls the\\nthunderbolt against the enemies of the gods. In Vedic religion he is a mighty\\nlord, not to be trifled with, but later on he must admit defeat at the hands of\\nKrishna, who protects the people from Indra’s stormy wrath.\\nKrishna is also Shankara, the more beneficent aspect of the awesome\\ndeity Rudra, better known as Shiva. Among mountains Krishna is Meru, the\\nhigh mountain home of Shiva and the other gods, the highest peak and\\ncenter of the world. Krishna is consciousness, the syllable Om, and the\\nmantram or holy name. He is the mythic horse and the fabulous elephant\\nthat were produced when the cosmic ocean was churned for the elixir of\\nimmortality.\\nKrishna is Ananta, the cosmic serpent on which Lord Vishnu sleeps. He\\nis Varuna, Vedic god of the oceans, and Yama, the god of death; among\\ndemons (asuras) he is Prahlada, who, though born in the race of demons,\\nwas devoted to God and never swayed in his love, even when his own\\nfather tried to kill him. And of course Krishna is Rama, the great warriorprince – also an incarnation of Vishnu – whose exploits are told in the\\nimmortal epic, the Ramayana.\\nOf all fields of knowledge, Krishna says, he is knowledge of the Self.\\nThe study of Sanskrit and its grammar were important in ancient India, and\\nKrishna doesn’t neglect this field. He is A among letters; among compound\\nwords he is the dvandva, which joins equals. He is the Gayatri – a particular\\nmeter found in the poetry of the Vedas, but generally taken to be a famous\\nprayer from the Rig Veda (iii.62.10) composed in that meter, which has\\nbeen chanted every morning by countless worshippers for three thousand\\nyears.\\nIt is fitting that among seasons Krishna is the spring, the season of\\nflowers. Less easily understood is his claim to be the gambling of gamblers.\\nKrishna has a sense of play, and as gambling is the obsession of the\\ngambler, it seems natural that Krishna might claim this as a vibhuti. Also, in\\nancient India gambling was considered a royal pastime, and no king of\\nrepute would refuse a friendly game of dice.\\nIn the human realm, Krishna is the “son of Vasudeva,” a prince of the\\nVrishni line – in other words, the human form that is Arjuna’s friend and\\ncharioteer. He is also Arjuna! And he is Vyasa, the composer of the Gita –\\nindeed, of the whole Mahabharata.\\n\\n\\x0cWherever Arjuna finds strength, beauty, or power, Krishna concludes, he\\nshould recognize it as coming from a spark of Krishna’s glory. Then, after\\noverwhelming Arjuna with this stupendous list of divine powers and\\nrevelations, Krishna asks casually, “But what use is it to know all of these\\ndetails? The important fact is to know that I am, and that a tiny portion of\\nmy being supports all things.” –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c10: Divine Splendor\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nListen further, Arjuna, to my supreme teaching, which gives you\\nsuch joy. Desiring your welfare, O strong-armed warrior, I will tell\\nyou more.\\n1\\n\\nNeither gods nor sages know my origin, for I am the source from\\nwhich the gods and sages come. 3 Whoever knows me as the Lord\\nof all creation, without birth or beginning, knows the truth and frees\\nhimself from all evil.\\n2\\n\\nDiscrimination, wisdom, understanding, forgiveness, truth, selfcontrol, and peace of mind; pleasure and pain, birth and death, fear\\nand courage, honor and dishonor; 5 nonviolence, charity,\\nequanimity, contentment, and perseverance in spiritual disciplines –\\nall the different qualities found in living creatures have their source\\nin me.\\n4\\n\\nThe seven great sages and the four ancient ancestors were born\\nfrom my mind and received my power. From them came all the\\ncreatures of this world. 7 Whoever understands my power and the\\nmystery of my manifestations comes without doubt to be united\\nwith me.\\n6\\n\\nI am the source from which all creatures evolve. The wise\\nremember this and worship me with loving devotion. 9 Their\\nthoughts are all absorbed in me, and all their vitality flows to me.\\nTeaching one another, talking about me always, they are happy and\\nfulfilled.\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cTo those steadfast in love and devotion I give spiritual wisdom, so\\nthat they may come to me. 11 Out of compassion I destroy the\\ndarkness of their ignorance. From within them I light the lamp of\\nwisdom and dispel all darkness from their lives.\\n10\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nYou are Brahman supreme, the highest abode, the supreme\\npurifier, the self-luminous, eternal spirit, first among the gods,\\nunborn and infinite. 13 The great sages and seers – Narada, Asita,\\nDevala, and Vyasa too – have acclaimed you thus; now you have\\ndeclared it to me yourself.\\n12\\n\\nNow, O Krishna, I believe that everything you have told me is\\ndivine truth. O Lord, neither gods nor demons know your real\\nnature. 15 Indeed, you alone know yourself, O supreme spirit. You\\nare the source of being and the master of every creature, God of\\ngods, the Lord of the universe.\\n14\\n\\nTell me all your divine attributes, leaving nothing unsaid. Tell me\\nof the glories with which you fill the cosmos. 17 Krishna, you are a\\nsupreme master of yoga. Tell me how I should meditate to gain\\nconstant awareness of you. In what things and in what ways should I\\nmeditate on you? 18 O Krishna, you who stir up people’s hearts, tell\\nme in detail your attributes and your powers; I can never tire of\\nhearing your immortal words.\\n16\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nAll right, Arjuna, I will tell you of my divine powers. I will\\nmention only the most glorious; for there is no end to them.\\n19\\n\\nI am the true Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the\\nbeginning, middle, and end of their existence.\\n20\\n\\nAmong the shining gods I am Vishnu; of luminaries I am the sun;\\namong the storm gods I am Marichi, and in the night sky I am the\\nmoon.\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cAmong scriptures I am the Sama Veda, and among the lesser gods\\nI am Indra. Among the senses I am the mind, and in living beings I\\nam consciousness.\\n22\\n\\nAmong the Rudras I am Shankara. Among the spirits of the\\nnatural world I am Kubera, god of wealth, and Pavaka, the purifying\\nfire. Among mountains I am Meru.\\n23\\n\\nAmong priests I am Brihaspati, and among military leaders I am\\nSkanda. Among bodies of water I am the ocean.\\n24\\n\\nAmong the great seers I am Bhrigu, and among words, the\\nsyllable Om; I am the repetition of the holy name, and among\\nmountains I am the Himalayas.\\n25\\n\\nAmong trees I am the ashvattha, the sacred fig; among the\\ngandharvas, the heavenly musicians, I am Chitraratha. Among\\ndivine seers I am Narada, and among sages I am Kapila.\\n26\\n\\nI was born from the nectar of immortality as the primordial horse\\nand as Indra’s noble elephant. Among human beings, I am the king.\\n27\\n\\nAmong weapons I am the thunderbolt. I am Kamadhuk, the cow\\nthat fulfills all desires; I am Kandarpa, the power of sex, and Vasuki,\\nthe king of snakes.\\n28\\n\\nI am Ananta, the cosmic serpent, and Varuna, the god of water; I\\nam Aryaman among the noble ancestors. Among the forces which\\nrestrain I am Yama, the god of death.\\n29\\n\\nAmong animals I am the lion; among birds, the eagle Garuda. I\\nam Prahlada, born among the demons, and of all that measures, I am\\ntime.\\n30\\n\\nAmong purifying forces I am the wind; among warriors, Rama.\\nOf water creatures I am the crocodile, and of rivers I am the Ganges.\\n31\\n\\n\\x0cI am the beginning, middle, and end of creation. Of all the\\nsciences I am the science of Self-knowledge, and I am logic in those\\nwho debate. 33 Among letters I am A; among grammatical\\ncompounds I am the dvandva. I am infinite time, and the sustainer\\nwhose face is seen everywhere.\\n32\\n\\nI am death, which overcomes all, and the source of all beings still\\nto be born. I am the feminine qualities: fame, beauty, perfect speech,\\nmemory, intelligence, loyalty, and forgiveness.\\n34\\n\\nAmong the hymns of the Sama Veda I am the Brihat; among\\npoetic meters, the Gayatri. Among months I am Margashirsha, first\\nof the year; among seasons I am spring, that brings forth flowers.\\n35\\n\\nI am the gambling of the gambler and the radiance in all that\\nshines. I am effort, I am victory, and I am the goodness of the\\nvirtuous.\\n36\\n\\nAmong the Vrishnis I am Krishna, and among the Pandavas I am\\nArjuna. Among sages I am Vyasa, and among poets, Ushanas.\\n37\\n\\nI am the scepter which metes out punishment, and the art of\\nstatesmanship in those who lead. I am the silence of the unknown\\nand the wisdom of the wise.\\n38\\n\\nI am the seed that can be found in every creature, Arjuna; for\\nwithout me nothing can exist, neither animate nor inanimate.\\n39\\n\\nBut there is no end to my divine attributes, Arjuna; these I have\\nmentioned are only a few. 41 Wherever you find strength, or beauty,\\nor spiritual power, you may be sure that these have sprung from a\\nspark of my essence.\\n40\\n\\nBut of what use is it to you to know all this, Arjuna? Just\\nremember that I am, and that I support the entire cosmos with only a\\nfragment of my being.\\n42\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Eleven\\n\\nThe Cosmic Vision\\nThis is the most exalted chapter of the entire Gita, for here Arjuna sees the\\ndivine vision of Krishna in his full nature as God himself, Lord of the\\nUniverse. It is difficult to see at first why the ultimate spiritual vision\\nshould be granted to Arjuna at this point. We must remember that Krishna\\nand Arjuna have been companions for many lives. Yet at the opening of the\\nGita, Arjuna is a warrior, little concerned with mystic visions. Step by step\\nKrishna has led him to an understanding of the real purpose of his life – to\\nknow who he is and to know also who Krishna is. In the last chapter,\\nKrishna had reached the point where he was willing to reveal to Arjuna the\\nmanifestations of divine power. Arjuna had not only asked about those\\npowers, but had even wanted to know in which forms he might meditate on\\nKrishna – the first time Arjuna had spoken of contemplation.\\nNow, in chapter 11, Arjuna asks to see Krishna as He really is. His desire\\nis granted, and in essence the rest of the chapter describes Arjuna’s\\nsamadhi. Samadhi is the word used by Patanjali in his classic work, the\\nYoga Sutras, to describe the final stage in meditation, in which the mind is\\ncompletely concentrated and a superconscious mode of knowing comes into\\nplay. Patanjali speaks of many different kinds of samadhi, but for practical\\npurposes we may speak of two: savikalpa and nirvikalpa. Arjuna’s vision\\nbegins with savikalpa samadhi, in which he sees God in a personal\\nmanifestation. Then, as he passes into nirvikalpa samadhi, Arjuna sees all\\nforms disappearing into God, until only a supernatural fire consuming the\\nentire phenomenal world is left.\\nThis supreme vision dazzles Arjuna with the blinding splendor of a\\nthousand suns. Mystics have often described their experiences in terms of\\nlight. In an ancient prayer of the Veda, the poet asks for divine wisdom to\\ndawn in his heart just as the sun rises in the sky. And in the West we have\\ncountless testimonies like that of St. Teresa of Avila:\\nWhen the soul looks upon this Divine Sun, the brightness dazzles it. . . .\\nAnd very often it remains completely blind, absorbed, amazed, and\\ndazzled by all the wonders it sees.\\n\\n\\x0cAs this vision begins to unfold, Arjuna sees the whole world in the body\\nof Krishna and he begins a hymn of praise. He sees Krishna as Vishnu with\\nhis traditional weapons, the mace and the discus, and wearing a crown.\\nAs the vision becomes more intense, Arjuna begins to feel afraid. He sees\\nthe light of God become a fire that burns to consume all things, as if at the\\nend of time. All the warriors on the battlefield are mortals, and Arjuna sees\\nthem slain, burning in the universal fire. All creatures rush to destruction\\nlike moths into a flame. God’s radiance is both a great light and a burning\\nfire.\\nTerrified, Arjuna wants to know the identity of this awesome God, who\\nbears no resemblance now to the Krishna he had known as his teacher and\\nfriend. In answer to the question, “Who are you?” Krishna’s reply is the\\nverse (11:32) that burst into Robert Oppenheimer’s mind when he saw the\\natomic bomb explode over Trinity in the summer of 1945: “I am become\\nDeath, the shatterer of worlds. . . .” But the word kala means not just death\\nbut time, which eventually devours all.\\nArjuna is brave, and worthy of this vision, for he does not lose\\nconsciousness or completely break down. He praises Krishna and then asks\\nfor forgiveness if during their long friendship he has ever said or done\\nanything to offend the Lord through mistaking him for a mere human being.\\nFinally, the vision is too much for Arjuna. Though he experiences the deep\\npeace and joy of samadhi, he is terrified at the same time. He wishes to see\\nthe more human face of God.\\nKrishna grants his desire and returns to his gentle, normal aspect. He tells\\nArjuna how very difficult it is to see him in his exalted form as the Lord of\\nYoga, the God of gods. Only pure devotion attains this vision. This theme\\ndominates the remaining chapters of the Gita: it is devotion that is allimportant on the spiritual quest. – D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c11: The Cosmic Vision\\nARJUNA\\n\\nOut of compassion you have taught me the supreme mystery of the\\nSelf. Through your words my delusion is gone. 2 You have\\nexplained the origin and end of every creature, O lotus-eyed one,\\nand told me of your own supreme, limitless existence.\\n1\\n\\nJust as you have described your infinite glory, O Lord, now I long\\nto see it. I want to see you as the supreme ruler of creation. 4 O\\nLord, master of yoga, if you think me strong enough to behold it,\\nshow me your immortal Self.\\n3\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nBehold, Arjuna, a million divine forms, with an infinite variety of\\ncolor and shape. 6 Behold the gods of the natural world, and many\\nmore wonders never revealed before. 7 Behold the entire cosmos\\nturning within my body, and the other things you desire to see.\\n5\\n\\nBut these things cannot be seen with your physical eyes; therefore\\nI give you spiritual vision to perceive my majestic power.\\n8\\n\\nSANJAYA\\n\\nHaving spoken these words, Krishna, the master of yoga, revealed\\nto Arjuna his most exalted, lordly form.\\n9\\n\\nHe appeared with an infinite number of faces, ornamented by\\nheavenly jewels, displaying unending miracles and the countless\\nweapons of his power. 11 Clothed in celestial garments and covered\\nwith garlands, sweet-smelling with heavenly fragrances, he showed\\n10\\n\\n\\x0chimself as the infinite Lord, the source of all wonders, whose face is\\neverywhere.\\nIf a thousand suns were to rise in the heavens at the same time,\\nthe blaze of their light would resemble the splendor of that supreme\\nspirit.\\n12\\n\\nThere, within the body of the God of gods, Arjuna saw all the\\nmanifold forms of the universe united as one. 14 Filled with\\namazement, his hair standing on end in ecstasy, he bowed before the\\nLord with joined palms and spoke these words.\\n13\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Lord, I see within your body all the gods and every kind of\\nliving creature. I see Brahma, the Creator, seated on a lotus; I see\\nthe ancient sages and the celestial serpents.\\n15\\n\\nI see infinite mouths and arms, stomachs and eyes, and you are\\nembodied in every form. I see you everywhere, without beginning,\\nmiddle, or end. You are the Lord of all creation, and the cosmos is\\nyour body.\\n16\\n\\nYou wear a crown and carry a mace and discus; your radiance is\\nblinding and immeasurable. I see you, who are so difficult to\\nbehold, shining like a fiery sun blazing in every direction.\\n17\\n\\nYou are the supreme, changeless Reality, the one thing to be\\nknown. You are the refuge of all creation, the immortal spirit, the\\neternal guardian of eternal dharma.\\n18\\n\\nYou are without beginning, middle, or end; you touch everything\\nwith your infinite power. The sun and moon are your eyes, and your\\nmouth is fire; your radiance warms the cosmos.\\n19\\n\\nO Lord, your presence fills the heavens and the earth and reaches\\nin every direction. I see the three worlds trembling before this vision\\nof your wonderful and terrible form.\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cThe gods enter your being, some calling out and greeting you in\\nfear. Great saints sing your glory, praying, “May all be well!”\\n21\\n\\nThe multitudes of gods, demigods, and demons are all\\noverwhelmed by the sight of you. 23 O mighty Lord, at the sight of\\nyour myriad eyes and mouths, arms and legs, stomachs and fearful\\nteeth, I and the entire universe shake in terror.\\n22\\n\\nO Vishnu, I can see your eyes shining; with open mouth, you\\nglitter in an array of colors, and your body touches the sky. I look at\\nyou and my heart trembles; I have lost all courage and all peace of\\nmind.\\n24\\n\\nWhen I see your mouths with their fearful teeth, mouths burning\\nlike the fires at the end of time, I forget where I am and I have no\\nplace to go. O Lord, you are the support of the universe; have mercy\\non me!\\n25\\n\\nI see all the sons of Dhritarashtra; I see Bhishma, Drona, and\\nKarna; I see our warriors and all the kings who are here to fight. 27\\nAll are rushing into your awful jaws; I see some of them crushed by\\nyour teeth. 28 As rivers flow into the ocean, all the warriors of this\\nworld are passing into your fiery jaws; 29 all creatures rush to their\\ndestruction like moths into a flame.\\n26\\n\\nYou lap the worlds into your burning mouths and swallow them.\\nFilled with your terrible radiance, O Vishnu, the whole of creation\\nbursts into flames.\\n30\\n\\nTell me who you are, O Lord of terrible form. I bow before you;\\nhave mercy! I want to know who you are, you who existed before\\nall creation. Your nature and workings confound me.\\n31\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nI am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world.\\nEven without your participation, all the warriors gathered here will\\ndie.\\n32\\n\\n\\x0cTherefore arise, Arjuna; conquer your enemies and enjoy the\\nglory of sovereignty. I have already slain all these warriors; you will\\nonly be my instrument.\\n33\\n\\nBhishma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna, and many others are already\\nslain. Kill those whom I have killed. Do not hesitate. Fight in this\\nbattle and you will conquer your enemies.\\n34\\n\\nSANJAYA\\n\\nHaving heard these words, Arjuna trembled in fear. With joined\\npalms he bowed before Krishna and addressed him stammering.\\n35\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, it is right that the world delights and rejoices in your\\npraise, that all the saints and sages bow down to you and all evil\\nflees before you to the far corners of the universe.\\n36\\n\\nHow could they not worship you, O Lord? You are the eternal\\nspirit, who existed before Brahma the Creator and who will never\\ncease to be. Lord of the gods, you are the abode of the universe.\\nChangeless, you are what is and what is not, and beyond the duality\\nof existence and nonexistence.\\n37\\n\\nYou are the first among the gods, the timeless spirit, the resting\\nplace of all beings. You are the knower and the thing which is\\nknown. You are the final home; with your infinite form you pervade\\nthe cosmos.\\n38\\n\\nYou are Vayu, god of wind; Yama, god of death; Agni, god of\\nfire; Varuna, god of water. You are the moon and the creator\\nPrajapati, and the great-grandfather of all creatures. I bow before\\nyou and salute you again and again.\\n39\\n\\nYou are behind me and in front of me; I bow to you on every side.\\nYour power is immeasurable. You pervade everything; you are\\neverything.\\n40\\n\\n\\x0cSometimes, because we were friends, I rashly said, “Oh, Krishna!\\nSay, friend!” – casual, careless remarks. Whatever I may have said\\nlightly, whether we were playing or resting, alone or in company,\\nsitting together or eating, 42 if it was disrespectful, forgive me for it,\\nO Krishna. I did not know the greatness of your nature, unchanging\\nand imperishable.\\n41\\n\\nYou are the father of the universe, of the animate and the\\ninanimate; you are the object of all worship, the greatest guru. There\\nis none to equal you in the three worlds. Who can match your\\npower? 44 O gracious Lord, I prostrate myself before you and ask\\nfor your blessing. As a father forgives his son, or a friend a friend,\\nor a lover his beloved, so should you forgive me.\\n43\\n\\nI rejoice in seeing you as you have never been seen before, yet I\\nam filled with fear by this vision of you as the abode of the\\nuniverse. Please let me see you again as the shining God of gods. 46\\nThough you are the embodiment of all creation, let me see you\\nagain not with a thousand arms but with four, carrying the mace and\\ndiscus and wearing a crown.\\n45\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nArjuna, through my grace you have been united with me and\\nreceived this vision of my radiant, universal form, without\\nbeginning or end, which no one else has ever seen.\\n47\\n\\nNot by knowledge of the Vedas, nor sacrifice, nor charity, nor\\nrituals, nor even by severe asceticism has any other mortal seen\\nwhat you have seen, O heroic Arjuna.\\n48\\n\\nDo not be troubled; do not fear my terrible form. Let your heart\\nbe satisfied and your fears dispelled in looking at me as I was\\nbefore.\\n49\\n\\nSANJAYA\\n\\nHaving spoken these words, the Lord once again assumed the\\ngentle form of Krishna and consoled his devotee, who had been so\\n50\\n\\n\\x0cafraid.\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, now that I have seen your gentle human form my\\nmind is again composed and returned to normal.\\n51\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nIt is extremely difficult to obtain the vision you have had; even\\nthe gods long always to see me in this aspect. 53 Neither knowledge\\nof the Vedas, nor austerity, nor charity, nor sacrifice can bring the\\nvision you have seen. 54 But through unfailing devotion, Arjuna,\\nyou can know me, see me, and attain union with me. 55 Those who\\nmake me the supreme goal of all their work and act without selfish\\nattachment, who devote themselves to me completely and are free\\nfrom ill will for any creature, enter into me.\\n52\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Twelve\\n\\nThe Way of Love\\nThis short chapter focuses upon the supreme importance of devotion and\\nfaith in spiritual development. Here love, or personal devotion, is the most\\npowerful motivation in spiritual life.\\nThe world’s great religions agree on this point. All religions allow for a\\nway of devotion, and millions of men and women have found spiritual\\nfulfillment in devotion to Christ, the Buddha, or Muhammad. Hinduism has\\nallowed a place for the path of knowledge as well as the path of devotion;\\nhere, however, the Gita stresses the efficacy of devotion.\\nThe Upanishads, the final word on mystic experience uttered by the\\nVedas, stressed the ultimate reality, the eternal truth behind the ephemeral\\nthings of this world. The teachers of the Upanishads told their students to\\nseek knowledge of the Atman, their true Self. The consummation of this\\nknowledge was to know that the Self within was one with Brahman, the\\nultimate reality pervading all things. This was encapsulated in the statement\\nTat tvam asi, “You are that” – that imperishable being, that immortal\\nReality. Brahman, the nameless, formless Godhead, could be known only in\\nthe superconscious state.\\nThe Gita moves away from such an approach to religion. For as Krishna\\nsays, seeking an eternal, indefinable, hidden Godhead is rather a tall order\\nfor the average (or even above average) person. In fact, in this chapter it is\\nsaid to be beyond the reach of practically all “embodied beings” (dehavat,\\n“those who have bodies”). This path of wisdom may be just too “spiritual”\\nfor earth’s children, because those who identify to a large degree with their\\nphysical nature find the way of knowledge too steep a climb. We can turn to\\none of the Western followers of this path to see why; this is Dionysius the\\nAreopagite, a Christian monk of the fifth century, sounding remarkably like\\nverses 3–4 of this very chapter:\\nThen, beyond all distinction between knower and known, the aspirant\\nbecomes merged in the nameless, formless Reality, wholly absorbed in\\nThat which is beyond all things and in nothing else. . . . Having stilled\\n\\n\\x0chis intellect and mind, he is united by his highest faculty with That\\nwhich is beyond all knowing.\\nFortunately there is the path of love; for when God is loved in personal\\naspect, the way is vastly easier. According to the Hindu scriptures, God can\\nbe loved as a merciful father, a divine mother, a wise friend, a passionate\\nbeloved, or even as a mischievous child.\\nWe might turn to the Christian mystics for help here, for most of them\\nhave walked the way of love. The medieval Christian work called The\\nCloud of Unknowing states that love is the sure, safe path to God: “By love\\nHe can be gotten and holden, by thought never.” In a well-known passage in\\nthe New Testament, St. Paul puts love above knowledge and even above\\nmiraculous powers: “But I shall give you a more excellent way. . . . Love\\nnever faileth. But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. Whether\\nthere be tongues, they shall cease. Whether there be knowledge, it shall\\nvanish away.” And St. John of the Cross tells concisely why the vast\\nmajority of human beings find it easier to overcome their weaknesses\\nthrough love than through knowledge:\\nIn order to overcome our desires and to renounce all those things, our\\nlove and inclination for which are wont to inflame the will that it\\ndelights therein, we require a more ardent fire and a nobler love – that\\nof the Bridegroom. . . . if our spiritual nature were not on fire with other\\nand nobler passions, we should never cast off the yoke of the senses.\\nBut such love is often not forthcoming in the struggling soul, even in one\\nlike Arjuna. So Krishna says that if Arjuna is not able to focus his devotion,\\nhe should learn to do so through the regular practice of meditation. Even\\nlove and devotion can be cultivated through regular practice; they needn’t\\nbe regarded as mysterious forces, divine gifts of the spirit.\\nIf even the attempt at regular practice should fail, Krishna is still not\\nready to let Arjuna admit defeat. He should, Krishna says, work selflessly\\nwithout desire for the fruits of his labors. But real peace of mind comes\\nonly from renunciation. The word tyaga here seems to mean renunciation or\\nabandonment of self-will more than anything else. Such self-surrender may\\nbe a last resort, but if it is genuine it brings immediate peace.\\n\\n\\x0cVerses 13–20 describe the characteristics of the genuine lover of God.\\nSuch a saintly person, Krishna points out, is greatly loved and dear to\\nKrishna himself. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c12: The Way of Love\\nARJUNA\\n\\nOf those steadfast devotees who love you and those who seek you\\nas the eternal formless Reality, who are the more established in\\nyoga?\\n1\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nThose who set their hearts on me and worship me with unfailing\\ndevotion and faith are more established in yoga.\\n2\\n\\nAs for those who seek the transcendental Reality, without name,\\nwithout form, contemplating the Unmanifested, beyond the reach of\\nthought and of feeling, 4 with their senses subdued and mind serene\\nand striving for the good of all beings, they too will verily come\\nunto me.\\n3\\n\\nYet hazardous and slow is the path to the Unrevealed, difficult for\\nphysical creatures to tread. 6 But they for whom I am the supreme\\ngoal, who do all work renouncing self for me and meditate on me\\nwith single-hearted devotion, 7 these I will swiftly rescue from the\\nfragment’s cycle of birth and death, for their consciousness has\\nentered into me.\\n5\\n\\nStill your mind in me, still your intellect in me, and without doubt\\nyou will be united with me forever. 9 If you cannot still your mind in\\nme, learn to do so through the regular practice of meditation. 10 If\\nyou lack the will for such self-discipline, engage yourself in my\\nwork, for selfless service can lead you at last to complete\\nfulfillment. 11 If you are unable to do even this, surrender yourself to\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cme, disciplining yourself and renouncing the results of all your\\nactions.\\nBetter indeed is knowledge than mechanical practice. Better than\\nknowledge is meditation. But better still is surrender of attachment\\nto results, because there follows immediate peace.\\n12\\n\\nThat one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and\\ncompassionate. Living beyond the reach of “I” and “mine” and of\\npleasure and pain, 14 patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in\\nfaith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me – with such\\nas these I am in love.\\n13\\n\\nNot agitating the world or by it agitated, they stand above the\\nsway of elation, competition, and fear: that one is my beloved.\\n15\\n\\nThey are detached, pure, efficient, impartial, never anxious,\\nselfless in all their undertakings; they are my devotees, very dear to\\nme.\\n16\\n\\nThat one is dear to me who runs not after the pleasant or away\\nfrom the painful, grieves not, lusts not, but lets things come and go\\nas they happen.\\n17\\n\\nThat devotee who looks upon friend and foe with equal regard,\\nwho is not buoyed up by praise nor cast down by blame, alike in\\nheat and cold, pleasure and pain, free from selfish attachments, 19\\nthe same in honor and dishonor, quiet, ever full, in harmony\\neverywhere, firm in faith – such a one is dear to me.\\n18\\n\\nThose who meditate upon this immortal dharma as I have\\ndeclared it, full of faith and seeking me as life’s supreme goal, are\\ntruly my devotees, and my love for them is very great.\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Thirteen\\n\\nThe Field & the Knower\\nThis chapter presents us with two sweeping categories: the “field” and the\\n“knower of the field.” To simplify, we may think of the field as the body\\nand the knower of the field as the Self that resides in the body. This chapter,\\nthen, is about the duality between “soul and body.” This duality is seen as\\neternal, a basic division of all things – a fundamental concept elaborated in\\nSankhya philosophy.\\nWe said that the “field” is the body, but this is not precise enough. The\\nfield also includes the mind: in fact, it comprises all the components of\\nprakriti including ahamkara – the awareness each of us has that we are an\\nindividual ego, from aham “I” and kara “maker.” Ahamkara is the basic\\nawareness of separateness: that which makes me “I,” a being separate from\\nthe rest of creation. In this wide sense the field encompasses everything,\\nexcept for the elusive consciousness that “knows” the field. The field is the\\nobject; the knower is the subject. Krishna is the hidden knower of the field:\\nthat is, the Self.\\nThis term “field” is a surprisingly modern one, for it describes what\\ntoday we might call an extension of the continuum of mass, energy, time,\\nand space to include the strata of mind as well – in other words, a field of\\nforces both physical and mental. Just as physics no longer regards matter\\nand energy as essentially separate, the Gita would not regard matter and\\nmind as separate; they are different aspects of prakriti, the underlying\\n“stuff” of existence.\\nAnother dimension of Krishna’s use of the word “field” is brought out by\\na traditional Hindu anecdote. A wandering sadhu or holy man is asked what\\nhis work in life is; he replies, “I’m a farmer.” When the questioner looks\\nsurprised he adds, “This body of mine is my field. I sow good thoughts and\\nactions, and in my body I reap the results.” The Buddha explains, “All that\\nwe are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts;\\nit is made of our thoughts.” What we think, we become, for as Emerson\\nsays, the ancestor of every action is a thought. Thus our thoughts, taken\\ntogether, bear fruit in the actions, decisions, and desires that shape our lives.\\nIn part, the body bears the fruit of what we think insofar as our way of\\n\\n\\x0cthinking affects our health and safety. But in a larger sense, the whole field\\nof human activity (indeed the whole of prakriti) is also a “field of karma” –\\nwhere, for example, the global environment is shaped by the sum of what\\nits inhabitants do, which in turn is shaped by how they think. This idea will\\nbe picked up and elaborated on in detail in the concluding chapters of the\\nGita.\\nVerses 7–11 then describe the person who understands his or her own\\ntrue nature. This is an attractive picture of the modest, truly wise person\\nwho is in control of his or her own life. One implication of these verses is\\nthat it is quite an achievement to understand the difference between the field\\nand the Self, the knower. Most people confuse the two, taking the body and\\nmind to be who they are. In the usual course of events, we may be totally\\nunaware that there is a Self, a consciousness underneath the surface\\nawareness of a separate “I.” Verses 12–17 describe the ultimate underlying\\nreality: Brahman, pure, undifferentiated consciousness, the divine ground of\\nexistence.\\nVerse 19 returns us to the discussion of the basic duality of mind/matter\\nand spirit (Self). Again the technical terms prakriti and Purusha are used.\\nPurusha is the knower and prakriti the field. From the union of these two all\\nthings are born. Both prakriti and Purusha are essential to the creation of the\\nworld: nothing could exist without the spiritual basis of Purusha, and\\nnothing could develop in a manifest form without the mind and matter of\\nprakriti.\\nWith its need to think of abstract principles in human terms, Hinduism\\nembodies these two eternal principles in the figures of Shiva and Shakti, the\\ndivine Father and Mother. The Gita does not mention these two because it\\ncomes essentially from the Vishnu tradition, but in the other great stream of\\nthe Hindu faith, Shiva is the eternal Spirit, the Absolute, represented as\\ndwelling aloof on the mountain peak of spiritual peace. Shakti, the Divine\\nMother, is his creative partner, and without her, Shiva could never have\\ncreated the world. Shakti – she has many names in her various\\nmanifestations – rules in the realm of birth and death; Shiva, Purusha, lives\\nin the realm of the immortal. Together the two represent Brahman, the\\nattributeless Godhead, and the creative power of the Godhead called maya.\\nThus it is in the union of Shiva and Shakti that all things are born.\\nThis chapter emphasizes that the Self, the real knower, is ever uninvolved\\nin the shifting forces that play over the field. There is no possibility of any\\n\\n\\x0csoul being eternally lost, for all beings partake of the immortal, pure nature\\nof Purusha. We may endure countless eons of birth and death, but we must\\nfinally find our rest in the eternal spirit. By definition, nothing taking place\\nin the realm of prakriti can affect Purusha; but the exact nature of the\\ninteraction of these two is a profound mystery.\\nVerse 32 explains this mystery by drawing a comparison with akasha, the\\nsubtlest element recognized by the ancient philosophers. Akasha is space\\nitself. Just as space pervades the cosmos, yet remains pure even in the midst\\nof impure things, so the Self remains completely pure, even though it\\ndwells in all things. Though it seems to live in the land of mortals and to\\nundergo change and death, the real knower in every creature is deathless,\\n“hidden in the heart.” –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c13: The Field & the Knower\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nThe body is called a field, Arjuna; the one who knows it is called\\nthe Knower of the field. This is the knowledge of those who know. 2\\nI am the Knower of the field in everyone, Arjuna. Knowledge of the\\nfield and its Knower is true knowledge.\\n1\\n\\nListen and I will explain the nature of the field and how change\\ntakes place within it. I will also describe the Knower of the field and\\nhis power. 4 These truths have been sung by great sages in a variety\\nof ways, and expounded in precise arguments concerning Brahman.\\n3\\n\\nThe field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of\\nsense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the\\nfive organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas,\\nbuddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy from which\\nall these evolved. 6 In this field arise desire and aversion, pleasure\\nand pain, the body, intelligence, and will.\\n5\\n\\nThose who know truly are free from pride and deceit. They are\\ngentle, forgiving, upright, and pure, devoted to their spiritual\\nteacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled. 8 Detached\\nfrom sense objects and self-will, they have learned the painful\\nlesson of separate birth and suffering, old age, disease, and death.\\n7\\n\\nFree from selfish attachment, they do not get compulsively\\nentangled even in home and family. They are even-minded through\\ngood fortune and bad. 10 Their devotion to me is undivided.\\nEnjoying solitude and not following the crowd, they seek only me.\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cThis is true knowledge, to seek the Self as the true end of wisdom\\nalways. To seek anything else is ignorance.\\n11\\n\\nI will tell you of the wisdom that leads to immortality: the\\nbeginningless Brahman, which can be called neither being nor nonbeing.\\n12\\n\\nIt dwells in all, in every hand and foot and head, in every mouth\\nand eye and ear in the universe. 14 Without senses itself, it shines\\nthrough the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it\\nsupports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play.\\n13\\n\\nIt is both near and far, both within and without every creature; it\\nmoves and is unmoving. 16 In its subtlety it is beyond\\ncomprehension. It is indivisible, yet appears divided in separate\\ncreatures. Know it to be the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer.\\n15\\n\\nDwelling in every heart, it is beyond darkness. It is called the\\nlight of light, the object and goal of knowledge, and knowledge\\nitself.\\n17\\n\\nI have revealed to you the nature of the field and the meaning and\\nobject of true knowledge. Those who are devoted to me, knowing\\nthese things, are united with me.\\n18\\n\\nKnow that prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning, and\\nthat from prakriti come the gunas and all that changes. 20 Prakriti is\\nthe agent, cause, and effect of every action, but it is Purusha that\\nseems to experience pleasure and pain.\\n19\\n\\nPurusha, resting in prakriti, witnesses the play of the gunas born\\nof prakriti. But attachment to the gunas leads a person to be born for\\ngood or evil.\\n21\\n\\nWithin the body the supreme Purusha is called the witness,\\napprover, supporter, enjoyer, the supreme Lord, the highest Self.\\n22\\n\\n\\x0cWhoever realizes the true nature of Purusha, prakriti, and the\\ngunas, whatever path he or she may follow, is not born separate\\nagain.\\n23\\n\\nSome realize the Self within them through the practice of\\nmeditation, some by the path of wisdom, and others by selfless\\nservice. 25 Others may not know these paths; but hearing and\\nfollowing the instructions of an illumined teacher, they too go\\nbeyond death.\\n24\\n\\nWhatever exists, Arjuna, animate or inanimate, is born through\\nthe union of the field and its Knower.\\n26\\n\\nThey alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature,\\nwho see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. 28 Seeing the same\\nLord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they\\nattain the supreme goal.\\n27\\n\\nThey alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by\\nprakriti, while the Self remains unmoved. 30 When they see the\\nvariety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they\\nattain fulfillment in Brahman.\\n29\\n\\nThis supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated,\\ndeathless. Though it dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is\\ntouched by action. 32 As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains\\nunstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every\\ncreature.\\n31\\n\\nAs the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the\\nsource of all light in the field. 34 Those who, with the eye of\\nwisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to\\nfreedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal.\\n33\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Fourteen\\n\\nThe Forces of Evolution\\nThe last chapter gave us the distinction between Purusha and prakriti. This\\nchapter will tell us in more detail about the nature of prakriti – the basis of\\nthe world of mind and matter. Here the Gita explains human experience in\\nterms of the three qualities of prakriti, known as gunas: sattva, rajas, and\\ntamas. When the soul attains illumination it goes beyond the confines of\\nprakriti into the spiritual realm of Purusha. But until then, the soul must\\nlearn to deal with these three all-powerful forces.\\nNo single English word can be given to translate the words sattva, rajas,\\nand tamas. The quality of sattva combines goodness, purity, light, harmony,\\nbalance. In terms of evolution, sattva is on the highest level. Rajas is energy\\n– or, on the human level, passion – which can be both good and bad. In\\npersonality rajas may express itself in anger, hatred, or greed; but it also\\nprovides motivation, the will to act. Rajas is ambitious, which is not\\naltogether a bad thing for the evolution of the soul. It is definitely superior\\nto the third guna, tamas, which combines inertia, sloth, darkness, ignorance,\\ninsensitivity. This is the lowest state in terms of evolution; for tamas means\\na dead stability, where nothing much happens for good or ill. Worse, tamas\\ncan mean not just stability but a sliding backwards in the struggle of\\nevolution, where to stand still may mean to be left behind (14:18).\\nIn any given personality or phenomenon all the three gunas are likely to\\nbe present. It is the mix of the three that colors our experience. Sattva may\\nbe dominant, with an admixture of rajas or tamas. Or perhaps rajas\\ndominates, with a little sattva and a good measure of tamas. Finally, the\\npersonality may be basically tamasic, with a few rays of the light of sattva\\nand a little of the heat of rajas. In any case, no mix of the three gunas is\\nstable, for it is the very nature of prakriti to be in constant flux. The gunas\\nare constantly shifting, always changing in intensity.\\nIt is essential that the gunas, even the purity and goodness of sattva, be\\ntranscended if the soul is to attain its final release. For the three gunas are\\nforces that operate within the world of prakriti: in fact, their three strands\\nmake up the whole fabric of the phenomenal world. Liberation lies beyond\\nthe conditioning of prakriti, in the realm of Purusha. When Arjuna asks\\n\\n\\x0cKrishna to describe the person who has gone beyond prakriti’s net, Krishna\\nreplies that such a person is detached from the constant shifting and\\ninteraction of the gunas. Identified with the Self, he or she realizes that the\\ngunas and their play are external – even the emotions and thoughts that\\nseem so personal, so interior, are really only the play of prakriti. Thoughts\\nand emotions, and ahamkara itself, stop at the gate of the inner Self. The\\nSelf abides in the inner chamber of the heart, always at peace, whatever\\nforces of prakriti may storm outside. The illumined man or woman\\nmaintains a joyful evenness of mind in happiness and sorrow.\\nAt the end of the chapter, again reminding him of the power of devotion\\n(bhakti), Krishna says that Arjuna can transcend the gunas through steadfast\\nlove. If he has devotion and has gone beyond the three gunas, then he will\\nbe fit to know Brahman. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c14: Forces of Evolution\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nLet me tell you more about the wisdom that transcends all\\nknowledge, through which the saints and sages attained perfection. 2\\nThose who rely on this wisdom will be united with me. For them\\nthere is neither rebirth nor fear of death.\\n1\\n\\nMy womb is prakriti; in that I place the seed. Thus all created\\nthings are born. 4 Everything born, Arjuna, comes from the womb of\\nprakriti, and I am the seed-giving father.\\n3\\n\\nIt is the three gunas born of prakriti – sattva, rajas, and tamas –\\nthat bind the immortal Self to the body. 6 Sattva – pure, luminous,\\nand free from sorrow – binds us with attachment to happiness and\\nwisdom. 7 Rajas is passion, arising from selfish desire and\\nattachment. These bind the Self with compulsive action. 8 Tamas,\\nborn of ignorance, deludes all creatures through heedlessness,\\nindolence, and sleep.\\n5\\n\\nSattva binds us to happiness; rajas binds us to action. Tamas,\\ndistorting our understanding, binds us to delusion.\\n9\\n\\nSattva predominates when rajas and tamas are transformed. Rajas\\nprevails when sattva is weak and tamas overcome. Tamas prevails\\nwhen rajas and sattva are dormant.\\n10\\n\\nWhen sattva predominates, the light of wisdom shines through\\nevery gate of the body. 12 When rajas predominates, a person runs\\nabout pursuing selfish and greedy ends, driven by restlessness and\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cdesire. 13 When tamas is dominant a person lives in darkness –\\nslothful, confused, and easily infatuated.\\nThose dying in the state of sattva attain the pure worlds of the\\nwise. 15 Those dying in rajas are reborn among people driven by\\nwork. But those who die in tamas are conceived in the wombs of the\\nignorant.\\n14\\n\\nThe fruit of good deeds is pure and sattvic. The fruit of rajas is\\nsuffering. The fruit of tamas is ignorance and insensitivity.\\n16\\n\\nFrom sattva comes understanding; from rajas, greed. But the\\noutcome of tamas is confusion, infatuation, and ignorance.\\n17\\n\\nThose who live in sattva go upwards; those in rajas remain where\\nthey are. But those immersed in tamas sink downwards.\\n18\\n\\nThe wise see clearly that all action is the work of the gunas.\\nKnowing that which is above the gunas, they enter into union with\\nme.\\n19\\n\\nGoing beyond the three gunas which form the body, they leave\\nbehind the cycle of birth and death, decrepitude and sorrow, and\\nattain to immortality.\\n20\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nWhat are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the\\ngunas, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the\\ngunas’ hold?\\n21\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nThey are unmoved by the harmony of sattva, the activity of rajas,\\nor the delusion of tamas. They feel no aversion when these forces\\nare active, nor do they crave for them when these forces subside.\\n22\\n\\nThey remain impartial, undisturbed by the actions of the gunas.\\nKnowing that it is the gunas which act, they abide within\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cthemselves and do not vacillate.\\nEstablished within themselves, they are equal in pleasure and\\npain, praise and blame, kindness and unkindness. Clay, a rock, and\\ngold are the same to them. 25 Alike in honor and dishonor, alike to\\nfriend and foe, they have given up every selfish pursuit. Such are\\nthose who have gone beyond the gunas.\\n24\\n\\nBy serving me with steadfast love, a man or woman goes beyond\\nthe gunas. Such a one is fit for union with Brahman. 27 For I am the\\nsupport of Brahman, the eternal, the unchanging, the deathless, the\\neverlasting dharma, the source of all joy.\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Fifteen\\n\\nThe Supreme Self\\nThis is a difficult chapter, for it deals essentially with questions of theology\\nand ultimate mystical experience.\\nKrishna reveals that he transcends not only the world of matter but also\\nthe immortal Atman that dwells as the conscious “knower” within all\\nbeings. Krishna has said that he is the Atman; but the paradox is that he also\\ntranscends the Atman. In this highest aspect Krishna is Ishvara, the cosmic\\nLord, who abides in his own mystery. The liberated Self enjoys union with\\nKrishna and lives in Krishna’s highest home. But the Self does not become\\nKrishna: the immortal soul, even when liberated from its mortal journeying,\\ndoes not become God.\\nThe chapter opens with the image of an upside-down tree, a world-tree\\nrooted in Brahman which branches out into a manifold creation in this\\nrealm below. This is said to be an ashvattha or pipal tree, a kind of fig. Like\\nthe banyan, it sends out roots into the air, spreading above and below.\\nIn this chapter about Krishna’s most exalted nature, it is appropriate that\\nhis “home,” the highest goal of all, is described. It is an abode of light and\\neternal life. By its very nature, it is beyond the description of human\\nlanguage. Verse 4 uses an elemental and ancient word for the ultimate\\nreality that defies all description, all human thought: Tat, which means\\nsimply “that” or “it.” Here the Gita personalizes Tat to the extent of giving\\nIt a home: avyayam padam, the immortal home, the eternal goal. Pada also\\nmeans foot or step, and it is of interest here to recall a myth from the Vedas.\\nAt the beginning of time Vishnu took three steps that measured out the\\nentire cosmos. The third and highest step became a heavenly world, the\\nrealm of the blessed. In the Rig Veda (I.154.5), the poet longs to find\\nhimself in this home of the god:\\nMay I go to his blessed world\\nWhere those who love the gods rejoice;\\nFor there, truly, is the company of the far-stepping god,\\nA fountain of honey in the highest step of Vishnu.\\n\\n\\x0cThe Gita describes Krishna’s home as a realm of light beyond the light of\\nthe sun (15:6). Here we might compare the Gita with the Katha Upanishad\\n(5:15):\\nThere shines not the sun, neither moon nor star,\\nNor flash of lightning, nor fire lit on earth.\\nThe Self is the light reflected by all.\\nHe shining, everything shines after him.\\nEven here, though, we are reminded that Krishna lives not just in this\\nhighest realm but also in the world below, where both darkness and light\\ncoexist. In his divine mystery he sends fragments of himself to become the\\ninner Self in each creature. In this sense the Self enters the body at\\nconception, dwells in the body, and then departs at death. Krishna is the\\nprana – the breath or vitality – of the body. The Upanishads speak of five\\npranas; here the Gita mentions the two most prominent: the prana by which\\nwe breathe and the prana that digests food. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c15: The Supreme Self\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nSages speak of the immutable ashvattha tree, with its taproot\\nabove and its branches below. On this tree grow the scriptures;\\nseeing their source, one knows their essence.\\n1\\n\\nNourished by the gunas, the limbs of this tree spread above and\\nbelow. Sense objects grow on the limbs as buds; the roots hanging\\ndown bind us to action in this world.\\n2\\n\\nThe true form of this tree – its essence, beginning, and end – is not\\nperceived on this earth. Cut down this strong-rooted tree with the\\nsharp ax of detachment; 4 then find the path which does not come\\nback again. Seek That, the First Cause, from which the universe\\ncame long ago.\\n3\\n\\nNot deluded by pride, free from selfish attachment and selfish\\ndesire, beyond the duality of pleasure and pain, ever aware of the\\nSelf, the wise go forward to that eternal goal. 6 Neither the sun nor\\nthe moon nor fire can add to that light. This is my supreme abode,\\nand those who enter there do not return to separate existence.\\n5\\n\\nAn eternal part of me enters into the world, assuming the powers\\nof action and perception and a mind made of prakriti. 8 When the\\ndivine Self enters and leaves a body, it takes these along as the wind\\ncarries a scent from place to place. 9 Using the mind, ears, eyes,\\nnose, and the senses of taste and touch, the Self enjoys sense\\nobjects.\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cThe deluded do not see the Self when it leaves the body or when\\nit dwells within it. They do not see the Self enjoying sense objects\\nor acting through the gunas. But they who have the eye of wisdom\\nsee.\\n10\\n\\nThose who strive resolutely on the path of yoga see the Self\\nwithin. The thoughtless, who strive imperfectly, do not.\\n11\\n\\nThe brightness of the sun, which lights up the world, the\\nbrightness of the moon and of fire – these are my glory. 13 With a\\ndrop of my energy I enter the earth and support all creatures.\\nThrough the moon, the vessel of life-giving fluid, I nourish all\\nplants. 14 I enter breathing creatures and dwell within as the lifegiving breath. I am the fire in the stomach which digests all food.\\n12\\n\\nEntering into every heart, I give the power to remember and\\nunderstand; it is I again who take that power away. All the scriptures\\nlead to me; I am their author and their wisdom.\\n15\\n\\nIn this world there are two orders of being: the perishable,\\nseparate creature and the changeless spirit. 17 But beyond these\\nthere is another, the supreme Self, the eternal Lord, who enters into\\nthe entire cosmos and supports it from within.\\n16\\n\\nI am that supreme Self, praised by the scriptures as beyond the\\nchanging and the changeless. 19 Those who see in me that supreme\\nSelf see truly. They have found the source of all wisdom, Arjuna,\\nand they worship me with all their heart.\\n18\\n\\nI have shared this profound truth with you, Arjuna. Those who\\nunderstand it will attain wisdom; they will have done that which has\\nto be done.\\n20\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Sixteen\\n\\nTwo Paths\\nIn this most unusual chapter, the Gita departs from a lofty view of human\\nnature and describes two opposing forces. The higher tendency, the divine,\\nleads to increasing happiness in the course of the soul’s evolution, and\\neventually to its liberation; but there is also a downward current leading to\\nsuffering and enslavement of the spirit. This chapter is unusual in giving\\nequal, if not in fact more, attention to this dark side of human nature. Here\\nwe get a detailed description of the divine qualities that liberate and the\\n“demonic” qualities that enslave (16:5).\\nIn a rare somber tone, Krishna describes the sinful person, the individual\\nof a demonic kind – and it seems he knows what he is talking about. But\\nfirst he assures Arjuna that he is of the divine type, so he shouldn’t be\\nalarmed.\\nThe “demonic” personality is basically atheistic. For such people life\\ndoes not originate in God or a divine reality but is grounded in biology, in\\nsexual desire. Taking a low view of human nature, such people cause\\nsuffering to themselves as well as others. They are arrogant and have many\\ninsatiable selfish desires, and they do not hesitate to do anything that will\\nget them what they want. Krishna grants that they may attain their desires,\\nenjoying wealth and power, but their destination is hell – a hell of their own\\nmaking, often in this very life, as their karma bears fruit.\\nOne of the least likable characteristics of “demonic” personalities is their\\nsense of self-importance. They like to give gifts ostentatiously and offer\\nritual sacrifices; this legitimizes their wealth and makes them feel\\nrespectable and esteemed. They like being generous if it will make them\\nlook good.\\nKrishna does not disguise his aversion to cruel people. He tells Arjuna\\nthat he arranges for them to be born again and again in a harsh world. Such\\nsouls cannot seem to purify their sinful hearts; repeating the same selfish\\nways, they sink lower and lower. This is a bleak picture, which the Gita\\ndwells on only in this chapter. But even here, amidst the gloom, Krishna\\nwill not say that such a soul is eternally damned. It may be that such a sinful\\ncreature is condemned to birth after birth in harsh, unfavorable\\n\\n\\x0ccircumstances, sinking into more and more hellish states of mind; but the\\ncycle goes on, the choice to change direction is always open, and the Atman\\nitself can never be stained.\\nLust, anger, and greed are the three doors to hell that Arjuna must at all\\ncosts not enter. The person who enters will not only fail to reach life’s final\\ngoal, but will not achieve any measure of lasting happiness and prosperity.\\nIn Sanskrit this chapter is called the “Way of Divine and Demonic\\nDestinies.” The words deva, god, and asura, demon, are not to be taken too\\nliterally here. The Hindu scriptures often tell stories of the battles between\\nthe gods and the demons; thus they dramatize the struggle between good\\nand evil in the world. No divine character from Hindu myth escapes a\\nchallenge from some demon. Usually the god or goddess is victorious; but\\noften the demon will win a battle or two, though not the final victory.\\nKrishna has a long battle record, celebrated by epithets like Madhusudana,\\n“slayer of the demon Madhu.” Rama, another incarnation of Vishnu, had to\\nconfront and kill Ravana. The stories go on. The gods never seem to rest for\\nlong: there is always a new challenge to their authority, a new source of\\nmalignant evil to be destroyed.\\nThe Mahabharata and the Gita do not dwell on these mythical battles.\\nHere the interest is more frankly human, and when Krishna discusses the\\n“divine” and “demonic” qualities, he speaks not of gods and demons but of\\nhuman good and evil. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c16: Two Paths\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nBe fearless and pure; never waver in your determination or your\\ndedication to the spiritual life. Give freely. Be self-controlled,\\nsincere, truthful, loving, and full of the desire to serve. Realize the\\ntruth of the scriptures; learn to be detached and to take joy in\\nrenunciation. 2 Do not get angry or harm any living creature, but be\\ncompassionate and gentle; show good will to all. 3 Cultivate vigor,\\npatience, will, purity; avoid malice and pride. Then, Arjuna, you\\nwill achieve your divine destiny.\\n1\\n\\nOther qualities, Arjuna, make a person more and more inhuman:\\nhypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty, ignorance.\\n4\\n\\nThe divine qualities lead to freedom; the demonic, to bondage. But\\ndo not grieve, Arjuna; you were born with divine attributes.\\n5\\n\\nSome people have divine tendencies, others demonic. I have\\ndescribed the divine at length, Arjuna; now listen while I describe\\nthe demonic.\\n6\\n\\nThe demonic do things they should avoid and avoid the things they\\nshould do. They have no sense of uprightness, purity, or truth.\\n7\\n\\n“There is no God,” they say, “no truth, no spiritual law, no moral\\norder. The basis of life is sex; what else can it be?” 9 Holding such\\ndistorted views, possessing scant discrimination, they become\\nenemies of the world, causing suffering and destruction.\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cHypocritical, proud, and arrogant, living in delusion and clinging\\nto deluded ideas, insatiable in their desires, they pursue their\\nunclean ends. 11 Although burdened with fears that end only with\\ndeath, they still maintain with complete assurance, “Gratification of\\nlust is the highest that life can offer.”\\n10\\n\\nBound on all sides by scheming and anxiety, driven by anger and\\ngreed, they amass by any means they can a hoard of money for the\\nsatisfaction of their cravings.\\n12\\n\\n“I got this today,” they say; “tomorrow I shall get that. This\\nwealth is mine, and that will be mine too. 14 I have destroyed my\\nenemies. I shall destroy others too! Am I not like God? I enjoy what\\nI want. I am successful. I am powerful. I am happy. 15 I am rich and\\nwell-born. Who is equal to me? I will perform sacrifices and give\\ngifts, and rejoice in my own generosity.” This is how they go on,\\ndeluded by ignorance. 16 Bound by their greed and entangled in a\\nweb of delusion, whirled about by a fragmented mind, they fall into\\na dark hell.\\n13\\n\\nSelf-important, obstinate, swept away by the pride of wealth, they\\nostentatiously perform sacrifices without any regard for their\\npurpose. 18 Egotistical, violent, arrogant, lustful, angry, envious of\\neveryone, they abuse my presence within their own bodies and in\\nthe bodies of others.\\n17\\n\\nLife after life I cast those who are malicious, hateful, cruel, and\\ndegraded into the wombs of those with similar demonic natures. 20\\nBirth after birth they find themselves with demonic tendencies.\\nDegraded in this way, Arjuna, they fail to reach me and fall lower\\nstill.\\n19\\n\\nThere are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and\\ngreed. Renounce these three. 22 Those who escape from these three\\ngates of darkness, Arjuna, seek what is best and attain life’s supreme\\ngoal. 23 Others disregard the teachings of the scriptures. Driven by\\nselfish desire, they miss the goal of life, miss even happiness and\\nsuccess.\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cTherefore let the scriptures be your guide in what to do and what\\nnot to do. Understand their teachings; then act in accordance with\\nthem.\\n24\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Seventeen\\n\\nThe Power of Faith\\nAt the end of the last chapter, Krishna told Arjuna to look to the scriptures\\nto guide his actions, so that he can avoid the lower road that leads\\nbackwards to a less evolved state. Now Arjuna wants to know about those\\nwho do not follow the orthodox way set down in the scriptures, but who\\nnevertheless offer some kind of worship with faith in their hearts.\\nIn reply Krishna goes into greater detail about the three gunas – sattva,\\nrajas, and tamas. He also stresses the importance of shraddha or faith. This\\nis a difficult word. “Faith” is not an adequate translation, and the etymology\\nof the word is obscure; it probably has an underlying meaning of “what is\\nheld in the heart.” We might say that our shraddha is the sum total of our\\nvalues, what we really hold to be important in our lives. Every human\\nbeing, Krishna says, is shraddhamaya,“made up of faith” – as the Bible\\nputs it, as we think in our heart, so we are.\\nHere, as elsewhere in the Gita, shraddha is a positive quality. It is good to\\nhave faith; yet faith can be of different kinds, different qualities. Sattvic\\nfaith is the most evolved, the most pure. Rajasic faith is dynamic, evolving,\\nyet tainted with selfish motives. Tamasic faith goes astray in a spiritual\\ndesert.\\nTo illustrate this, Krishna tells Arjuna that sattvic people worship the\\ndevas – the gods of heaven, of light. The rajasic worship yakshas and\\nrakshasas. The yakshas are servants of the god of wealth; rakshasas are\\npowerful, fearsome spirits driven by the lust for power and pleasure.\\nFinally, tamasic people worship the spirits of the dead and ghosts.\\nIn a practical digression, Krishna describes the different kinds of food\\nliked by the sattvic, the rajasic, and the tamasic. Then he applies the three\\ngunas to the act of worship and sacrifice or selfless service (yajna).\\nVerses 14–16 turn to the important question of tapas or sadhana, the\\ndisciplines undergone for the sake of spiritual growth. The Gita holds that\\nno lasting progress is possible on the spiritual path without self-discipline.\\nThe root of the word tapas is tap, to be hot or to suffer pain; and in fact\\ntapas can also mean heat or suffering. When certain spiritual practices are\\nmastered, they create a feeling of heat in the body, which is a sign of\\n\\n\\x0cincreased spiritual potency. Tapas also refers to the power gained through\\nspiritual austerity. Krishna dispels the mistaken belief that tapas means\\nmortifying or torturing the body, and points out that spiritual disciplines can\\nbe sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. The sattvic kind of tapas is offered for a truly\\nspiritual goal; rajasic tapas is performed to gain a selfish end, probably the\\nadmiration of others. Deluded by tamas, a person will undergo painful,\\nfoolish practices to try to gain power over, or even to injure, others.\\nChanging course for a moment, Krishna discusses the mantram Om Tat\\nSat. Om is the most ancient of Hindu mantrams; it is the sacred syllable that\\nis Brahman, the cosmic sound heard in the depths of meditation. Tat is\\n“That,” the supreme reality beyond what language can describe or thought\\ncan think. And sat means both “that which is” and “that which is good.”\\nThe mantram Om Tat Sat affirms that only the good really exists; the\\nopposite word, asat, implies that evil is transient and therefore is not\\nultimately real.\\nThe last verse concludes that no act or intention can add to spiritual\\ngrowth if it is “faithless.” An act done without shraddha is asat, unreal; it\\ncannot have meaning either in this world or the next. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c17: The Power of Faith\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, what is the state of those who disregard the scriptures\\nbut still worship with faith? Do they act from sattva, rajas, or tamas?\\n1\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nEvery creature is born with faith of some kind, either sattvic,\\nrajasic, or tamasic. Listen, and I will describe each to you.\\n2\\n\\nOur faith conforms to our nature, Arjuna. Human nature is made\\nof faith. A person is what his shraddha is.\\n3\\n\\nThose who are sattvic worship the forms of God; those who are\\nrajasic worship power and wealth. Those who are tamasic worship\\nspirits and ghosts. 5 Some invent harsh penances. Motivated by\\nhypocrisy and egotism, 6 they torture their innocent bodies and me\\nwho dwells within. Blinded by their strength and passion, they act\\nand think like demons.\\n4\\n\\nThe three kinds of faith express themselves in the habits of those\\nwho hold them: in the food they like, the work they do, the\\ndisciplines they practice, the gifts they give. Listen, and I will\\ndescribe their different ways.\\n7\\n\\nSattvic people enjoy food that is mild, tasty, substantial, agreeable,\\nand nourishing, food that promotes health, strength, cheerfulness,\\nand longevity. 9 Rajasic people like food that is salty or bitter, hot,\\nsour, or spicy – food that promotes pain, discomfort, and disease. 10\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cTamasic people like overcooked, stale, leftover, and impure food,\\nfood that has lost its taste and nutritional value.\\nThe sattvic perform sacrifices with their entire mind fixed on the\\npurpose of the sacrifice. Without thought of reward, they follow the\\nteachings of the scriptures. 12 The rajasic perform sacrifices for the\\nsake of show and the good it will bring them. 13 The tamasic\\nperform sacrifices ignoring both the letter and the spirit. They omit\\nthe proper prayers, the proper offerings, the proper food, and the\\nproper faith.\\n11\\n\\nTo offer service to the gods, to the good, to the wise, and to your\\nspiritual teacher; purity, honesty, continence, and nonviolence: these\\nare the disciplines of the body. 15 To offer soothing words, to speak\\ntruly, kindly, and helpfully, and to study the scriptures: these are the\\ndisciplines of speech. 16 Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint,\\nand purity: these are the disciplines of the mind.\\n14\\n\\nWhen these three levels of self-discipline are practiced without\\nattachment to the results, but in a spirit of great faith, the sages call\\nthis practice sattvic. 18 Disciplines practiced in order to gain respect,\\nhonor, or admiration are rajasic; they are undependable and\\ntransitory in their effects. 19 Disciplines practiced to gain power\\nover others, or in the confused belief that to torture oneself is\\nspiritual, are tamasic.\\n17\\n\\nGiving simply because it is right to give, without thought of\\nreturn, at a proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy\\nperson, is sattvic giving. 21 Giving with regrets or in the expectation\\nof receiving some favor or of getting something in return is rajasic.\\n22 Giving at an inappropriate time, in inappropriate circumstances,\\nand to an unworthy person, without affection or respect, is tamasic.\\n20\\n\\nOm Tat Sat: these three words represent Brahman, from which\\ncome priests and scriptures and sacrifice. 24 Those who follow the\\nVedas, therefore, always repeat the word Om when offering\\nsacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, or giving gifts. 25 Those\\nseeking liberation and not any personal benefit add the word Tat\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cwhen performing these acts of worship, discipline, and charity. 26\\nSat means “that which is”; it also indicates goodness. Therefore it is\\nused to describe a worthy deed.\\nTo be steadfast in self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving is sat.\\nTo act in accordance with these three is sat as well. 28 But to engage\\nin sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving without good faith is asat,\\nwithout worth or goodness, either in this life or in the next.\\n27\\n\\n\\x0cChapter Eighteen\\n\\nFreedom & Renunciation\\nThis final chapter of the Gita roams over many subjects, beginning with a\\ndiscussion of the merits of renunciation versus the life of personally\\ninvolved action. To begin with, Arjuna asks about two words commonly\\nused for renunciation in Sanskrit, sannyasa and tyaga. Both words come\\nfrom roots meaning to give up or abandon. Sannyasa acquired the\\nspecialized meaning of giving up ordinary life to live the austere,\\nwandering life of a homeless pilgrim. A sannyasi is a monk: one who does\\nnot participate in family life and has withdrawn from society. In a sense, he\\nhas withdrawn from life. Krishna does not recommend this kind of\\nrenunciation. In fact, he says it is impossible for anyone to “give up” in this\\nway, for as long as we have a body, we have to do a certain amount of work\\njust to maintain it. Krishna does not advise dropping out of life, and the\\nGita is primarily aimed at people who live “in the world” yet desire genuine\\nspiritual fulfillment.\\nThe kind of renunciation Krishna recommends is tyaga, where it is not\\nactivity but selfish desire for the rewards of action – of work, of life – that\\nis to be renounced. Arjuna is advised to fulfill all his responsibilities, but\\nwithout a selfish motive. In particular, he should not give up the three great\\nvirtuous works – sacrifice, giving, and spiritual disciplines.\\nHaving made plain to Arjuna that renunciation is essential, Krishna goes\\non to explain that renunciation can be of three kinds, depending upon the\\nguna that dominates the individual’s personality. As may be expected,\\nrajasic and tamasic renunciation leave something to be desired.\\nMany times Krishna has said that renunciation of the fruits of work is\\nessential. Perhaps the verse in chapter 2 said it best – that we have control\\nover our work and actions, but we have no command of the results. The\\nword karma-phala-tyaga appears again and again, and the literal translation\\nis “renunciation of the fruits of action.” In this final chapter, literally “The\\nFreedom [moksha] That Comes from Renunciation,” Krishna sums up his\\nteaching that in work, in life, one must not be driven by a selfish desire for\\nany kind of reward, for such compulsive work can only stunt full spiritual\\ndevelopment. In addition, Krishna points out, when we act out of selfish\\n\\n\\x0cattachment, we must fully partake of the result, the karma, of every thought,\\nword, and deed; and although these results may be what was desired, they\\nmay also be something not desired at all, or a little of both (18:12). In this\\nlife we can never be sure that things will turn out as planned.\\nIn verse 13 the Sankhya philosophy is again mentioned. Scholars believe\\nthat at the time the Gita was composed the Sankhya school was at an early\\nstage of development, yet even here we see the characteristic method of\\nthorough categorizing. Using the Sankhya categories of the three gunas, the\\nGita goes on to give more detail about work, which is of three kinds –\\nsattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Similarly, the doer of the work is shown to be\\ndominated by one of these all-pervasive qualities. In a very interesting\\npassage Krishna talks of three kinds of happiness – a practical application\\nof the abstract theories of Sankhya (18:36–39).\\nPursuing the world of work, and how it contributes to spiritual growth,\\nthe Gita gives a short explanation of caste in this chapter. The Gita is not\\nespecially interested in caste – the social hierarchy of Hindu society – but\\nwe do find a short explanation here. The sannyasi, the renouncing monk,\\nhas left society and therefore belongs to no caste, but Krishna does not\\npoint out that course to Arjuna. Rather, he wants Arjuna to lead an active\\nlife. Krishna tells him that devotion to his own duty is best. It is better to do\\none’s own work, even if imperfectly, than to try to take on some other work.\\nThe work proper to each of the four castes is then described. In general, the\\nGita takes a liberal view of caste, and it would be wrong to interpret this\\nchapter as supporting a rigid caste system.\\nThe final part of this chapter, verses 50 and following, give a picture of\\nthe person who has attained siddhi– success or perfection – in the spiritual\\nlife and who goes on to union with Brahman.\\nIn verse 61 Krishna returns to a favorite topic – the Lord dwelling in the\\nhearts of all beings. But here he adds a startling revelation: the Lord dwells\\nin all, yet he “whirls them around” through maya as if they were toys\\nmounted on a machine. Having jarred Arjuna with this amazing image,\\nKrishna reassures him that he can escape from the machine, the wheel of\\ntime, through devotion to God. If he wholeheartedly takes refuge in the\\nLord within, then through Krishna’s grace he will find peace.\\nAs his all but final word, Krishna reminds Arjuna that he holds him very\\ndear. Through devotion, Arjuna will be able to find his way, and he should\\nnot forget that Krishna feels deep love for him.\\n\\n\\x0cThe relationship between the teacher and student is given a parting word,\\npartially of warning. Krishna does not want these profound truths told to\\nanyone who is not ready. Anyone lacking devotion or self-control, who\\ndoes not want to hear spiritual instruction or who scoffs at it, should not be\\naccepted as a student. The sacred act of giving spiritual instruction cannot\\nbe undertaken lightly. It is the highest work, and the man or woman who\\ndoes it is most dear to Krishna.\\nFinally, Krishna asks Arjuna if he has understood. Arjuna says yes, his\\nconflicts are over; he is ready to follow Krishna’s instructions. This\\nconcludes the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna and the instruction of\\nthe Gita proper. Sanjaya, who has been narrating the poem to blind king\\nDhritarashtra, adds a few final verses of benediction. He has “seen” this\\ndialogue through his mystic vision, granted by the grace of Vyasa. Just\\nrecalling this wonderful conversation makes his hair stand on end in\\necstasy, and when he remembers Krishna’s wonderful beauty, his joy is\\nboundless. –D.M.\\n\\n\\x0c18: Freedom & Renunciation\\nARJUNA\\n\\nO Krishna, destroyer of evil, please explain to me sannyasa and\\ntyaga and how one kind of renunciation differs from another.\\n1\\n\\nKRISHNA\\n\\nTo refrain from selfish acts is one kind of renunciation, called\\nsannyasa; to renounce the fruit of action is another, called tyaga.\\n2\\n\\nAmong the wise, some say that all action should be renounced as\\nevil. Others say that certain kinds of action – self-sacrifice, giving,\\nand self-discipline – should be continued. 4 Listen, Arjuna, and I\\nwill explain three kinds of tyaga and my conclusions concerning\\nthem.\\n3\\n\\nSelf-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline should not be renounced,\\nfor they purify the thoughtful. 6 Yet even these, Arjuna, should be\\nperformed without desire for selfish rewards. This is essential.\\n5\\n\\nTo renounce one’s responsibilities is not fitting. The wise call such\\ndeluded renunciation tamasic. 8 To avoid action from fear of\\ndifficulty or physical discomfort is rajasic. There is no reward in\\nsuch renunciation. 9 But to fulfill your responsibilities knowing that\\nthey are obligatory, while at the same time desiring nothing for\\nyourself – this is sattvic renunciation. 10 Those endowed with sattva\\nclearly understand the meaning of renunciation and do not waver.\\nThey are not intimidated by unpleasant work, nor do they seek a job\\nbecause it is pleasant.\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cAs long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether.\\nTrue renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward. 12\\nThose who are attached to personal reward will reap the\\nconsequences of their actions: some pleasant, some unpleasant,\\nsome mixed. But those who renounce every desire for personal\\nreward go beyond the reach of karma.\\n11\\n\\nListen, Arjuna, and I will explain the five elements necessary for\\nthe accomplishment of every action, as taught by the wisdom of\\nSankhya. 14 The body, the means, the ego, the performance of the\\nact, and the divine will: 15 these are the five factors in all actions,\\nright or wrong, in thought, word, or deed.\\n13\\n\\nThose who do not understand this think of themselves as separate\\nagents. With their crude intellects they fail to see the truth. 17 The\\nperson who is free from ego, who has attained purity of heart,\\nthough he slays these people, he does not slay and is not bound by\\nhis action.\\n16\\n\\nKnowledge, the thing to be known, and the knower: these three\\npromote action. The means, the act itself, and the doer: these three\\nare the totality of action. 19 Knowledge, action, and the doer can be\\ndescribed according to the gunas. Listen, and I will explain their\\ndistinctions to you.\\n18\\n\\nSattvic knowledge sees the one indestructible Being in all beings,\\nthe unity underlying the multiplicity of creation. 21 Rajasic\\nknowledge sees all things and creatures as separate and distinct. 22\\nTamasic knowledge, lacking any sense of perspective, sees one\\nsmall part and mistakes it for the whole.\\n20\\n\\nWork performed to fulfill one’s obligations, without thought of\\npersonal reward or of whether the job is pleasant or unpleasant, is\\nsattvic. 24 Work prompted by selfish desire or self-will, full of\\nstress, is rajasic. 25 Work that is undertaken blindly, without any\\nconsideration of consequences, waste, injury to others, or one’s own\\ncapacities, is tamasic.\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cSattvic workers are free from egotism and selfish attachments,\\nfull of enthusiasm and fortitude in success and failure alike. 27\\nRajasic workers have strong personal desires and crave rewards for\\ntheir actions. Covetous, impure, and destructive, they are easily\\nswept away by fortune, good or bad. 28 Tamasic workers are\\nundisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, dishonest, and lazy. They\\nare easily depressed and prone to procrastination.\\n26\\n\\nListen, Arjuna, as I describe the three types of understanding and\\nwill.\\n29\\n\\nTo know when to act and when to refrain from action, what is\\nright action and what is wrong, what brings security and what\\ninsecurity, what brings freedom and what bondage: these are the\\nsigns of a sattvic intellect.\\n30\\n\\nThe rajasic intellect confuses right and wrong actions, and cannot\\ndistinguish what is to be done from what should not be done. 32 The\\ntamasic intellect is shrouded in darkness, utterly reversing right and\\nwrong wherever it turns.\\n31\\n\\nThe sattvic will, developed through meditation, keeps prana,\\nmind, and senses in vital harmony. 34 The rajasic will, conditioned\\nby selfish desire, pursues wealth, pleasure, and respectability. 35 The\\ntamasic will shows itself in obstinate ignorance, sloth, fear, grief,\\ndepression, and conceit.\\n33\\n\\nNow listen, Arjuna: there are also three kinds of happiness. By\\nsustained effort, one comes to the end of sorrow. 37 That which\\nseems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end – this is\\nthe joy of sattva, born of a mind at peace with itself. 38 Pleasure\\nfrom the senses seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter as poison in\\nthe end. This is the kind of happiness that comes to the rajasic. 39\\nThose who are tamasic draw their pleasures from sleep, indolence,\\nand intoxication. Both in the beginning and in the end, this\\nhappiness is a delusion.\\n36\\n\\n\\x0cNo creature, whether born on earth or among the gods in heaven,\\nis free from the conditioning of the three gunas. 41 The different\\nresponsibilities found in the social order – distinguishing brahmin,\\nkshatriya, vaishya, and shudra – have their roots in this\\nconditioning.\\n40\\n\\nThe responsibilities to which brahmins are born, based on their\\nnature, are self-control, tranquility, purity of heart, patience,\\nhumility, learning, austerity, wisdom, and faith.\\n42\\n\\nThe qualities of kshatriyas, based on their nature, are courage,\\nstrength, fortitude, dexterity, generosity, leadership, and the firm\\nresolve never to retreat from battle. 44 The occupations suitable for a\\nvaishya are agriculture, dairying, and trade. The proper work of a\\nshudra is service.\\n43\\n\\nBy devotion to one’s own particular duty, everyone can attain\\nperfection. Let me tell you how. 46 By performing one’s own work,\\none worships the Creator who dwells in every creature. Such\\nworship brings that person to fulfillment.\\n45\\n\\nIt is better to perform one’s own duties imperfectly than to master\\nthe duties of another. By fulfilling the obligations he is born with, a\\nperson never comes to grief. 48 No one should abandon duties\\nbecause he sees defects in them. Every action, every activity, is\\nsurrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke.\\n47\\n\\nOne who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered\\nhimself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom\\nfrom action. 50 Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who\\nhas attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme\\nconsummation of wisdom.\\n49\\n\\nUnerring in discrimination, sovereign of the senses and passions,\\nfree from the clamor of likes and dislikes, 52 such a one leads a\\nsimple, self-reliant life based on meditation, controlling speech,\\nbody, and mind.\\n51\\n\\n\\x0cFree from self-will, aggressiveness, arrogance, anger, and the lust\\nto possess people or things, they are at peace with themselves and\\nothers and enter into the unitive state. 54 United with Brahman, ever\\njoyful, beyond the reach of desire and sorrow, they have equal\\nregard for every living creature and attain supreme devotion to me.\\n55 By loving me they come to know me truly; then they know my\\nglory and enter into my boundless being. 56 All their acts are\\nperformed in my service, and through my grace they win eternal\\nlife.\\n53\\n\\nMake every act an offering to me; regard me as your only\\nprotector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always. 58\\nRemembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my\\ngrace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will\\navail you.\\n57\\n\\nIf you egotistically say, “I will not fight this battle,” your resolve\\nwill be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. 60 Your own\\nkarma, born of your own nature, will drive you to do even that\\nwhich you do not wish to do, because of your delusion.\\n59\\n\\nThe Lord dwells in the hearts of all creatures and whirls them\\nround upon the wheel of maya. 62 Run to him for refuge with all\\nyour strength, and peace profound will be yours through his grace.\\n61\\n\\nI give you these precious words of wisdom; reflect on them and\\nthen do as you choose. 64 These are the last words I shall speak to\\nyou, dear one, for your spiritual fulfillment. You are very dear to\\nme.\\n63\\n\\nBe aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to\\nme, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to\\nme. 66 Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall\\npurify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve.\\n65\\n\\nDo not share this wisdom with anyone who lacks in devotion or\\nself-control, lacks the desire to learn, or scoffs at me. 68 Those who\\nteach this supreme mystery of the Gita to all who love me perform\\n67\\n\\n\\x0cthe greatest act of love; they will come to me without doubt. 69 No\\none can render me more devoted service; no one on earth can be\\nmore dear to me.\\nThose who meditate on these holy words worship me with\\nwisdom and devotion. 71 Even those who listen to them with faith,\\nfree from doubts, will find a happier world where good people\\ndwell.\\n70\\n\\nHave you listened with attention? Are you now free from your\\ndoubts and confusion?\\n72\\n\\nARJUNA\\n\\nYou have dispelled my doubts and delusions, and I understand\\nthrough your grace. My faith is firm now, and I will do your will.\\n73\\n\\nSANJAYA\\n\\nThis is the dialogue I heard between Krishna, the son of\\nVasudeva, and Arjuna, the great-hearted son of Pritha. The wonder\\nof it makes my hair stand on end! 75 Through Vyasa’s grace, I have\\nheard the supreme secret of spiritual union directly from the Lord of\\nYoga, Krishna himself.\\n74\\n\\nWhenever I remember these wonderful, holy words between\\nKrishna and Arjuna, I am filled with joy. 77 And when I remember\\nthe breathtaking form of Krishna, I am filled with wonder and my\\njoy overflows.\\n76\\n\\nWherever the divine Krishna and the mighty Arjuna are, there\\nwill be prosperity, victory, happiness, and sound judgment. Of this I\\nam sure!\\n78\\n\\n\\x0cNotes\\nCHAPTER ONE\\n\\n1 The phrase “on the field of dharma” (dharma-kshetre) gives a hint that the\\nbattle is to be an allegorical one, a fight of dharma, justice, against\\nadharma, evil. The battle takes place not only at Kurukshetra, the\\n“field of the Kurus,” but also on the elusive “field of dharma,” the\\nspiritual realm where all moral struggles are waged.\\n40–44 These verses are particularly difficult to translate, because they\\nrevolve around the complex word dharma: law, justice, or simply\\nsomething’s inner nature. To try to capture the word in English we\\nmight say “God’s law” or “eternal truth.” Dharma is divinely given; it\\nis the force that holds things together in a unity, the center that must\\nhold if all is to go well. The opposite of dharma is adharma: evil,\\ninjustice, chaos. In these verses Arjuna gives expression to his fears of\\na coming chaos, an evil world where good people will be confused and\\nviolated. “Sense of unity” here translates dharma; the phrase “loses its\\nsense of unity” would be more literally translated as “is overcome by\\nadharma.”\\nThe translation speaks in a general way of the chaos that overcomes\\nsociety when dharma is weak – when ancient spiritual truths are\\nignored. Thus varna-samkara, literally “confusion of caste,” is more\\nmeaningful as “society [is] plunged into chaos.” The subject here is\\nnot the observance of caste restrictions, but the essential cohesion of\\nthe social fabric.\\n42 The Sanskrit refers to the ancient pinda rites that offer homage to dead\\nancestors. These rites maintained the traditions of the family by\\nrespecting and worshipping those who had gone before. Again, the\\nrather liberal rendering “the spiritual evolution begun by our\\nancestors” seems preferable to a narrower translation.\\nCHAPTER TWO\\n\\n\\x0c17 Tat, “that,” is an ancient name for Brahman, the supreme reality.\\nBrahman is neither masculine nor feminine; in fact, it has no attributes\\nat all. It is impossible to describe Brahman in words, so it is simply\\npointed to: tat.\\n72 The state of immortality is brahma-nirvana, “the nirvana that is\\nBrahman.” This is the state of release or liberation, union with the\\ndivine ground of existence. The word nirvana comes from the Sanskrit\\nroot va “to blow” with the prefix nir “out”; it means “to extinguish,” as\\na fire is said to be “blown out.” Thus it indicates the extinction of the\\nold, limited personality. By adding the word brahman, complete union\\nwith the universal Godhead is indicated. Brahma-nirvana then means\\nthe mystic state of extinction of self in the union with God. Nirvana is\\na Buddhist term as well. Some misconceptions are unfortunately\\ncurrent about this rather esoteric concept. Nirvana is wrongly\\npresented as a kind of empty nothingness, even a spiritual death. We\\nget exactly the opposite impression if we approach the Hindus and\\nBuddhists themselves. It is true there is much talk of extinguishing the\\npetty ego and going beyond self-will – the mask that hides the creative,\\nwise, loving Self underneath. This “death” of the old person to make\\nway for the new is one purpose of spiritual disciplines. It can be\\npainful, but the death of the old does not lead to annihilation but to a\\nspiritual rebirth.\\nCHAPTER THREE\\n\\n9 Here and later yajna is translated as “selfless work” or “selfless service.”\\nThe literal meaning is sacrifice: essentially, self-sacrifice, giving up\\nsomething one greatly values for the sake of a higher purpose. Some\\ntranslators give a very narrow translation of yajna as a ritualistic\\nsacrifice, but this is inaccurate.\\n39 Kama can be translated as selfish desire or pleasure, and often carries a\\nconnotation of sensual desire or sexual passion. It means essentially a\\npersonal desire for ease or pleasure, not “desire” of a more altruistic\\nkind.\\nCHAPTER FOUR\\n\\n\\x0c37 This is a well-known verse. The meanings of karma are complex, but the\\nverse is widely taken to mean that true knowledge destroys the effects\\nof past errors, which generate further karma. When consciousness is\\nunified and illumined, one is released from the bondage of karma.\\nCHAPTER FIVE\\n\\n6 Yoga has many meanings in the Gita. Here yoga is translated as “action”\\nand “selfless service” because a contrast is being made between\\nSankhya and yoga: that is, between philosophical explanation and the\\nactual practice of the spiritual life.\\n9 The word for “senses” in Sanskrit is indriya, literally “faculty” or\\n“power.” The indriyas are not only the five faculties of perception\\n(seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting) but also those of\\naction, whose organs are the hands, the feet, the tongue, and the organs\\nof excretion and reproduction.\\n13 “The city of nine gates” is the body. The gates are the two eyes, the two\\nnostrils, the two ears, the mouth, and the organs of excretion and\\nreproduction. In some lists these gates are expanded to eleven by\\nadding the navel and the brahmarandhra or sagittal suture, the opening\\nat the top of the skull.\\n27–28 The area “of spiritual consciousness” between the eyebrows is one of\\nthe seven centers of awareness or chakras described in yoga literature.\\nThese seven chakras, though not physical, are said to lie along a\\nchannel for awakened spiritual energy (kundalini) that corresponds\\nwith the spine; the chakras are located at the level of the anus, sex\\norgans, stomach, heart, throat, eyebrows, and the top of the head.\\nKundalini circulates among these centers, but it is usually confined to\\nthe lowest three chakras, corresponding to the main preoccupations of\\nlife on the physical level. In yogic concentration the vital energy\\n(kundalini) rises; samadhi is said to take place when it reaches the\\nchakras at the brow or head.\\nCHAPTER SIX\\n\\n\\x0c11 This describes the traditional seat used for meditation. The Gita is not\\nconcerned with the outer forms of the spiritual life, but here we do get\\na mention of the grass and deerskin used by the ancient sages. Perhaps\\nthe point is that they used what was available in their forest retreats,\\nand that the seat should be what Patanjali calls sukhasana: comfortable\\nenough to forget about your body.\\n14 “All actions dedicated to Brahman” is a literal translation of the Sanskrit\\nword brahmacharya, a life of self-control and sense restraint.\\nCHAPTER SEVEN\\n\\n16 Artharthi has given translators some difficulties. “Those who desire to\\nachieve their purpose” captures the basic meaning of the word. Artha\\nis goal or purpose; the second word of the compound, arthi, means\\n“one who has a goal.” So artharthi probably refers to those who take\\nto the spiritual life with a particular purpose in view. Artha also means\\nwealth or worldly goods, but to translate this phrase as “those who\\ndesire wealth” would go against the entire tenor of the Gita.\\n23 “The gods” here are the devas, the lower, celestial deities such as Indra.\\n30 These obscure terms (adhibhuta, adhidaiva, and adhiyajna) are taken up\\nin the next chapter.\\nCHAPTER EIGHT\\n\\n6 Whatever is the content of the mind at the moment of death determines\\nthe direction of the soul’s rebirth. The implication is that whatever has\\nbeen the bedrock of consciousness during life will be remembered at\\nthe time of death and lead the soul on to fulfill that desire in the next\\nlife.\\n9–10 The eyebrow center is discussed in the note to 5:27–28.\\nCHAPTER NINE\\n\\n5 Yoga here means “mysterious power.” This is yet another meaning\\nattached to the word yoga, for those who practiced yoga were\\n\\n\\x0csometimes thought of as concealing within themselves extraordinary\\npowers developed through their disciplines. The folklore of India\\nrelates many stories about mysterious yogis who have strange, divine\\npowers.\\nKrishna speaks here of his yoga aishvaram, his mysterious and\\nmajestic power. Ishvara means “lord” and aishvaram “lordly”:\\nKrishna’s yoga is something he uses as Ishvara, the Lord of the world.\\nNow he begins to show Arjuna something of the nature of the mystery.\\n17 Rig, Yajur, and Sama are the principal Vedas, the ancient scriptures that\\nare Hinduism’s orthodox authority.\\n20–21 These verses repeat the idea that heaven itself is an impermanent\\nstate. After exhausting the store of their good karma, the blessed souls\\nin heaven must be reborn on earth. Only the liberated soul, the one\\nwho has found union with Krishna or brahmanirvana, escapes the\\nround of rebirth and death as a separate, mortal creature.\\nCHAPTER TEN\\n\\nThis chapter contains many Sanskrit names, which are briefly identified\\nin the glossary (see p. 279).\\n18 Amrita, “immortal,” comes from a “not” and mrita “mortal.” The Greek\\nword ambrosia is cognate and has the same meanings: amrita is the\\nambrosia of the gods, the drink that makes them live forever, and in a\\ngeneral sense it means sweet or nectar-like. So the translation could\\nalso be “your words, which are like ambrosia.”\\n22 The mind (manas) is here taken to be one of the senses or indriyas of\\nperception; for example, it is really with the mind rather than with the\\neye that we see.\\n33 The Sanskrit alphabet, too, begins with the letter a; perhaps this is why\\nKrishna declares that among letters he is a, the first. Another possible\\nreason is that a is the most frequent sound in Sanskrit.\\nCHAPTER ELEVEN\\n\\n\\x0c14 Here Arjuna presses the palms of his hands together in the gesture called\\nanjali, like the Western gesture of prayer. This is the usual form of\\nrespectful greeting in India, as well as being used in worship and\\nprayer.\\n15 Brahma, the Creator (not to be confused with Brahman, the attributeless\\nGodhead, which is beyond the Trinity of creation, preservation, and\\ndestruction) sits within a lotus that grows from the navel of Lord\\nVishnu.\\n17 Here Arjuna sees not his friend Krishna, but the Lord incarnate in\\nKrishna: Vishnu, armed with his traditional weapons, a club (or mace)\\nand a discus. Not mentioned in this verse are the two benign symbols\\nhe carries in his other hands, a conch and a lotus.\\nCHAPTER TWELVE\\n\\n1 Arjuna is asking which path is superior, that of knowledge (jnana yoga) or\\nlove (bhakti yoga).\\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN\\n\\n5 This is a list of all the twenty-four categories given in Sankhya\\nphilosophy to describe phenomena in the field of prakriti.\\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN\\n\\n1 The ashvattha is the sacred pipal tree, a kind of fig often grown in temple\\ncompounds in India. The idea of a “world tree” appears in many\\nancient cultures. Here the Gita uses the image of the tree as “upside\\ndown,” drawing on the fact that the pipal sends out aerial roots,\\nmaking “branches above and below.” The image illustrates the\\nphenomenal world, rooted in Brahman, complete unity, and branching\\nout into the apparent diversity of life.\\n13 Rasatmaka soma is here translated as “life-giving fluid,” the\\nnourishment of plants. In Hindu mythology it is the moon, sometimes\\ncalled Soma, that nourishes plants, as the source of the life-giving\\nnectar called Soma. In the Vedas, soma is an intoxicating, invigorating\\n\\n\\x0cdrink distilled from a plant grown high in the mountains and drunk by\\nparticipants in a sacred ritual. Scholars have tried to discover what the\\nsoma plant might have been, but so far no conclusive identification has\\nbeen made. Soma also appears as an important god in the Vedas.\\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN\\n\\n27–28 Sat means that which is real or true and that which is good; it derives\\nfrom the Sanskrit verb as, to be, and is directly related to our English\\nword is. It is noteworthy that this word sat links reality and goodness,\\nreflecting the idea that good is eternal; it is merely covered from time\\nto time by asat, evil, which is temporary and in that sense unreal. Asat\\nis formed from sat by the addition of the prefix a “without,” very\\nmuch the way English forms words like amoral.\\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\\n\\n1 Sannyasa and tyaga both mean renunciation, sannyasa from the root as\\n“to cast aside” and tyaga from tyaj “to give up.” The distinction\\nbetween these two is clarified in the introduction to this chapter.\\n14 “The divine will” is a translation of daivam, which comes from the word\\ndeva, “god.” Daivam is sometimes translated as “fate,” but this is\\ninappropriate in the Gita, which is not at all fatalistic. The Gita does,\\nhowever, allow a place for God’s will or Providence in the affairs of\\nhumankind – though of course the dominant force is usually karma,\\nnot daivam.\\n34 This verse uses the phrase dharma-kama-artha, “duty, pleasure, and\\nwealth,” traditionally considered the three goals of ordinary human\\nlife. The fourth and highest goal is moksha, salvation. The rajasic\\npersonality, as this verse points out, pursues the first three worldly\\ngoals; moksha is ignored.\\n41 The Vedas establish the fourfold division of society into the classes of\\nbrahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra – roughly priests and\\nintellectuals; warriors and rulers; businessmen, farmers, and craftsmen;\\nand workers and servants.\\n\\n\\x0c66 Dharma is not used here in the usual sense of law or inner nature, but in\\na rarer meaning: a thing’s attribute, condition, or conditioning. Usually\\ndharma is used in this sense only in the plural, as here: thus dharma is\\ndivine law; dharmas are the innumerable beings, things, emotions and\\nmental states that make up everyday existence as we experience it.\\nHere, following the root meaning (dhri, to support or hold up), sarvadharman is translated as “all your supports,” in the sense of external\\nprops, conditioned dependencies. Another translation would be: “Cast\\noff your dependency on everything external, Arjuna, and rely on the\\nSelf alone.”\\n\\n\\x0cGlossary\\nThis brief glossary is a guide to Sanskrit terms used in this volume. Words\\nused once and explained in context are not included. As a rough guide,\\nSanskrit vowels may be pronounced as in Italian or Spanish. The\\ncombinations kh, gh, jh, th, dh, ph, and bh are always pronounced as the\\nconsonant plus a slight h sound: e.g., ph as in haphazard (not as in phone).\\nPronounce ch as in church; h as in home; g as in gold; j as in June except in\\nthe combination jn, which can be pronounced like gn in Italian compagna.\\nThe other consonants are approximately as in English.\\nEvery Sanskrit vowel has a short and a long form, the long pronounced\\nfor twice as long as the short. The diphthongs – e, ai, o, au – are also long.\\nThe Sanskrit alphabet has 48 characters, each representing a precisely\\ndefined sound. Scholars represent these characters in our Roman alphabet\\nby adding marks to letters as necessary, creating a system of spelling that is\\nprecise but confusing to the general reader.

And the reason is clear. It is impossible to get to the heart of\\nthose classics unless you live them, and he did live them. My admiration of\\nthe man and his works is boundless.”– Huston Smith, The World’s Religions\\nEach of these best-selling editions includes a detailed introduction\\nexplaining the historical and cultural background and core concepts of the\\nscripture, with a glossary and notes.\\nOther titles in this series:\\n\\nThe Dhammapada\\nThis collection of the Buddha’s teachings is permeated with all the power\\nand practicality of one of the world’s most appealing spiritual guides.\\nThe Upanishads\\nIn these most ancient of Indian wisdom texts, illumined sages share flashes\\nof insight, the results of many years of investigation into consciousness\\n\\n\\x0citself.\\nTHE WISDOM OF INDIA\\nEssence of the Bhagavad Gita\\nA Contemporary Guide to Yoga, Meditation, and Indian Philosophy\\nInspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Easwaran saw the Gita as “not only\\nmagnificent literature but a sure guide to human affairs – one that could\\nthrow light on the problems I faced in my own times of crisis.”\\nThis book is Easwaran’s guide to the Gita, his distillation of its teachings\\nand his answer to the questions: “What is the Gita really about? And what is\\nits relevance for us today?” Essence of the Bhagavad Gita is a completely\\nnew publication based on talks that Easwaran gave to his close students\\ntowards the end of his life, after forty years of a teaching career in which he\\ntaught, studied, and applied the principles of the Gita with a passionate,\\ncontagious enthusiasm.\\nAs an ancient scripture, the Gita can be confusing for modern readers, so\\nEaswaran highlights the main themes, explains the key concepts, and shares\\nthe verses he loves best, using his own translation from the original\\nSanskrit. Along the way, he uncovers the Gita’s startling insights into the\\nproblems threatening our civilization.\\nLike the warrior-prince Arjuna, we must learn to make wise choices. In this\\nmodern, original interpretation Easwaran shows how the Gita points a way\\nforward for us – both as individuals and in our global society today.\\nOther titles in this series:\\nEssence of the Upanishads\\nKey to Indian Spirituality\\n(Formerly titled Dialogue with Death)\\nThe Katha Upanishad, one of India’s classic wisdom texts, embraces all the\\nkey ideas of Indian spirituality within the context of a powerful mythic\\n\\n\\x0cquest. Set in the shadowy kingdom of Death, the Katha opens with the\\nyoung hero, Nachiketa, seeking answers to the age-old questions: “What is\\nthe purpose of life? And what will happen to me after I die?” The King of\\nDeath emerges as the perfect spiritual guide, challenging, uncompromising,\\nand direct.\\nBut the insights of the Katha, as with all the Upanishads, are scattered, hard\\nto understand. Easwaran explains the core concepts and presents them\\nsystematically, illustrating them through everyday examples and analogies,\\nas a way to explore deeper and deeper levels of personality. Taken this way,\\nthe Katha provides a comprehensive answer to the question “Who am I?”\\nEssence of the Dhammapada\\n(Forthcoming)\\nESSENTIAL EASWARAN LIBRARY\\nTHE BHAGAVAD GITA FOR DAILY LIVING\\nThis detailed commentary on the Bhagavad Gita in three volumes offers a\\nunique combination of wisdom, warmth, and practical spirituality.\\nEaswaran explains each verse, relates it to our modern lives through stories\\nand anecdotes, and suggests small spiritual exercises that we can use to\\nbring the Gita’s teachings into our own hearts.\\nThese volumes include the Devanagari (Sanskrit) script for each verse\\nfollowed by Easwaran’s translation, a passage from the Gita selected and\\ntranslated for passage meditation, a brief overview of Easwaran’s eightpoint program of passage meditation, a glossary, a guide to Sanskrit\\npronunciation, and a detailed index.\\nVolume 1: The End of Sorrow (Chapters 1–6 of the Bhagavad Gita)\\nVolume 2: Like a Thousand Suns (Chapters 7–12)\\nVolume 3: To Love Is to Know Me (Chapters 13–18)\\n\\n\\x0cVolume 1 concentrates on the individual: the nature of our innermost Self,\\nhow we can discover this Self in the depths of our own consciousness, and\\nhow this discovery transforms our daily living.\\nVolume 2 explores the indivisible unity governing all creation. Easwaran\\ndescribes the steps we can take to realize this unity and to heal divisions\\nwithin society and ourselves.\\nVolume 3 is global in scope, but Easwaran’s emphasis is on what we can do\\nas individuals. He explains how our everyday choices, taken all together,\\nlead our society downwards to violence, or upwards to a wiser and more\\npeaceful world.\\nPassage Meditation\\nBringing the Deep Wisdom of the Heart into Daily Life\\nIn Easwaran’s universal method of passage meditation, you choose a\\nspiritual text from the world’s great traditions that embodies your highest\\nideals. You memorize it, and then send it deep into consciousness through\\nslow, sustained attention. With regular practice, the passages become\\nlifelines, taking you to the source of wisdom deep within and then guiding\\nyou through all the challenges of daily life.\\nEknath Easwaran taught passage meditation to thousands of people for over\\nforty years, including a course at the University of California. Meditation is\\nsupported by seven other points in Easwaran’s practical spiritual program,\\nhelping you to stay calm, kind, and focused throughout the day. Thoroughly\\ntested, consistent and clear, this book gives you all you need to start\\nmeditating.\\nThe Mantram Handbook\\nA Practical Guide to Choosing Your Mantram and Calming Your Mind\\nA mantram (or mantra) is a short, powerful spiritual formula or prayer word\\nfrom the world’s great traditions. Examples include Rama, Rama, used by\\n\\n\\x0cGandhi; My God and My All, used by Saint Francis of Assisi; and the\\nBuddhist mantram, Om mani padme hum.\\nEaswaran explains how to choose a mantram, and shows through stories\\nand examples how it can be repeated silently anytime, anywhere, to help\\ncalm the mind and access our deepest wisdom.\\nRepeat your chosen mantram when you are worried, angry, or caught in\\nregrets, and the mantram will guide and comfort you like a true friend.\\nGod Makes the Rivers to Flow\\nAn Anthology of Sacred Poetry and Prose\\nThis classic anthology is Easwaran’s comprehensive collection of the\\nwisest, most life-affirming, lyrical writings from the sacred literature of the\\nworld. The passages are supported by Easwaran’s writings on spiritual\\nliving, background notes, and guidelines for using these texts for\\ninspiration, study, and for Easwaran’s own method of passage meditation.\\n\\nBIOGRAPHY\\nEknath Easwaran (1910–1999) brings to this volume a rare combination of\\ncredentials: knowledge of Sanskrit, an intuitive understanding of his Hindu\\nlegacy, and a mastery of English. He was chairman of the English\\ndepartment at a major Indian university when he came to the United States\\non a Fulbright fellowship in 1959.\\nA gifted teacher who lived for many years in the West, Easwaran explains\\nthe concepts underlying the classics of Indian spirituality in fresh,\\nauthoritative, and profoundly simple ways.\\nEaswaran’s translations of the Indian spiritual classics (The Bhagavad Gita,\\nThe Upanishads, and The Dhammapada) are the best-selling editions in\\nEnglish.

It is the dead of winter and a fierce snowstorm rages outside, but a great fire fills the space within the hall with warmth and light. Now and then, a sparrow darts in for refuge from the weather. It appears as if from nowhere, flits about joyfully in the light, and then disappears again, and where it comes from and where it goes next in that stormy darkness, we do not know. Our lives are like that, suggests an old story in Bede’s medieval history of England. We spend our days in the familiar world of our five senses, but what lies beyond that, if anything, we have no idea. Those sparrows are hints of something more outside – a vast world, perhaps, waiting to be explored. But most of us are happy to stay where we are. We may even be a bit afraid to venture into the unknown. What would be the point, we ask. Why should we leave the world we know? Yet there are always a few who are not content to spend their lives indoors. Simply knowing there is something unknown beyond their reach makes them acutely restless. They have to see what lies outside – if only, as George Mallory said of Everest, “because it’s there.” This is true of adventurers of every kind, but especially of those who seek to explore not mountains or jungles but consciousness itself: whose real drive, we might say, is not so much to know the unknown as to know the knower. Such men and women can be found in every age and every culture. While the rest of us stay put, they quietly slip out to see what lies beyond. Then, so far as we can tell, they disappear. We have no idea where they have gone; we can’t even imagine. But every now and then, like friends who have run off to some exotic land, they send back reports: breathless messages describing fantastic adventures, rambling letters about a world beyond ordinary experience, urgent telegrams begging us to come and see.  \f“Look at this view! Isn’t it breathtaking? Wish you could see this. Wish you were here.” The works in this set of translations – the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Dhammapada – are among the earliest and most universal of messages like these, sent to inform us that there is more to life than the everyday experience of our senses. The Upanishads are the oldest, so varied that we feel some unknown collectors must have tossed into a jumble all the photos, postcards, and letters from this world that they could find, without any regard for source or circumstance. Thrown together like this, they form a kind of ecstatic slide show – snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness taken at various times by different observers and dispatched with just the barest kind of explanation. But those who have traveled those heights will recognize the views: “Oh, yes, that’s Everest from the northwest – must be late spring. And here we’re south, in the full snows of winter.” The Dhammapada, too, is a collection – traditionally, sayings of the Buddha, one of the very greatest of these explorers of consciousness. In this case the messages have been sorted, but not by a scheme that makes sense to us today. Instead of being grouped by theme or topic, they are gathered according to some dominant characteristic like a symbol or metaphor – flowers, birds, a river, the sky – that makes them easy to commit to memory. If the Upanishads are like slides, the Dhammapada seems more like a field guide. This is lore picked up by someone who knows every step of the way through these strange lands. He can’t take us there, he explains, but he can show us the way: tell us what to look for, warn about missteps, advise us about detours, tell us what to avoid. Most important, he urges us that it is our destiny as human beings to make this journey ourselves. Everything else is secondary. And the third of these classics, the Bhagavad Gita, gives us a map and guidebook. It gives a systematic overview of the territory, shows various approaches to the summit with their benefits and pitfalls, offers recommendations, tells us what to pack and what to leave behind. More than either of the others, it gives the sense of a personal guide. It asks and answers the questions that you or I might ask – questions not about philosophy or mysticism, but about how to live effectively in a world of challenge and change. Of these three, it is the Gita that has been my own personal guidebook, just as it was Mahatma Gandhi’s.  \fThese three texts are very personal records of a landscape that is both real and universal. Their voices, passionately human, speak directly to you and me. They describe the topography of consciousness itself, which belongs as much to us today as to these largely anonymous seers thousands of years ago. If the landscape seems dark in the light of sense perception, they tell us, it has an illumination of its own, and once our eyes adjust we can see in what Western mystics call this “divine dark” and verify their descriptions for ourselves. And this world, they insist, is where we belong. This wider field of consciousness is our native land. We are not cabin-dwellers, born to a life cramped and confined; we are meant to explore, to seek, to push the limits of our potential as human beings. The world of the senses is just a base camp: we are meant to be as much at home in consciousness as in the world of physical reality. This is a message that thrills men and women in every age and culture. It is for such kindred spirits that these texts were originally composed, and it is for them in our own time that I undertook these translations, in the conviction that they deserve an audience today as much as ever. If these books speak to even a handful of such readers, they will have served their purpose.  \fIntroduction  The Bhagavad Gita Many years ago, when I was still a graduate student, I traveled by train from central India to Simla, then the summer seat of the British government in India. We had not been long out of Delhi when suddenly a chattering of voices disturbed my reverie. I asked the man next to me if something had happened. “Kurukshetra!” he replied. “The next stop is Kurukshetra!” I could understand the excitement. Kurukshetra, “the field of the Kurus,” is the setting for the climactic battle of the Mahabharata, the vastest epic in any world literature, on which virtually every Hindu child in India is raised. Its characters, removed in time by some three thousand years, are as familiar to us as our relatives. The temper of the story is utterly contemporary; I can imagine it unfolding in the nuclear age as easily as in the dawn of Indian history. The Mahabharata is literature at its greatest – in fact, it has been called a literature in itself, comparable in its breadth and depth and characterization to the whole of Greek literature or Shakespeare. But what makes it unique is that embedded in this literary masterpiece is one of the finest mystical documents the world has seen: the Bhagavad Gita. I must have heard the Gita recited thousands of times when I was growing up, but I don’t suppose it had any special significance for me then. Not until I went to college and met Mahatma Gandhi did I begin to understand why nothing in the long, rich stretch of Indian culture has had a wider appeal, not only within India but outside as well. Today, after more than thirty years of devoted study, I would not hesitate to call it India’s most important gift to the world. The Gita has been translated into every major language and perhaps a hundred times into English alone; commentaries on it are said to be more numerous than on any other scripture. Like the Sermon on the Mount, it has an immediacy that sweeps away time, place, and circumstance. Addressed to everyone, of whatever background or status, the Gita distills the loftiest truths of India’s ancient wisdom into simple, memorable poetry that haunts the mind and informs the affairs of everyday life.  \fEveryone in our car got down from the train to wander for a few minutes on the now peaceful field. Thousands of years ago this was Armageddon. The air rang with the conch-horns and shouts of battle for eighteen days. Great phalanxes shaped like eagles and fish and the crescent moon surged back and forth in search of victory, until in the end almost every warrior in the land lay slain. “Imagine!” my companion said to me in awe. “Bhishma and Drona commanded their armies here. Arjuna rode here, with Sri Krishna himself as his charioteer. Where you’re standing now – who knows? – Arjuna might have sat, his bow and arrows on the ground, while Krishna gave him the words of the Bhagavad Gita.” The thought was thrilling. I felt the way Schliemann must have when he finally reached that desolate bluff of western Turkey and knew he was standing “on the ringing plains of windy Troy,” walking the same ground as Achilles, Odysseus, Hector, and Helen. Yet at the same time, I felt I knew the setting of the Gita much more intimately than I could ever know this peaceful field. The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gita’s subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious. THE GITA AND ITS SETTING  Historians surmise that like the Iliad, the Mahabharata might well be based on actual events, culminating in a war that took place somewhere around 1000 B.C. – close, that is, to the very dawn of recorded Indian history. This guess has recently been supported by excavations at the ancient city of Dvaraka, which, according to the Mahabharata, was destroyed and submerged in the sea after the departure of its divine ruler, Krishna. Only five hundred years or so before this, by generally accepted guess, Aryan tribes originally from the area between the Caspian Sea and the Hindu Kush mountains had migrated into the Indian subcontinent, bringing the prototype of the Sanskrit language and countless elements of belief and culture that have been part of the Hindu tradition ever since. The oldest part of the most ancient of Hindu scriptures, the Rig Veda, dates from this period – about 1500 B.C., if not earlier. Yet the wellspring of Indian religious faith, I believe, can be traced to a much earlier epoch. When the Aryans entered the Indian subcontinent through the mountains of the Hindu Kush, they encountered a civilization  \fon the banks of the Indus river that archeologists date back as far as 3000 B.C. Roughly contemporaneous with the pyramid-builders on the Nile, these Indus-dwellers achieved a comparable level of technology. They had metalworkers skilled in sheet-making, riveting, and casting of copper and bronze, crafts and industries with standardized methods of production, land and sea trade with cultures as far away as Mesopotamia, and well-planned cities with water supply and public sanitation systems unequaled until the Romans. Evidence suggests that they may have used a decimal system of measurement. But most remarkable, images of Shiva as Yogeshvara, the Lord of Yoga, suggest that meditation was practiced in a civilization which flourished a millennium before the Vedas were committed to an oral tradition. If this is so, it would imply that the same systematic attitude the Indus Valley dwellers applied to their technology was applied also to study of the mind. This was brahmavidya, the “supreme science” – supreme because where other sciences studied the external world, brahmavidya sought knowledge of an underlying reality which would inform all other studies and activities. Whatever its origins, in the early part of the first millennium B.C. we find clearly stated both the methods and the discoveries of brahmavidya. With this introspective tool the inspired rishis (literally “seers”) of ancient India analyzed their awareness of human experience to see if there was anything in it that was absolute. Their findings can be summarized in three statements which Aldous Huxley, following Leibnitz, has called the Perennial Philosophy because they appear in every age and civilization: (1) there is an infinite, changeless reality beneath the world of change; (2) this same reality lies at the core of every human personality; (3) the purpose of life is to discover this reality experientially: that is, to realize God while here on earth. These principles and the interior experiments for realizing them were taught systematically in “forest academies” or ashrams – a tradition which continues unbroken after some three thousand years. The discoveries of brahmavidya were systematically committed to memory (and eventually to writing) in the Upanishads, visionary documents that are the earliest and purest statement of the Perennial Philosophy. How many of these precious records once existed no one knows; a dozen that date from Vedic times have survived as part of the Hindu canon of authority, the four Vedas. All have one unmistakable hallmark: the vivid  \fstamp of personal mystical experience. These are records of direct encounter with the divine. Tradition calls them shruti: literally “heard,” as opposed to learned; they are their own authority. By convention, only the Vedas (including their Upanishads) are considered shruti, based on direct knowledge of God. According to this definition, all other Indian scriptures – including the Gita – are secondary, dependent on the higher authority of the Vedas. However, this is a conventional distinction and one that might disguise the nature of the documents it classifies. In the literal sense the Gita too is shruti, owing its authority not to other scriptures but to the fact that it set down the direct mystical experience of a single author. Shankara, a towering mystic of the ninth century A.D. whose word carries the authority of Augustine, Eckhart, and Aquinas all in one, must have felt this, for in selecting the minimum sources of Hinduism he passed over almost a hundred Upanishads of Vedic authority to choose ten central Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. The Gita, I would argue, is not an integral part of the Mahabharata. It is essentially an Upanishad, and my conjecture is that it was set down by an inspired seer (traditionally Vyasa) and inserted into the epic at the appropriate place. Other elements were added in this way to the Mahabharata, and to other popular secondary scriptures; it is an effective way of preserving new material in an oral tradition. There is also traditional weight behind this idea, for as far back as anyone can trace, each chapter of the Gita has ended with the same formula: “In the Bhagavad-Gita Upanishad, the text on the supreme science [brahmavidya] of yoga, this is the chapter entitled . . .” Finally, by way of further support, we can observe that except for its first chapter, which sets the stage, the Gita not only does not develop the action of the Mahabharata but is rather at odds with it. Battle lines are drawn – the climax of decades of dissension – and on the eve of combat, Prince Arjuna loses his nerve and asks his charioteer, Krishna, what to do. Then what? Krishna – no ordinary charioteer, but an incarnation of God – enters into some seven hundred verses of sublime instruction on the nature of the soul and its relation to God, the levels of consciousness and reality, the makeup of the phenomenal world, and so on, culminating in a stupendous mystical experience in which he reveals himself to Arjuna as the transcendent Lord of life and death. He counsels Arjuna to be compassionate to friend and  \fenemy alike, to see himself in every person, to suffer others’ sorrows as his own. Then the Gita is over, the narration picks up again, and battle is joined – a terrible, desperate slaughter compromising everyone’s honor, by the end of which Arjuna’s side emerges victorious. But almost every man of fighting age on both sides has been slain. Only great genius would have placed the Gita in such a dramatic setting, but it stands out from the rest as a timeless, practical manual for daily living. To those who take this dramatic setting as part of the spiritual instruction and get entangled in the question of the Gita justifying war, Gandhi had a practical answer: just base your life on the Gita sincerely and systematically and see if you find killing or even hurting others compatible with its teachings. (He makes the same point of the Sermon on the Mount.) The very heart of the Gita’s message is to see the Lord in every creature and act accordingly, and the scripture is full of verses to spell out what this means: I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me. They worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. (6:30–31) When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. (6:32) That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. (12:13) They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. (13:27–28) Scholars can debate the point forever, but when the Gita is practiced, I think, it becomes clear that the struggle the Gita is concerned with is the struggle for self-mastery. It was Vyasa’s genius to take the whole great Mahabharata epic and see it as metaphor for the perennial war between the forces of light and the forces of darkness in every human heart. Arjuna and Krishna are then no longer merely characters in a literary masterpiece. Arjuna becomes Everyman, asking the Lord himself, Sri Krishna, the  \fperennial questions about life and death – not as a philosopher, but as the quintessential man of action. Thus read, the Gita is not an external dialogue but an internal one: between the ordinary human personality, full of questions about the meaning of life, and our deepest Self, which is divine. There is, in fact, no other way to read the Gita and grasp it as spiritual instruction. If I could offer only one key to understanding this divine dialogue, it would be to remember that it takes place in the depths of consciousness and that Krishna is not some external being, human or superhuman, but the spark of divinity that lies at the core of the human personality. This is not literary or philosophical conjecture; Krishna says as much to Arjuna over and over: “I am the Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence” (10:20). In such statements the Gita distills the essence of the Upanishads, not piecemeal but comprehensively, offering their lofty insights as a manual not of philosophy but of everyday human activity – a handbook of the Perennial Philosophy unique in world history. THE UPANISHADIC BACKGROUND  The Gita, naturally enough, takes for granted that its audience is familiar with the basic ideas of Hindu religious thought, almost all of which can be found in the Upanishads. It also uses some technical vocabulary from yoga psychology. All this needs to be explained in contemporary terms if the modern reader is to grasp what is essential and timeless in the Gita’s message and not get bogged down in strange terminology. First, however, the non-Hindu faces a third obstacle: the multiplicity of names used for aspects of God. From the earliest times, Hinduism has proclaimed one God while accommodating worship of him (or her, for to millions God is the Divine Mother) in many different names. “Truth is one,” says a famous verse of the Rig Veda; “people call it by various names.” Monastic devotees might find that Shiva embodies the austere detachment they seek; devotees who want to live “in the world,” partaking of its innocent pleasures but devoted to service of their fellow creatures, might find in Krishna the perfect incarnation of their ideals. In every case, this clothing of the Infinite in human form serves to focus a devotee’s love and to provide an inspiring ideal. But whatever form is worshipped, it is only an aspect of the same one God.  \fIn the Gita – in fact, virtually everywhere in Hindu myth and scripture – we also encounter “the gods” in the plural. These are the devas, deities which seem to have come in with the Aryans and which have recognizable counterparts in other Aryan-influenced cultures: Indra, god of war and storm; Varuna, god of waters and a moral overseer; Agni, god of fire, the Hermes-like intermediary between heaven and earth; and so on. The Gita refers to the devas as being worshipped by those who want to propitiate natural and supernatural powers, in much the same way that ancestors were worshipped. In modern terms, they can best be understood as personifying the forces of nature. This question out of the way, we can proceed to the Upanishadic background the Gita assumes. Atman and Brahman  The Upanishads are not systematic philosophy; they are more like ecstatic slide shows of mystical experience – vivid, disjointed, stamped with the power of direct personal encounter with the divine. If they seem to embrace contradictions, that is because they do not try to smooth over the seams of these experiences. They simply set down what the rishis saw, viewing the ultimate reality from different levels of spiritual awareness, like snapshots of the same object from different angles: now seeing God as utterly transcendent, for example, now seeing God as immanent as well. These differences are not important, and the Upanishads agree on their central ideas: Brahman, the Godhead; Atman, the divine core of personality; dharma, the law that expresses and maintains the unity of creation; karma, the web of cause and effect; samsara, the cycle of birth and death; moksha, the spiritual liberation that is life’s supreme goal. Even while ancient India was making breakthroughs in the natural sciences and mathematics, the sages of the Upanishads were turning inward to analyze the data that nature presents to the mind. Penetrating below the senses, they found not a world of solid, separate objects but a ceaseless process of change – matter coming together, dissolving, and coming together again in a different form. Below this flux of things with “name and form,” however, they found something changeless: an infinite, indivisible reality in which the transient data of the world cohere. They called this reality Brahman: the Godhead, the divine ground of existence.  \fThis analysis of the phenomenal world tallies well enough with contemporary physics. A physicist would remind us that the things we see “out there” are not ultimately separate from each other and from us; we perceive them as separate because of the limitations of our senses. If our eyes were sensitive to a much finer spectrum, we might see the world as a continuous field of matter and energy. Nothing in this picture resembles a solid object in our usual sense of the word. “The external world of physics,” wrote Sir Arthur Eddington, “has thus become a world of shadows. In removing our illusions we remove the substance, for indeed we have seen that substance is one of the greatest of our illusions.” Like the physicists, these ancient sages were seeking an invariant. They found it in Brahman. In examining our knowledge of ourselves, the sages made a similar discovery. Instead of a single coherent personality, they found layer on layer of components – senses, emotions, will, intellect, ego – each in flux. At different times and in different company, the same person seems to have different personalities. Moods shift and flicker, even in those who are emotionally stable; desires and opinions change with time. Change is the nature of the mind. The sages observed this flow of thoughts and sensations and asked, “Then where am I?” The parts do not add up to a whole; they just flow by. Like physical phenomena, the mind is a field of forces, no more the seat of intelligence than radiation or gravity is. Just as the world dissolves into a sea of energy, the mind dissolves into a river of impressions and thoughts, a flow of fragmentary data that do not hold together. Western philosophers have reasoned their way to a similar conclusion, but with them it was an intellectual exercise. David Hume confesses that whenever he was forced to conclude that his empirical ego was insubstantial, he went out for a walk, had a good dinner, and forgot all about it. For these ancient sages, however, these were not logical conclusions but personal discoveries. They were actually exploring the mind, testing each level of awareness by withdrawing consciousness to the level below. In profound meditation, they found, when consciousness is so acutely focused that it is utterly withdrawn from the body and mind, it enters a kind of singularity in which the sense of a separate ego disappears. In this state, the supreme climax of meditation, the seers discovered a core of consciousness beyond time and change. They called it simply Atman, the Self. I have described the discovery of Atman and Brahman – God immanent and God transcendent – as separate, but there is no real distinction. In the  \fclimax of meditation, the sages discovered unity: the same indivisible reality without and within. It was advaita, “not two.” The Chandogya Upanishad says epigrammatically, Tat tvam asi: “Thou art That.” Atman is Brahman: the Self in each person is not different from the Godhead. Nor is it different from person to person. The Self is one, the same in every creature. This is not some peculiar tenet of the Hindu scriptures; it is the testimony of everyone who has undergone these experiments in the depths of consciousness and followed them through to the end. Here is Ruysbroeck, a great mystic of medieval Europe; every word is most carefully chosen: The image of God is found essentially and personally in all mankind. Each possesses it whole, entire and undivided, and all together not more than one alone. In this way we are all one, intimately united in our eternal image, which is the image of God and the source in us of all our life. Maya  In the unitive experience, every trace of separateness disappears; life is a seamless whole. But the body cannot remain in this state for long. After a while, awareness of mind and body returns, and then the conventional world of multiplicity rushes in again with such vigor and vividness that the memory of unity, though stamped with reality, seems as distant as a dream. The unitive state has to be entered over and over until a person is established in it. But once established, even in the midst of ordinary life, one sees the One underlying the many, the Eternal beneath the ephemeral. What is it that makes undivided reality appear to be a world of separate, transient objects? What makes each of us believe that we are the body rather than our own Self? The sages answered with a story still told after thousands of years. Imagine, they said, a man dreaming that he is being attacked by a tiger. His pulse will race, his fists will clench, his forehead will be wet with the dew of fear – all just as if the attack were real. He will be able to describe the look of his tiger, the way he smelled, the sound of his roar. For him the tiger is real, and in a sense he is not wrong: the evidence he has is not qualitatively different from the kind of evidence we trust when we are awake. People have even died from the physiological effects of a potent dream. Only when we wake up can we realize that our  \fdream-sensations, though real to our nervous system, are a lower level of reality than the waking state. The Upanishads delineate three ordinary states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep. Each is real, but each has a higher order of reality. For beyond these three, the Upanishads say, is the unitive state, called simply “the fourth”: turiya. Entering this state is similar to waking up out of dream sleep: the individual passes from a lower level of reality to a higher one. The sages called the dream of waking life – the dream of separate, merely physical existence – by a suggestive name, maya. In general use the word meant a kind of magic, the power of a god or sorcerer to make a thing appear to be something else. In the Gita, maya becomes the creative power of the Godhead, the primal creative energy that makes unity appear as the world of innumerable separate things with “name and form.” Later philosophers explained maya in surprisingly contemporary terms. The mind, they said, observes the so-called outside world and sees its own structure. It reports that the world consists of a multiplicity of separate objects in a framework of time, space, and causality because these are the conditions of perception. In a word, the mind looks at unity and sees diversity; it looks at what is timeless and reports transience. And in fact the percepts of its experience are diverse and transient; on this level of experience, separateness is real. Our mistake is in taking this for ultimate reality, like the dreamer thinking that nothing is real except his dream. Nowhere has this “mysterious Eastern notion” been formulated more succinctly than in the epigram of Ruysbroeck: “We behold what we are, and we are what we behold.” When we look at unity through the instruments of the mind, we see diversity; when the mind is transcended, we enter a higher mode of knowing – turiya, the fourth state of consciousness – in which duality disappears. This does not mean, however, that the phenomenal world is an illusion or unreal. The illusion is the sense of separateness. Here again we can illustrate from physics: the world of “name and form” exists only as a condition of perception; at the subatomic level, separate phenomena dissolve into a flux of energy. The effect of maya is similar. The world of the senses is real, but it must be known for what it is: unity appearing as multiplicity. Those who disidentify themselves with the conditions of perception in maya wake up into a higher mode of knowing in which the unity of life is  \fapprehended directly. The disciplines for achieving this are called yoga, as is the state of union: the word comes from the root yuj, to yoke or bind together. The “experience” itself (properly speaking, it is beyond experience) is called samadhi. And the state attained is moksha or nirvana, both of which signify going beyond the conditioning of maya – time, space, and causality. In this state we realize that we are not a physical creature but the Atman, the Self, and thus not separate from God. We see the world not as pieces but whole, and we see that whole as a manifestation of God. Once identified with the Self, we know that although the body will die, we will not die; our awareness of this identity is not ruptured by the death of the physical body. Thus we have realized the essential immortality which is the birthright of every human being. To such a person, the Gita says, death is no more traumatic than taking off an old coat (2:22). Life cannot offer any higher realization. The supreme goal of human existence has been attained. The man or woman who realizes God has everything and lacks nothing: having this, “they desire nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow” (6:22). Life cannot threaten such a person; all it holds is the opportunity to love, to serve, and to give. Dharma, Karma, Rebirth, and Liberation  It has been said that if you understand just two words, dharma and karma, you will have grasped the essence of Hinduism. This is a simplification, but it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of these concepts. Both are deeply embedded in Hindu thought, and the Gita, like other Hindu scriptures, takes them for granted, not as theoretical premises but as facts of life that can be verified in personal experience. The word dharma means many things, but its underlying sense is “that which supports,” from the root dhri, to support, hold up, or bear. Generally, dharma implies support from within: the essence of a thing, its virtue, that which makes it what it is. An old story illumines this meaning with the highest ideal of Hinduism. A sage, seated beside the Ganges, notices a scorpion that has fallen into the water. He reaches down and rescues it, only to be stung. Some time later he looks down and sees the scorpion thrashing about in the water again. Once more he reaches down to rescue it, and once more he is stung. A bystander,  \fobserving all this, exclaims, “Holy one, why do you keep doing that? Don’t you see that the wretched creature will only sting you in return?” “Of course,” the sage replied. “It is the dharma of a scorpion to sting. But it is the dharma of a human being to save.” On a larger scale, dharma means the essential order of things, an integrity and harmony in the universe and the affairs of life that cannot be disturbed without courting chaos. Thus it means rightness, justice, goodness, purpose rather than chance. Underlying this idea is the oneness of life: the Upanishadic discovery that all things are interconnected because at its deepest level creation is indivisible. This oneness bestows a basic balance on the whole of nature such that any disturbance in one place has to send ripples everywhere, as a perfect bubble, touched lightly in one place, trembles all over until balance is restored. The implications are caught perfectly by those famous lines from John Donne, which deserve to be read now with a fresh eye as not merely great rhetoric but a faithful representation of reality: No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee. There is an ancient Sanskrit epigram, Ahimsa paramo dharma: the highest dharma is ahimsa, nonviolence, universal love for all living creatures; for every kind of violence is a violation of dharma, the fundamental law of the unity of life. Thus every act or thought has consequences, which themselves will have consequences; life is the most intricate web of interconnections. This is the law of karma, one of the most important and least understood ideas in ancient Indian thought. Karma is repeated so often in the Gita that I want to illustrate it in some detail: some intuitive sense of karma as an organic law makes Krishna’s teachings a good deal clearer. Literally, the Sanskrit karma means something that is done. Often it can be translated as deed or action. The law of karma states simply that every event is both a cause and an effect. Every act has consequences of a similar  \fkind, which in turn have further consequences and so on; and every act, every karma, is also the consequence of some previous karma. This refers not only to physical action but to mental activity as well. In their analysis of the phenomenal world and the world within, the sages of the Upanishads found that there is not merely an accidental but an essential relationship between mental and physical activity. Given appropriate conditions to develop further, thoughts breed actions of the same kind, as a seed can grow only into one particular kind of tree. Baldly put, the law of karma says that whatever you do will come back to you. No one, of course, has the omniscience to see the picture fully. But the idea of a network of connections, far from being occult, is natural and plausible. The law of karma states unequivocally that though we cannot see the connections, we can be sure that everything that happens to us, good and bad, originated once in something we did or thought. We ourselves are responsible for what happens to us, whether or not we can understand how. It follows that we can change what happens to us by changing ourselves; we can take our destiny into our own hands. The physical side of karma, however, only touches the surface of life. To get an inkling of how karma really works, we have to consider the mind. Everything we do produces karma in the mind. In fact, it is in the mind rather than the world that karma’s seeds are planted. Aptly, Indian philosophy compares a thought to a seed: very tiny, but it can grow into a huge, deep-rooted, wide-spreading tree. I have seen places where a seed in a crack of a pavement grew into a tree that tore up the sidewalk. It is difficult to remove such a tree, and terribly difficult to undo the effects of a lifetime of negative thinking, which can extend into many other people’s lives. But it can be done, and the purpose of the Gita is to show how. Karma is sometimes considered punitive, a matter of getting one’s just desserts. This is accurate enough, but it is much more illuminating to consider karma an educative force whose purpose is to teach the individual to act in harmony with dharma – not to pursue selfish interests at the expense of others, but to contribute to life and consider the welfare of the whole. In this sense life is like a school; one can learn, one can graduate, one can skip a grade or stay behind. As long as a debt of karma remains, however, a person has to keep coming back for further education. That is the basis of samsara, the cycle of birth and death.  \fA good many wrong and misleading words have been written on this subject, largely because of the fascination it seems to hold in the West. Rightly understood, however, reincarnation is not exotic but quite natural. If personality consists of several sheaths, the body being only the outermost, there is no reason why personality should die when the body is shed. The sages of the Upanishads saw personality as a field of forces. Packets of karma to them are forces that have to work themselves out; if the process is interrupted by death, those forces remain until conditions allow them to work again in a new context. Again, sleep can illustrate the dynamics of this idea. In sleep a person passes in and out of two stages, dreaming and dreamless sleep. In the first, consciousness is withdrawn from the body and senses but still engaged in the mind. In dreamless sleep, however, consciousness is withdrawn from the mind as well. Then the thinking process – even the sense of “I” – is temporarily suspended, and consciousness is said to rest in the Self. In this state a person ceases to be a separate creature, a separate personality. In dreamless sleep, the Upanishads say, a king is not a king nor a pauper poor; no one is old or young, male or female, educated or ignorant. When consciousness returns to the mind, however, the thinking process starts up again, and personality returns to the body. According to this analysis, the ego dies every night. Every morning we pick up our desires where we left off: the same person, yet a little different too. The Upanishads describe dying as a very similar process. Consciousness is withdrawn from the body into the senses, from the senses into the mind, and finally consolidated in the ego; when the body is finally wrenched away, the ego remains, a potent package of desires and karma. And as our last waking thoughts shape our dreams, the contents of the unconscious at the time of death – the residue of all that we have thought and desired and lived for in the past – determine the context of our next life. We take a body again, the sages say, to come back to just the conditions where our desires and karma can be fulfilled. The Self-realized person, however, has no karma to work out, no personal desires; at the time of death he or she is absorbed into the Lord: But they for whom I am the supreme goal, who do all work renouncing self for me and meditate on me with single-hearted devotion, these I  \fwill swiftly rescue from the fragment’s cycle of birth and death, for their consciousness has entered into me. (12:6–7) Such a person, the Upanishads stress, can actually shed the body voluntarily when the hour of death arrives, by withdrawing consciousness step by step in full awareness. Some of the Gita’s most fascinating verses, for those who can interpret them, are Krishna’s instructions on how to die (8:12–13). YOGA PSYCHOLOGY  In trying to describe their discoveries, the Upanishadic seers developed a specialized vocabulary. Their terms were later elaborated by mystics who were also brilliant philosophers – Kapila, Shankara, and others, the ancient Indian counterparts of authorities like Augustine and Aquinas in the West. The most useful part of this vocabulary comes from Sankhya, the philosophical system whose practical counterpart is the school of meditation called Yoga. Both are traditionally traced to one towering authority, Kapila, and have much in common with Buddhist philosophy. An ancient saying celebrates their practicality: “There is no theory like Sankhya, no practice like Yoga.” The Gita does not belong to the Sankhya school or to any other; it is as comprehensive as the Upanishads. But Sankhya provides a precise vocabulary for describing the workings of the mind, and the Gita draws on that vocabulary freely. Sankhya philosophy posits two separate categories: Purusha, spirit, and prakriti, everything else. This is not the Western mind-matter distinction. Prakriti is the field of what can be known objectively, the field of phenomena, the world of whatever has “name and form”: that is, not only of matter and energy but also of the mind. As physics postulates a unified field from which all phenomena can be derived, Sankhya describes a field that includes mental phenomena as well. Mind, energy, and matter all belong to a field of forces. Purusha, pure spirit, is the knower of this field of phenomena, and belongs to a wholly different order of reality. Only Purusha is conscious – or, rather, Purusha is consciousness itself. What we call “mind” is only an internal instrument that Purusha uses, just as the body is its external instrument. For practical purposes – at least as far as the Gita is  \fconcerned – Purusha may be regarded as a synonym for Atman. Purusha is the Self, beyond all change, the same in every creature. Matter and Mind  Perhaps I should confess at this point that the paragraphs that follow in this short section are somewhat technical and not necessary for understanding the Gita. They can be skipped by anyone who finds them dry. I include them simply because Sankhya’s explanation of mind and matter, when properly understood, makes sense of many subjects in the Gita that might otherwise seem arbitrary: maya, the survival of personality after death, the way karma works through the mind. It accommodates modern physics perfectly and offers promising explanations of mind-body relationships in health and disease. However, Sankhya’s way of looking at the mind is very different from our usual physical orientation, and therefore impossible to absorb without reflection. Sankhya’s hallmark is a list (sankhya means counting or listing) of twenty-four principles or tattvas (“suchnesses”) which trace the steps by which unitary, primordial prakriti becomes manifested as the countless forms of mind, matter, and energy that make up the world we live in. The tattvas are listed in the Gita: The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy [prakriti] from which all these evolved. (13:5) I know of no English words to use for most of these twenty-four constituents. Manas corresponds roughly to mind the way that word is commonly used; buddhi is the discriminative faculty, the discriminating intellect; ahamkara, literally “I-maker,” is the sense of ego. I have used such rough labels in the translation which follows, but really they are technical terms with precise definitions, each associated with a specific function and level of consciousness. Approximations are misleading because they bring in associations from Western philosophy, which has a wholly different orientation. Behind all these categories lies a powerful, practical assumption: Sankhya is not trying to describe physical reality; it is  \fanalyzing consciousness, knowledge, for the sole purpose of unraveling the human being’s true identity. So it does not begin with the material universe as something different and separate from the mind that perceives it. It does not talk about sense objects outside us and senses within and then try to get the two together. It begins with one world of experience. Sense objects and senses are not separate; they are two aspects of the same event. Mind, energy, and matter are a continuum, and the universe is not described as it might be in itself, but as it presents itself to the human mind. As they say in the “new physics,” it is not just an observable universe but a participatory universe. Let me illustrate. This morning I had a fresh mango for breakfast: a large, beautiful, fragrant one which had been allowed to ripen until just the right moment, when the skin was luminous with reds and oranges. You can see from that kind of description that I like mangoes. I must have eaten thousands of them when I was growing up, and I probably know most varieties intimately by their color, shape, flavor, fragrance, and feel. Sankhya would say that this mango I appreciated so much does not exist in the world outside – at least, not with the qualities I ascribed to it. The mango-in-itself, for example, is not red and orange; these are categories of a nervous system that can deal only with a narrow range of radiant energy. My dog Bogart would not see a luscious red and orange mango. He would see some gray mass with no distinguishing features, much less interesting to him than a piece of buttered toast. But my mind takes in messages from five senses and fits them into a precise mango-form in consciousness, and that form – nothing outside – is what I experience. Not that there is no “real” mango! But what I experience, the objects of my sense perception and my “knowing,” are in consciousness, nowhere else. A brilliant neuroscientist I was reading recently says something similar in contemporary language: we never really encounter the world; all we experience is our own nervous system. When the Gita says that the material world is made up of five “material elements,” then, it is talking about the world as we perceive it through our five senses. The objects of this world are in the mind, not outside. “Physical objects” in this sense require a mental component also: five “essences” or mental conditions of perception, each corresponding to one of the five senses. From these five tanmatras derive on the one hand the five sense organs, and on the other hand the five material elements. You can see that  \fthe number five and the correspondences of Sankhya are not arbitrary, but reflect the ways we have of sorting electrical information supplied to the brain. Four of these elements have names similar to those from ancient philosophy in the West – earth, air, fire, and water. But if we remember that we are talking about principles of perception rather than “earth-stuff,” “firestuff,” and so on, it should become clear that this is not an antiquated theory left behind by the progress of physical science. It is quite sophisticated and accommodates contemporary physical thought rather well, for it recognizes that in the act of knowing, the mind conditions what is known. Senses and sense objects, then, are very intimately related. There is a causal connection, for example, between the things we see and the physical organ of seeing, the eye and its related branches of the nervous system: both depend on the underlying form in the mind that conditions how we perceive light. The objects we see are shaped by the way we see. So senses and sense objects “make sense” only together: each is incomplete without the other. That is why there is such a strong pull between senses and sense objects. On the other hand, the Gita says, this pull has nothing to do with us – the Self, the knower. When Krishna keeps telling Arjuna to train his mind to be alike in pleasure and pain, he is simply being practical: to discover unity, consciousness has to be withdrawn from the hold of the senses, which ties it to duality. When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. Those who are not affected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. (2:14–15) The sensory attraction of pleasure is just an interaction between inert elements of similar stuff, very much like a magnetic pull between two objects. We are not involved. When I look at a fresh, ripe mango, it is natural for my senses to respond; that is their nature. But I should be able to stand aside and watch this interaction with detachment, the way people stand and watch while movers unload a van. In that way I can enjoy what my senses report without ever having to act compulsively on their likes and dislikes.  \fSankhya’s explanation of mind and body has profound implications for psychosomatic medicine. In a system where mental phenomena and biochemical events take place in the same field, it is much easier to account for how ways of thinking affect the body. If one idea is central to yoga psychology, it is that thoughts are real and have real, tangible consequences, as we saw in the discussion of karma. Sankhya describes thoughts as packets of potential energy, which grow more and more solid when favorable conditions are present and obstacles are removed. They become desires, then habits, then ways of living with physical consequences. Those consequences may look no more like thoughts than an oak tree looks like an acorn, but the Gita says they are just as intimately related. Just as a seed can grow into only one kind of tree, thoughts can produce effects only of the same nature. Kindness to others, to take just one example, favors a nervous system that is kind to itself. The Forces of Evolution  Sankhya describes prakriti as a field of forces called gunas – a concept that gets a good deal of attention in the Gita. According to Sankhya, the evolution of primordial prakriti into mind and matter begins when the equilibrium of prakriti is disturbed. In Hindu myth this is the dawn of the Day of Brahma (8:17–21), a period of explosive expansion not unlike the Big Bang of modern cosmology. At this instant of creation, thrown into imbalance, prakriti differentiates itself into three basic states or qualities of primordial energy. These are the gunas. Every state of matter and mind is a combination of these three: tamas, inertia, rajas, activity, and sattva, harmony or equilibrium. These are only rough translations, for the gunas have no equivalent in any other philosophy I know. The gunas can be illustrated by comparison with the three states of matter in classical physics: solid, liquid, and gas. Tamas is frozen energy, the resistance of inertia. A block of ice has a good deal of energy in the chemical bonds that hold it together, but the energy is locked in, bound up, rigid. When the ice melts, some of that energy is released as the water flows; rajas, activity, is like a swollen river, full of uncontrolled power. And sattva, harmony, can be compared with steam when its power is harnessed. These are very imprecise parallels, but they convey an important point  \fabout the gunas: all three are states of energy, and each can be converted into the others. Guna means strand, and in the Gita the gunas are described as the very fabric of existence, the veil that hides unity in a covering of diversity. Tamas is maya’s power of concealment, the darkness or ignorance that hides unitive reality; rajas distracts and scatters awareness, turning it away from reality toward the diversity of the outside world. Thus the gunas are essentially born of the mind. When the mind’s activity is stilled, we see life as it is. We can also think of the gunas as different levels of consciousness. Tamas, the lowest level, is the vast unconscious, a chaotic dumping ground for the residue of past mental states. “Unconscious” in this sense has something in common with Jung’s collective unconscious, in that it is the repository not only of past experiences but also of our evolutionary heritage, the basic drives of the human being’s animal past. This record is shared, of course, by all human beings, and at its deepest levels the unconscious is universal. There is no choice in tamas, no awareness; this is complete ignorance of the unity of life, ignorance of any other need than one’s own basic urges. Rajas is what we ordinarily mean by mind, the incessant stream of thought that races along, desiring, worrying, resenting, scheming, competing, frustrating and getting frustrated. Rajas is power released, but uncontrolled and egocentric. Sattva, finally, is the so-called higher mind – detached, unruffled, selfcontrolled. This is not a state of repressive regulation, but the natural harmony that comes with unity of purpose, character, and desire. Negative states of mind do still come up, prompted by tamas and rajas, but there is no need to act on them. According to Sankhya, everything in the world of mind and matter is an expression of all three gunas, with one guna always predominant. This becomes particularly interesting in describing personality as a field of forces. The rajasic person is full of energy; the tamasic person is sluggish, indifferent, insensitive; the sattvic person, calm, resourceful, compassionate, and selfless. Yet all three are always present at some level of awareness, and their proportions change: their interplay is the dynamics of personality. The same individual will have times when he is bursting with energy and times when inertia descends and paralyzes his will, times  \fwhen he is thoughtful and other times when he is moving so fast that he never notices those around him. The person is the same; he is simply experiencing the play of the gunas. As long as he identifies with his body and mind, he is at the mercy of this play. But the Self is not involved in the gunas’ interaction; it is witness rather than participant: Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. (13:14) The gunas form the basis of the most compassionate account of human nature I have come across in any philosophy or psychology, East or West. They not only explain differences in character; they describe the basic forces of personality and allow the possibility of reshaping ourselves after a higher ideal. Because personality is a process, the human being is constantly remaking himself or herself. Left to itself, the mind goes on repeating the same old habitual patterns of personality. By training the mind, however, anyone can learn to step in and change old ways of thinking; that is the central principle of yoga: Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. (6:5) The Gita speaks of this kind of growth as part of spiritual evolution. In its natural state, consciousness is a continuous flow of awareness. But through the distorting action of the gunas, we have fallen from this native state into fragmented, sometimes stagnant awareness. Seeing through a divided mind, we see life divided wherever we look: separate selves, antagonistic interests, conflicts within ourselves. Evolution, according to the Gita, is a painfully slow return to our native state. First tamas must be transformed into rajas – apathy and insensitiveness into energetic, enthusiastic activity. But the energy of rajas is self-centered and dispersed; it must be harnessed to a higher ideal by the will. Then it becomes sattva, when all this passionate energy is channeled into selfless action. This state is marked by happiness, a calm mind, abundant vitality, and the concentration of genius. But even this is not the end. The goal of evolution is to return to unity: that is, to still the mind. Then the soul rests in pure, unitary consciousness,  \fwhich is a state of permanent joy. In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. (6:20) THE ESSENCE OF THE GITA  The Gita does not present a system of philosophy. It offers something to every seeker after God, of whatever temperament, by whatever path. The reason for this universal appeal is that it is basically practical: it is a handbook for Self-realization and a guide to action. Some scholars will find practicality a tall claim, because the Gita is full of lofty and even abstruse philosophy. Yet even its philosophy is not there to satisfy intellectual curiosity; it is meant to explain to spiritual aspirants why they are asked to undergo certain disciplines. Like any handbook, the Gita makes most sense when it is practiced. As the traditional chapter titles put it, the Gita is brahmavidyayam yogashastra, a textbook on the supreme science of yoga. But yoga is a word with many meanings – as many, perhaps, as there are paths to Selfrealization. What kind of yoga does the Gita teach? The common answer is that it presents three yogas or even four – the four main paths of Hindu mysticism. In jnana yoga, the yoga of knowledge, aspirants use their will and discrimination to disidentify themselves from the body, mind, and senses until they know they are nothing but the Self. The followers of bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion, achieve the same goal by identifying themselves completely with the Lord in love; by and large, this is the path taken by most of the mystics of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. In karma yoga, the yoga of selfless action, the aspirants dissolve their identification with body and mind by identifying with the whole of life, forgetting the finite self in the service of others. And the followers of raja yoga, the yoga of meditation, discipline the mind and senses until the mind-process is suspended in a healing stillness and they merge in the Self. Indians like to classify, and the eighteen chapters of the Gita are said to break into three six-chapter parts. The first third, according to this, deals with karma yoga, the second with jnana yoga, and the last with bhakti yoga: that is, the Gita begins with the way of selfless action, passes into the way of Self-knowledge, and ends with the way of love. This scheme is not tight,  \fand non-Hindu readers may find it difficult to discover in the text. But the themes are there, and Krishna clearly shifts his emphasis as he goes on using this one word yoga. Here he focuses on transcendental knowledge, there on selfless action, here on meditation, there on love. Thus the Gita offers something for every kind of spiritual aspirant, and for two thousand years each of the major schools of Indian philosophy has quoted the Gita in defense of its particular claims. This fluidity sometimes exasperates scholars, who feel the Gita contradicts itself. It also puzzled Arjuna, the faithful representative of you and me. “Krishna,” he says at the beginning of chapter 3, “you’ve been telling me that knowledge [jnana] is better than action [karma]; so why do you urge me into such terrible action? Your words are inconsistent; they confuse me. Tell me one path to the highest good” (3:1–2). No doubt he speaks for every reader at this point, and for those who go on wanting one path only, the confusion simply grows worse. For those who try to practice the Gita, however, there is a thread of inner consistency running through Krishna’s advice. Like a person walking around the same object, the Gita takes more than one point of view. Whenever Krishna describes one of the traditional paths to God he looks at it from the inside, extolling its virtues over the others. For the time being, that is the path; when he talks about yoga, he means that one particular yoga. Thus “this ancient word” yoga, says Gandhi’s intimate friend and secretary, Mahadev Desai, is pressed by the Gita into service to mean the entire gamut of human endeavor to storm the gates of heaven. . . . [It means] the yoking of all the powers of the body and the mind and soul to God; it means the discipline of the intellect, the mind, the emotions, the will, which such a yoking presupposes; it means a poise of the soul which enables one to look at life in all its aspects and evenly. The Gita brings together all the specialized senses of the word yoga to emphasize their common meaning: the sum of what one must do to realize the Self. The thread through Krishna’s teaching, the essence of the Gita, can be given in one word: renunciation. This is the common factor in the four yogas. It is a bleak word in English, conjuring up the austerity and self-  \fdeprivation enjoined on the monastic orders – the “poverty, chastity, and obedience” so perfectly embodied by Francis of Assisi. When the Gita promises “freedom through renunciation,” the impression most of us get is that we are being asked to give up everything we want out of life; in this drab state, having lost whatever we value, we will be free from sorrow. Who wants that kind of freedom? But this is not at all what the Gita means. It does not even enjoin material renunciation, although it certainly encourages simplicity. As always, its emphasis is on the mind. It teaches that we can become free by giving up not material things, but selfish attachments to material things – and, more important, to people. It asks us to renounce not the enjoyment of life, but the clinging to selfish enjoyment whatever it may cost others. It pleads, in a word, for the renunciation of selfishness in thought, word, and action – a theme that is common to all mystics, West and East alike. Mahatma Gandhi encapsulates the Gita’s message in one phrase: nishkama karma, selfless action, work free from any selfish motives. In this special sense, whatever path the Gita is presenting at a given time, it remains essentially a manual of karma yoga, for it is addressed to the person who wants to realize God without giving up an active life in the world. In the Gita the four traditional yogas are not watertight compartments, and in practice, all of them blend and support each other on the path to Self-realization. Nishkama karma means literally work that is without kama, that is, without selfish desire. This word kama – indeed the whole idea of desire in Hindu and Buddhist psychology – is frequently misunderstood. These religions, it is sometimes held, teach an ideal of desireless action, a nirvana equated with the extinction of all desires. This drab view is far from the truth. Desire is the fuel of life; without desire nothing can be achieved, let alone so stupendous a feat as Self-realization. Kama is not desire; it is selfish desire. The Buddha calls it tanha,“ thirst”: the fierce, compulsive craving for personal satisfaction that demands to be slaked at any cost, whether to oneself or to others. Thus the concept also includes what Western mystics call self-will – the naked ego insisting on getting what it wants for its own gratification. The Gita teaches simply that this selfish craving is what makes a person feel separate from the rest of life. When it is extinguished – the literal meaning of nirvana – the mask of the transient, petty empirical ego falls, revealing our real Self.  \fWork hard in the world without any selfish attachment, the Gita counsels, and you will purify your consciousness of self-will. In this way any man or woman can gradually attain freedom from the bondage of selfish conditioning. This is a mental discipline, not just a physical one, and I want to repeat that to understand the Gita, it is important to look beneath the surface of its injunctions and see the mental state involved. Nishkama karma is not “good works” or philanthropic activity; work can benefit others and still carry a substantial measure of ego involvement. Such work is good, but it is not yoga. It may benefit others, but it will not necessarily benefit the doer. Everything depends on the state of mind. Action without selfish motive purifies the mind: the doer is less likely to be ego-driven later. The same action done with a selfish motive entangles a person further, precisely by strengthening that motive so it is more likely to prompt selfish action again. In the Gita this is said in many ways, and from differences in language it may seem that Krishna is giving different pieces of advice. In practice, however, it becomes evident that these are only various ways of saying the same thing. To begin with, Krishna often tells Arjuna to “renounce the fruits of action” (karma-phala): You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself – without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. (2:47–48) “Fruits,” of course, means the outcome. What Krishna means is to give up attachment to the results of what you do: that is, to give your best to every undertaking without insisting that the results work out the way you want, or even whether what you do is pleasant or unpleasant. “You have the right to action, but not to the fruits of action”: each of us has the obligation to act rightly, but no power to dictate what is to come of what we do. Mahatma Gandhi explains with the authority of his personal experience: By detachment I mean that you must not worry whether the desired result follows from your action or not, so long as your motive is pure,  \fyour means correct. Really, it means that things will come right in the end if you take care of the means and leave the rest to Him. “But renunciation of fruit,” Gandhi warns, in no way means indifference to the result. In regard to every action one must know the result that is expected to follow, the means thereto, and the capacity for it. He who, being thus equipped, is without desire for the result and is yet wholly engrossed in the due fulfillment of the task before him, is said to have renounced the fruits of his action. This attitude frees us completely. Whatever comes – success or failure, praise or blame, victory or defeat – we can give our best with a clear, unruffled mind. Nothing can shake our courage or break our will; no setback can depress us or make us feel “burned out.” Clearly, as the Gita says, “Yoga is skill in action” (2:50). Only the person who is utterly detached and utterly dedicated, Gandhi says, is free to enjoy life. Asked to sum up his life “in twenty-five words or less,” he replied, “I can do it in three!” and quoted the Isha Upanishad: “Renounce and enjoy.” Those who are compulsively attached to the results of action cannot really enjoy what they do; they get downcast when things do not work out and cling more desperately when they do. So the Gita classifies the karma of attachment as pleasant at first, but “bitter as poison in the end” (18:38), because of the painful bondage of conditioning. Again, Krishna repeatedly tells Arjuna to surrender everything to him in love. But this is not different advice, merely different words. Krishna is asking Arjuna to act entirely for His sake, not for any personal gain. The whole point of the path of love is to transform motivation from “I, I, I” to “thou, thou, thou” – that is, to surrender selfish attachments by dissolving them in the desire to give. Krishna puts this most beautifully in the famous verses of Chapter 9 which begin, “Whatever you do, make it an offering to me” (9:27). Do it, that is, not for personal reward but out of love for the Lord, present in every creature. “Whatever you eat, whatever worship you perform, whatever you give, whatever you suffer”: everything is to be done and given and endured and enjoyed for the sake of the Lord in all, not for ourselves. Manmana: this is the refrain of the Gita. Krishna tells Arjuna repeatedly, “Fill your  \fmind with me, focus every thought on me, think of me always”; then “you will be united with me” (see 9:34). The same injunction was given to Moses and reiterated by Jesus and Mohammed. In practical terms, it means that awareness will be integrated down to the deepest recesses of the unconscious, which is precisely the significance of the word yoga. Meister Eckhart says eloquently of this state: Whoever has God in mind, simply and solely God, in all things, such a man carries God with him into all his works and into all places, and God alone does all his works. He seeks nothing but God; nothing seems good to him but God. He becomes one with God in every thought. Just as no multiplicity can dissipate God, so nothing can dissipate this man or make him multiple. Thus we arrive at the idea of “actionless action”: of persons so established in identification with the Self that in the midst of tireless service of those around them, they remain in inner peace, the still witness of action. They do not act, the Gita says; it is the Self that acts through them: “They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved” (13:29). Again, this is a universal testimony. Here is one of the most active of mystics, St. Catherine of Genoa: When the soul is naughted and transformed, then of herself she neither works nor speaks nor wills, nor feels nor hears nor understands; neither has she of herself the feeling of outward or inward, where she may move. And in all things it is God who rules and guides her, without the mediation of any creature. And the state of this soul is then a feeling of such utter peace and tranquility that it seems to her that her heart, and her bodily being, and all both within and without, is immersed in an ocean of utmost peace. . . . And she is so full of peace that though she press her flesh, her nerves, her bones, no other thing comes forth from them than peace. Again, when the Gita talks about “inaction in the midst of action” (4:18, etc.), we can call on Ruysbroeck to illumine the seeming paradox. The person who has realized God, he says, mirrors both His aspects: “tranquility according to His essence, activity according to His nature: absolute repose, absolute fecundity.” And he adds,  \fThe interior person lives his life according to these two ways; that is to say, in rest and in work. And in each of them he is wholly and undividedly; for he dwells wholly in God in virtue of his restful fruition and wholly in himself in virtue of his active love. . . . This is the supreme summit of the inner life. This is the only kind of inaction the Gita recommends. It is action of the most tireless kind; the only thing inactive is the ego. To live without the daily sacrifice (yajna) of selfless service – to work just for oneself, or worse, to do nothing at all – is simply to be a thief (3:12). It is not possible to do nothing, Krishna says; the very nature of the mind is incessant activity. The Gita’s goal is to harness this activity in selfless service, removing the poisonous agency of the ego: “As long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward” (18:11). Meister Eckhart explains, To be right, a person must do one of two things: either he must learn to have God in his work and hold fast to him there, or he must give up his work altogether. Since, however, man cannot live without activities that are both human and various, we must learn to keep God in everything we do, and whatever the job or place, keep on with him, letting nothing stand in our way. It would be difficult to find a better summary of the Gita’s message anywhere – and this, incidentally, from someone considered to represent the path of knowledge. Krishna wraps all this up in one famous verse: “Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve” (18:66). Krishna is the Self; the words mean simply to cast aside external props and dependencies and rely on the Self alone, seeking strength nowhere but within. Why does selfless action lead to Self-realization? It is not a matter of “good” action being divinely rewarded. Self-realization is not some kind of compensation for good deeds. We can understand the dynamics if we remember that the Gita’s emphasis is on the mind. Most human activity, good and bad, is tainted by ego-involvement. Such activity cannot purify consciousness, because it goes on generating new karma in the mind – in  \fpractical terms, we go on getting entangled in what we do. Selfless work purifies consciousness because when there is no trace of ego involvement, new karma is not produced; the mind is simply working out the karma it has already accumulated. Shankara illustrates this with the simile of a potter’s wheel. The ego’s job is to go on incessantly spinning the wheel of the mind and making karmapots: new ideas to act on, fresh desires to pursue. When this pointless activity stops, no more pots are made, but for a while the wheel of the mind goes on spinning out of the momentum of its past karma. This is an anguishing period in the life of every mystic: you have done everything you can; now you can only wait with a kind of impatient patience. Eventually, for no reason that one can understand, the wheel does come to a stop, dissolving the mind-process in samadhi. A HIGHER IMAGE  Perhaps the clearest way to grasp the Gita is to look at the way it describes those who embody its teachings. There are portraits like this at the beginning of the Gita, the middle, and the end, each offering a model of our full human potential. The first is given at the end of chapter 2 (2:54–72), verses which Gandhi said hold the key to the entire Gita. Arjuna has just been told about Selfknowledge; now he asks a very practical question: when a person attains this knowledge, how does it show? How do such people conduct themselves in everyday life? We expect a list of virtues. Instead, Krishna delivers a surprise: the surest sign is that they have banished all selfish desires. Their senses and mind are completely trained, so they are free from sensory cravings and self-will. Identified completely with the Self, not with body or mind, they realize their immortality here on earth. The implications of this are not spelled out; we have to see them in a living person. G. K. Chesterton once said that to understand the Sermon on the Mount, we should look not at Christ but at St. Francis. To understand the Gita I went to look at Mahatma Gandhi, who had done his best for forty years to translate those verses into his daily life. Seeing him, I understood that those “who see themselves in all and all in them” would simply not be capable of harming others. Augustine says daringly, “Love, then do as you like”: nothing will come out of you but goodness. I saw too what it meant to view one’s body with detachment: not indifference, but compassionate care  \fas an instrument of service. I saw what it means to rest in the midst of intense action. Most important, I grasped one of the most refreshing ideas in Hindu mysticism: original goodness. Since the Self is the core of every personality, no one needs to acquire goodness or compassion; they are already there. All that is necessary is to remove the selfish habits that hide them. Chapter 12 gives another portrait in its closing verses (12:13–20), and here we do get an inspiring list of the marks of those who follow the path of love: That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure and pain, patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me – with such as these I am in love. (12:13–14) And finally comes the passionate description with which the Gita ends, when Krishna tells Arjuna how to recognize the man or woman who has reached life’s supreme goal: One who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action. Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom. (18:49–50) These are not separate paths, separate ideals. All three passages describe one person: vital, active, compassionate, self-reliant in the highest sense, for he looks to the Self for everything and needs nothing from life but the opportunity to give. In brief, such a person knows who he is, and in that knowing is everything. This is not running away from life, as is so often claimed. It is running into life, open-handed, open-armed: “flying, running, and rejoicing,” says Thomas à Kempis, for “he is free and will not be bound,” never entangled in self-doubts, conflict, or vacillation. Far from being desireless – look at Gandhi, St. Catherine of Siena, St. Teresa, St. Francis – the man or woman who realizes God has yoked all human passions to the overriding desire to give and love and serve; and in that unification we can see, not the  \fextinction of personality, but its full blossoming. This is what it means to be fully human; our ordinary lives of stimulus and response, getting and spending, seem by comparison as faint as remembered dreams. This flowering of the spirit appeals, I think, to everyone. “This is the true joy in life,” says Bernard Shaw: the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; . . . the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. Instead of “Nature” with a capital N, of course, the Gita would say “an instrument of the Self”; but that is the only difference. One of the most appealing features of the Gita for our times is that it clears up misunderstandings about the spiritual life and shows it for what it is: active, joyful, intentional, a middle path between extremes that transfigures everyday living. FAITH AND SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION  One last untranslatable concept and I will let the Gita speak for itself. That concept is shraddha, and its nearest English equivalent is faith. I have translated it as such, but shraddha means much more. It is literally “that which is placed in the heart”: all the beliefs we hold so deeply that we never think to question them. It is the set of values, axioms, prejudices, and prepossessions that colors our perceptions, governs our thinking, dictates our responses, and shapes our lives, generally without our even being aware of its presence and power. This may sound philosophical, but shraddha is not an intellectual abstraction. It is our very substance. The Gita says, “A person is what his shraddha is” (17:3). The Bible uses almost the same words: “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” Shraddha reflects everything that we have made ourselves and points to what we have become. But there is nothing passive about shraddha. It is full of potency, for it prompts action, conditions behavior, and determines how we see and therefore respond to the world around us. When Norman Cousins talks about a “belief system” analogous to the body’s organ systems, that is one aspect of shraddha; he is referring to the  \fpower to heal or harm that is inherent in our ideas of ourselves. One person with a serious illness believes he has a contribution to make to the world and so he recovers; another believes his life is worthless and he dies: that is the power of shraddha. Similarly, self-image is part of shraddha. One person believes she will succeed in life and overcomes great obstacles; another, who believes she can do nothing, may be more gifted and face fewer difficulties but accomplish very little. Yet shraddha is not brute determination or wishful thinking. When St. John of the Cross says “We live in what we love,” he is explaining shraddha. This is our world. Our lives are an eloquent expression of our belief: what we deem worth having, doing, attaining, being. What we strive for shows what we value; we back our shraddha with our time, our energy, our very lives. Thus shraddha determines destiny. As the Buddha puts it, “All that we are is the result of what we have thought. We are made of our thoughts; we are molded by our thoughts.” As we think, so we become. This is true not only of individuals but of societies, institutions, and civilizations, according to the dominant ideas that shape their actions. Faith in technology, for example, is part of the shraddha of modern civilization. “Right shraddha,” according to the Gita, is faith in spiritual laws: in the unity of life, the presence of divinity in every person, the essentially spiritual nature of the human being. “Wrong shraddha” is not necessarily morally wrong, merely ignorant. It means believing that there is no more to life than physical existence, that the human being is only a biochemical entity, that happiness can be got by pursuing private interests and ignoring the rest of life. Such beliefs are misplaced: we have attached our shraddha to beliefs that life cannot bear out. Sooner or later they must prove false, and then our shraddha changes. Like our thinking, therefore – like we ourselves – shraddha evolves. The purpose of karma is to teach the consequences of shraddha, so that by trial and error, life after life, the individual soul acquires the kind of faith that leads to fulfillment of life’s supreme goal. Krishna explains the dynamics: When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that. Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. (7:21– 22)  \fThis is perhaps the most compassionate insight into human evolution ever expressed. The Gita is steeped in it, but it is not exclusive to the Gita or to Hinduism. “Whether you like it or not, whether you know it or not,” says Meister Eckhart, “secretly Nature seeks and hunts and tries to ferret out the track in which God may be found.” The whole purpose of every experience, every activity, every faculty, is to turn the human being inward and lead each of us back to our divine source. Thus every person seeking satisfaction in the world outside – pleasure, power, profit, prestige – is really looking for God: “As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me” (4:11). Two forces pervade human life, the Gita says: the upward thrust of evolution and the downward pull of our evolutionary past. Ultimately, then, the Gita is not a book of commandments but a book of choices. It does mention sin, but mostly it talks about ignorance and its consequences. Krishna tells Arjuna about the Self, the forces of the mind, the relationship between thought and action, the law of karma, and then concludes, “Now, Arjuna, reflect on these words and then do as you choose” (18:63). The struggle is between two halves of human nature, and choices are posed every moment. Everyone who has accepted this challenge, I think, will testify that life offers no fiercer battle than this war within. We have no choice about the fighting; it is built into human nature. But we do have the choice of which side to fight on: Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. If you egotistically say, “I will not fight this battle,” your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. (18:58–59) Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. (8:7) Thus the Gita places human destiny entirely in human hands. Its world is not deterministic, but neither is it an expression of blind chance: we shape ourselves and our world by what we believe and think and act on, whether for good or for ill. In this sense the Gita opens not on Kurukshetra but on dharmakshetra, the field of dharma, where Arjuna and Krishna are standing for us all.  \fChapter One  The War Within Sri Krishna consoles and instructs Prince Arjuna as he is about to go into battle against family and friends to defend his older brother’s claim to the ancient throne of the Kurus. Thus the great scripture called Bhagavad Gita, the “Song of the Lord,” begins. Sri Krishna is Bhagavan, “the Lord,” the mysterious incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the aspect of God who fosters and preserves the universe against the forces constantly working to destroy and corrupt it. Krishna has appeared on earth as a royal prince of the house of the Yadavas; thus he combines earthly majesty with a hidden spiritual power. Most know him only as an unimportant prince, but the wise have seen him reveal his power to destroy evil and protect the good. The battle of the Bhagavad Gita is not Krishna’s fight, however; it is Arjuna’s. Krishna is only Arjuna’s charioteer and advisor. He has promised Arjuna that he will be with him throughout the ordeal, but much as he passionately hopes for Arjuna’s victory, he has sworn to be a noncombatant in the struggle. A charioteer’s position is a lowly one compared to the status and glory of the warrior he drives, but Krishna assumes this modest role out of love for Arjuna. As charioteer, he is in a perfect position to give advice and encouragement to Arjuna without violating his promise not to join the fight himself. To secure their claim to the throne, Arjuna and his brothers must fight not an alien army but their own cousins, who have held the kingdom for many years. Tragically, the forces against them include their own uncle, the blind king Dhritarashtra, and even the revered teachers and elders who guided Arjuna and his brothers when they were young. Arjuna, of course, wants to win the throne for his brother, who is the rightful heir to the Kuru dynasty and has endured many wrongs. But he is dismayed at the prospect of fighting his own people. Thus, on the morning the great battle is to begin, he turns to Krishna, his friend and spiritual advisor, and asks him the deeper questions about life that he has never asked before. The Bhagavad Gita is Krishna’s answer. Other warriors who appear elsewhere in the drama are mentioned in this first chapter of the Gita. To Indians these are familiar figures from the  \flegendary past, but to most Western readers they will be unknown and even unpronounceable names. Arjuna and his brothers are known as the Pandavas, “the sons of Pandu”: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Sahadeva, and Nakula. The other side is called the Kauravas, “the sons of Kuru.” This is somewhat misleading, for both sides of the royal family are Kurus by birth. But the Pandavas are now in the position of appearing to be the dissident faction, so they are called “sons of Pandu” to distinguish them from the larger family. Pandu was once king of the kingdom of Hastinapura, but he retired into the forest on spiritual retreat and died young. His elder brother, Dhritarashtra, was blind since birth, so he was never named ruler, but he did share power with his brother. When Pandu died his eldest son, Yudhishthira, should have succeeded him; but because Yudhishthira was only a boy, Dhritarashtra continued on after Pandu’s death. As time passed, however, Dhritarashtra’s attachment to his own eldest son, Duryodhana, gradually overcame him. Instead of rising to royal impartiality and allowing Yudhishthira his fair claim, the old, blind king began to connive at his son’s demand to succeed to the throne. Actually, the line of succession had grown convoluted over several generations, and it was not unthinkable that Duryodhana should rule next. But Yudhishthira’s outstanding qualities and Duryodhana’s corruption gradually decided the issue, at least from the moral point of view. For Duryodhana, the conflict could be resolved only on the battlefield. Other warriors are mentioned briefly in chapter 1. Two particularly important figures in the Mahabharata story are Drona and Bhishma. Drona was born a brahmin, a member of the priestly caste, but in search of wealth he took up the way of the warrior and excelled in the knowledge of arms. He was the teacher, the guru, of all the royal princes in their youth, the sons of Pandu and the sons of Dhritarashtra alike. Thus it was he who taught both sides the skills of war – an irony which sharp-tongued Duryodhana points out in verse 3. Arjuna was Drona’s best pupil when it came to the bow, excelling even Drona’s own son, Ashvatthama. Bhishma, “the grandsire” of both sides, is not actually the princes’ grandfather but a respected elder statesman. As Dhritarashtra’s advisor of many years’ standing, he considers it his duty to stand by his king and try to protect him from his weaknesses and wrong decisions.  \fAnother figure introduced in chapter 1 is Sanjaya, who narrates the entire Gita to the blind king Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya is not present on the battlefield, but the text tells us that the sage Vyasa, the composer of the Gita, has given him divine sight so that he can see and report everything. Chapter 1 leaves us acutely aware that we are on a battlefield, waiting for a catastrophic war to begin; but once Krishna begins his instruction, we leave the battlefield behind and enter the realms of philosophy and mystical vision. The first chapter is but a bridge to the real subjects of the Gita, and thus need not detain us too long in our study of the poem. Yet the first chapter has caused a great deal of debate, largely because of what it has to say about the morality of war. Basically there have been two points of view, which are almost (but perhaps not completely) irreconcilable. First, there is the orthodox Hindu viewpoint that the Gita condones war for the warrior class: it is the dharma, the moral duty, of soldiers to fight in a good cause, though never for evil leaders. (It should be added that this is part of an elaborate and highly chivalrous code prescribing the just rules of war.) According to this orthodox view, the lesson of the Mahabharata (and therefore of the Gita) is that although war is evil, it is an evil that cannot be avoided – an evil both tragic and honorable for the warrior himself. War in a just cause, justly waged, is also in accord with the divine will. Because of this, in the Mahabharata, Yudhishthira and his noble brothers find their peace in the next world when they have finished their duty on earth. The mystics’ point of view is more subtle. For them the battle is an allegory, a cosmic struggle between good and evil. Krishna has revealed himself on earth to reestablish righteousness, and he is asking Arjuna to engage in a spiritual struggle, not a worldly one. According to this interpretation, Arjuna is asked to fight not his kith and kin but his own lower self. Mahatma Gandhi, who based his daily life on the Gita from his twenties on, felt it would be impossible to live the kind of life taught in the Gita and still engage in violence. To argue that the Gita condones violence, he said, was to give importance only to its opening verses – its preface, so to speak – and ignore the scripture itself. For some, it helps clarify this question to look upon the Gita as an Upanishad, a mystical statement from the Vedas, that was incorporated into the warrior epic of a later age. Chapter 1 of the Gita then forms a rather  \fperilous bridge between the warrior’s world and the essential part of the Gita – Sri Krishna’s revelations of spiritual truth. –D.M.  \f1: The War Within DHRITARASHTRA  O Sanjaya, tell me what happened at Kurukshetra, the field of dharma, where my family and the Pandavas gathered to fight. 1  SANJAYA  Having surveyed the forces of the Pandavas arrayed for battle, prince Duryodhana approached his teacher, Drona, and spoke. 3 “O my teacher, look at this mighty army of the Pandavas, assembled by your own gifted disciple, Yudhishthira. 4 There are heroic warriors and great archers who are the equals of Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana, Virata, the mighty Drupada, 5 Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja,the great leader Shaibya, 6 the powerful Yudhamanyu, the valiant Uttamaujas, and the son of Subhadra, in addition to the sons of Draupadi. All these command mighty chariots. 2  “O best of brahmins, listen to the names of those who are distinguished among our own forces: 8 Bhishma, Karna, and the victorious Kripa; Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta. 7  “There are many others, too, heroes giving up their lives for my sake, all proficient in war and armed with a variety of weapons. 10 Our army is unlimited and commanded by Bhishma; theirs is small and commanded by Bhima. 11 Let everyone take his proper place and stand firm supporting Bhishma!” 9  Then the powerful Bhishma, the grandsire, oldest of all the Kurus, in order to cheer Duryodhana, roared like a lion and blew his 12  \fconch horn. 13 And after Bhishma, a tremendous noise arose of conchs and cow horns and pounding on drums. Then Sri Krishna and Arjuna, who were standing in a mighty chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conchs. 15 Sri Krishna blew the conch named Panchajanya, and Arjuna blew that called Devadatta. The mighty Bhima blew the huge conch Paundra. 16 Yudhishthira, the king, the son of Kunti, blew the conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conchs as well. 17 Then the king of Kashi, the leading bowman, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the invincible Satyaki, 18 Drupada, all the sons of Draupadi, and the strong-armed son of Subhadra joined in, 19 and the noise tore through the heart of Duryodhana’s army. Indeed, the sound was tumultuous, echoing throughout heaven and earth. 14  Then, O Dhritarashtra, lord of the earth, having seen your son’s forces set in their places and the fighting about to begin, Arjuna spoke these words to Sri Krishna: 20  ARJUNA  O Krishna, drive my chariot between the two armies. 22 I want to see those who desire to fight with me. With whom will this battle be fought? 23 I want to see those assembled to fight for Duryodhana, those who seek to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra by engaging in war. 21  SANJAYA  Thus Arjuna spoke, and Sri Krishna, driving his splendid chariot between the two armies, 25 facing Bhishma and Drona and all the kings of the earth, said: “Arjuna, behold all the Kurus gathered together.” 24  And Arjuna, standing between the two armies, saw fathers and grandfathers, teachers, uncles, and brothers, sons and grandsons, 27 in-laws and friends. Seeing his kinsmen established in opposition, 28 Arjuna was overcome by sorrow. Despairing, he spoke these words: 26  \fARJUNA  O Krishna, I see my own relations here anxious to fight, 29 and my limbs grow weak; my mouth is dry, my body shakes, and my hair is standing on end. 30 My skin burns, and the bow Gandiva has slipped from my hand. I am unable to stand; my mind seems to be whirling. 31 These signs bode evil for us. I do not see that any good can come from killing our relations in battle. 32 O Krishna, I have no desire for victory, or for a kingdom or pleasures. Of what use is a kingdom or pleasure or even life, 33 if those for whose sake we desire these things – 34 teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, in-laws, grandsons, and others with family ties – are engaging in this battle, renouncing their wealth and their lives? 35 Even if they were to kill me, I would not want to kill them, not even to become ruler of the three worlds. How much less for the earth alone? O Krishna, what satisfaction could we find in killing Dhritarashtra’s sons? We would become sinners by slaying these men, even though they are evil. 37 The sons of Dhritarashtra are related to us; therefore, we should not kill them. How can we gain happiness by killing members of our own family? 36  Though they are overpowered by greed and see no evil in destroying families or injuring friends, we see these evils. 39 Why shouldn’t we turn away from this sin? 40 When a family declines, ancient traditions are destroyed. With them are lost the spiritual foundations for life, and the family loses its sense of unity. 41 Where there is no sense of unity, the women of the family become corrupt; and with the corruption of its women, society is plunged into chaos. 42 Social chaos is hell for the family and for those who have destroyed the family as well. It disrupts the process of spiritual evolution begun by our ancestors. 43 The timeless spiritual foundations of family and society would be destroyed by these terrible deeds, which violate the unity of life. 38  It is said that those whose family dharma has been destroyed dwell in hell. 45 This is a great sin! We are prepared to kill our own relations out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. 46 Better for 44  \fme if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, were to attack me in battle and kill me unarmed and unresisting. SANJAYA  Overwhelmed by sorrow, Arjuna spoke these words. And casting away his bow and his arrows, he sat down in his chariot in the middle of the battlefield. 47  \fChapter Two  Self-Realization As Arjuna’s spiritual teacher, Sri Krishna’s task now is to rouse Arjuna from his despair and set him on the way to Self-realization. Arjuna is essentially a man of action, renowned for his bravery, nobility, and skill in the arts of war – intelligent, but not given to reflection. Yet in his present crisis, he finds that the active life is not enough. He is forced to ask the perennial questions about life and death: Does he have a soul? Does it survive death? Is there a deeper reality than we perceive in the world around us? If so, is it possible to know it directly, and (for Arjuna is always practical) what effect does such knowing have in everyday life? In his answer, Krishna touches on almost all the main themes and concepts of the Gita. Chapter 2 is thus a kind of overview of the sixteen chapters to come. Sri Krishna begins by reminding Arjuna of his immortal nature: his real Self, the Atman, never dies, for it is never born; it is eternal. Thus the Gita does not lead us from stage to stage of spiritual awareness, but begins with the ultimate premise: the immortal soul is more important than the passing world. Knowing he is out of his depth in these inner realms of the mind and spirit, Arjuna formally asks Krishna to be his spiritual teacher or guru. This is a basic prerequisite of a disciple’s initiation in the Hindu tradition, where it is believed that virtually all seekers need the guidance of an experienced teacher. Arjuna is no exception, and he is fortunate to have Krishna himself as his guru. In the allegorical sense, Krishna is a symbol of the Atman, Arjuna’s deepest Self. This chapter introduces the idea of rebirth or samsara. The Self wears the body as a garment; when the garment is old, it is cast aside and a new one is put on. Thus the soul, or jiva, travels from life to life. Just as death is certain for the living, rebirth is certain for the dead. Krishna assures Arjuna that his basic nature is not subject to time and death; yet he reminds him that he cannot realize this truth if he cannot see beyond the dualities of life: pleasure and pain, success and failure, even heat and cold. The Gita does not teach a spirituality aimed at an enjoyable life in the hereafter, nor does it  \fteach a way to enhance power in this life or the next. It teaches a basic detachment from pleasure and pain, as this chapter says more than once. Only in this way can an individual rise above the conditioning of life’s dualities and identify with the Atman, the immortal Self. Also, the Gita does not teach an enlightenment based on a knowledge of the scriptures. The important thing is direct mystical experience, which Krishna will later urge Arjuna to acquire for himself. This chapter establishes the various definitions of yoga taught in the Gita. Here the word does not refer to the physical postures and exercises (hatha yoga) it connotes in the West; it refers primarily to disciplining the mind. “Yoga is evenness of mind”: detachment from the dualities of pain and pleasure, success and failure. Therefore “yoga is skill in action,” because this kind of detachment is required if one is to act in freedom, rather than merely react to events compelled by conditioning. Krishna is not trying to persuade Arjuna to lead a different kind of life and renounce the world as would a monk or recluse. He tells Arjuna that if he can establish himself in yoga – in unshakable equanimity, profound peace of mind – he will be more effective in the realm of action. His judgment will be better and his vision clear if he is not emotionally entangled in the outcome of what he does. Arjuna now asks his first question as Krishna’s student. His teacher has been talking about spiritual wisdom: direct, experiential knowledge of the immortal Self. Arjuna wants to know what difference this kind of wisdom makes in everyday life. If a person establishes an ever-present awareness of the core of divinity within himself, how does it affect the way he lives? Arjuna is not interested in what people believe, but in how they conduct themselves in life. Krishna’s answer (2:55 –72 ) is one of the most quoted passages in the Gita. Mahatma Gandhi said these verses contain the essence of the Gita: if the rest of the scripture were lost, this passage alone would be enough to teach a complete way of life. Those who are established in wisdom (sthitaprajna) live in continuous, unbroken awareness that they are not the perishable body but the Atman. Further, they see the same Self in everyone, for the Atman is universally present in all. Such a one, Krishna says, does not identify with personal desires. These desires are on the surface of personality, and the Self is its very core. The Self-realized man or woman is not motivated by personal desires – in other words, by any desire for kama, personal satisfaction. This idea is perhaps  \fforeign to modern ways of thinking, but basic to the Gita – and, indeed, to mystics of all traditions. More specifically, the word kama refers to any gratification of the ego or the senses that entangles us in the world of samsara, and thus draws us away from the core of our being, the Self. Those established in Selfrealization control their senses instead of letting their senses control them. If the senses are not controlled, Krishna warns, the mind (or emotions) will follow wherever they lead. Eventually a person following the senses loses strength of will and unity of purpose; his choices are dictated by his desires. When the will is led astray by the desire for pleasure, the mind becomes confused and scattered. Ultimately, Krishna warns, this leads to spiritual destruction: When you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste. (2:62 –63 ) Yet the Gita does not recommend asceticism. It is more a matter of training the body, mind, and senses. At the very close of the chapter, Krishna introduces the idea that it is not enough to master all selfish desires; it is also necessary to subdue possessiveness and egocentricity. If this ultimate bourne can be passed, then the seeker will know the true, immortal Self within. This is the mystics’ supreme goal: knowing their real nature, they know their own immortality and realize their union with eternal Being. –D.M.  \f2: Self-Realization SANJAYA  These are the words that Sri Krishna spoke to the despairing Arjuna, whose eyes were burning with tears of pity and confusion. 1  KRISHNA  This despair and weakness in a time of crisis are mean and unworthy of you, Arjuna. How have you fallen into a state so far from the path to liberation? 3 It does not become you to yield to this weakness. Arise with a brave heart and destroy the enemy. 2  ARJUNA  How can I ever bring myself to fight against Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of reverence? How can I, Krishna? 5 Surely it would be better to spend my life begging than to kill these great and worthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would be tainted. 6 I don’t even know which would be better, for us to conquer them or for them to conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashtra have confronted us; but why would we care to live if we killed them? 4  My will is paralyzed, and I am utterly confused. Tell me which is the better path for me. Let me be your disciple. I have fallen at your feet; give me instruction. 8 What can overcome a sorrow that saps all my vitality? Even power over men and gods or the wealth of an empire seem empty. 7  SANJAYA  \fThis is how Arjuna, the great warrior, spoke to Sri Krishna. With the words, “O Krishna, I will not fight,” he fell silent. 10 As they stood between the two armies, Sri Krishna smiled and replied to Arjuna, who had sunk into despair. 9  KRISHNA  You speak sincerely, but your sorrow has no cause. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. 12 There has never been a time when you and I and the kings gathered here have not existed, nor will there be a time when we will cease to exist. 13 As the same person inhabits the body through childhood, youth, and old age, so too at the time of death he attains another body. The wise are not deluded by these changes. 11  When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. 15 Those who are unaffected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. Assert your strength and realize this! 14  The impermanent has no reality; reality lies in the eternal. Those who have seen the boundary between these two have attained the end of all knowledge. 17 Realize that which pervades the universe and is indestructible; no power can affect this unchanging, imperishable reality. 18 The body is mortal, but that which dwells in the body is immortal and immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, fight in this battle. 16  One believes he is the slayer, another believes he is the slain. Both are ignorant; there is neither slayer nor slain. 20 You were never born; you will never die. You have never changed; you can never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, you do not die when the body dies. 21 Realizing that which is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and unchanging, how can you slay or cause another to slay? 19  \fAs one abandons worn-out clothes and acquires new ones, so when the body is worn out a new one is acquired by the Self, who lives within. 22  The Self cannot be pierced by weapons or burned by fire; water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it. 24 The Self cannot be pierced or burned, made wet or dry. It is everlasting and infinite, standing on the motionless foundations of eternity. 25 The Self is unmanifested, beyond all thought, beyond all change. Knowing this, you should not grieve. 23  O mighty Arjuna, even if you believe the Self to be subject to birth and death, you should not grieve. 27 Death is inevitable for the living; birth is inevitable for the dead. Since these are unavoidable, you should not sorrow. 28 Every creature is unmanifested at first and then attains manifestation. When its end has come, it once again becomes unmanifested. What is there to lament in this? 26  The glory of the Self is beheld by a few, and a few describe it; a few listen, but many without understanding. 30 The Self of all beings, living within the body, is eternal and cannot be harmed. Therefore, do not grieve. 29  Considering your dharma, you should not vacillate. For a warrior, nothing is higher than a war against evil. 32 The warrior confronted with such a war should be pleased, Arjuna, for it comes as an open gate to heaven. 33 But if you do not participate in this battle against evil, you will incur sin, violating your dharma and your honor. 31  The story of your dishonor will be repeated endlessly: and for a man of honor, dishonor is worse than death. 35 These brave warriors will think you have withdrawn from battle out of fear, and those who formerly esteemed you will treat you with disrespect. 36 Your enemies will ridicule your strength and say things that should not be said. What could be more painful than this? 34  Death means the attainment of heaven; victory means the enjoyment of the earth. Therefore rise up, Arjuna, resolved to fight! 37  \fHaving made yourself alike in pain and pleasure, profit and loss, victory and defeat, engage in this great battle and you will be freed from sin. 38  You have heard the intellectual explanation of Sankhya, Arjuna; now listen to the principles of yoga. By practicing these you can break through the bonds of karma. 40 On this path effort never goes to waste, and there is no failure. Even a little effort toward spiritual awareness will protect you from the greatest fear. 39  Those who follow this path, resolving deep within themselves to seek me alone, attain singleness of purpose. For those who lack resolution, the decisions of life are many-branched and endless. 41  There are ignorant people who speak flowery words and take delight in the letter of the law, saying that there is nothing else. 43 Their hearts are full of selfish desires, Arjuna. Their idea of heaven is their own enjoyment, and the aim of all their activities is pleasure and power. The fruit of their actions is continual rebirth. 44 Those whose minds are swept away by the pursuit of pleasure and power are incapable of following the supreme goal and will not attain samadhi. 42  The scriptures describe the three gunas. But you should be free from the action of the gunas, established in eternal truth, selfcontrolled, without any sense of duality or the desire to acquire and hoard. 45  Just as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is flooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined man or woman, who sees the Lord everywhere. 46  You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. 48 Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself – without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. 47  \fSeek refuge in the attitude of detachment and you will amass the wealth of spiritual awareness. Those who are motivated only by desire for the fruits of action are miserable, for they are constantly anxious about the results of what they do. 50 When consciousness is unified, however, all vain anxiety is left behind. There is no cause for worry, whether things go well or ill. Therefore, devote yourself to the disciplines of yoga, for yoga is skill in action. 49  The wise unify their consciousness and abandon attachment to the fruits of action, which binds a person to continual rebirth. Thus they attain a state beyond all evil. 51  When your mind has overcome the confusion of duality, you will attain the state of holy indifference to things you hear and things you have heard. 53 When you are unmoved by the confusion of ideas and your mind is completely united in deep samadhi, you will attain the state of perfect yoga. 52  ARJUNA  Tell me of those who live established in wisdom, ever aware of the Self, O Krishna. How do they talk? How sit? How move about? 54  KRISHNA  They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them, who have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving tormenting the heart. 55  Neither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live free from lust and fear and anger. Established in meditation, they are truly wise. 57 Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are neither elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. Such are the seers. 56  Even as a tortoise draws in its limbs, the wise can draw in their senses at will. 59 Aspirants abstain from sense pleasures, but they still crave for them. These cravings all disappear when they see the highest goal. 60 Even of those who tread the path, the stormy senses 58  \fcan sweep off the mind. 61 They live in wisdom who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in me. When you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. 63 Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste. 64 But when you move amidst the world of sense, free from attachment and aversion alike, 65 there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you live in the wisdom of the Self. 62  The disunited mind is far from wise; how can it meditate? How be at peace? When you know no peace, how can you know joy? 67 When you let your mind follow the call of the senses, they carry away your better judgment as storms drive a boat off its charted course on the sea. 66  Use all your power to free the senses from attachment and aversion alike, and live in the full wisdom of the Self. 69 Such a sage awakes to light in the night of all creatures. That which the world calls day is the night of ignorance to the wise. 68  As rivers flow into the ocean but cannot make the vast ocean overflow, so flow the streams of the sense-world into the sea of peace that is the sage. But this is not so with the desirer of desires. 70  They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away from the ego-cage of “I,” “me,” and “mine” to be united with the Lord. 72 This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality. 71  \fChapter Three  Selfless Service The title of this chapter in Sanskrit is Karma Yoga, “The Way of Action,” and here we take an apparently sharp turn away from the subject of the previous chapter. In fact, Arjuna changes the subject completely. Krishna has been trying to convince him that he has an immortal soul, but Arjuna continues to worry about his immediate predicament. It is not that he is uninterested in mystical enlightenment, but his main concern at the moment is just what he is supposed to do next. Or, he asks, perhaps what he does is not so important after all. Has Krishna been telling him to concentrate on acquiring spiritual wisdom and to forget about his apparent duties in the world? Krishna replies that there is no way Arjuna can avoid the obligation of selfless action, or karma yoga. Arjuna must act selflessly, out of a sense of duty. He must work not for his own sake, but for the welfare of all. Krishna points out that this is a basic law underlying all creation. Each being must do its part in the grand scheme of things, and there is no way to avoid this obligation – except perhaps by the complete enlightenment which loosens all the old bonds of karma. Here the Gita refers to the doctrine of karma, one of the basic teachings in all Hindu and Buddhist scriptures. Karma literally means deed or action; what is sometimes called the “law of karma” refers to an underlying law of cause and effect that is seen to permeate all existence. The idea is that every action leads to a reasonable result – and, consequently, that everything that happens can be traced to something done in the past. Actions determine destiny: this is the basic idea of karma. If anything happens to us that is truly good, we must have done something in the past to deserve it; if something ill befalls us, then at some time in the past we did something that was not so meritorious. This is a basic moral law that all great spiritual traditions share: the belief that we reap what we sow. The Hindu tradition gave a great deal of thought to this problem of moral cause and effect, and generation after generation of spiritual teachers fathomed its depths and implications. One fear that developed over time was that all action was in a sense an open door to bondage: anything a  \fperson did would bind him to the endless cycle of cause and effect. Some “fruits” of action would of course be pleasant – not all karma is painful. But even this pleasure could be a trap, because we would seek it compulsively, tying ourselves tighter and tighter to the responsibilities and opportunities of the worldly life and forgetting our spiritual dimension altogether. In chapter 3 Krishna begins to tell Arjuna the way out of this maze of cause and effect. It is not to avoid work, especially the duties required by his station in life, but to perform those duties without selfish attachment to their “fruit,” or outcome. If Arjuna follows this path of selfless work, Krishna explains, he will enjoy this world as well as the next. More important, he will gain a spiritual blessing and will be lessening his debt of karma. Only when he is free from every bond of karma – every consequence of past action – can he achieve life’s ultimate goal. The world is bound in its own activity, for all creatures except the illumined man or woman work for their own pleasure and gain. Because they act selfishly, they are bound by the results, whether good or bad. We must act in a selfless spirit, Krishna says, without ego-involvement and without getting entangled in whether things work out the way we want; only then will we not fall into the terrible net of karma. We cannot hope to escape karma by refraining from our duties: even to survive in the world, we must act. True, the Hindu scriptures do hold out another path – jnana yoga, the path of wisdom – which does not enjoin action. But Krishna does not really offer this to Arjuna as an alternative; it is acknowledged and then dropped. Perhaps Krishna knows that Arjuna is not the type to disengage himself and go off on a search for the mystical vision. For Arjuna, the active life is essential. The danger, of course, of a life of active engagement in the world is that Arjuna will get caught up in his actions and begin to act out of selfish motives. If this were to happen, he would be doomed to spiritual failure. Having a good deal of self-knowledge, Arjuna senses this danger. He asks Krishna a fundamental question: What power binds us to our selfish ways? Even if we wish to act rightly, so often we do the wrong thing. What power moves us? Krishna replies that anger and selfish desire are our greatest enemies. They are the destructive powers that can compel us to wander away from our purpose, to end up in self-delusion and despair.  \fHere it is necessary to introduce two technical terms from Hindu philosophy. The Gita is not an academic work of philosophy, but a poetic, practical text. Still, it does refer from time to time to Sankhya, one of the six traditional schools of Indian philosophy. In Sankhya, the phenomenal world of mind and matter is described as having three basic qualities or gunas: sattva– goodness, light, purity; rajas– passion, activity, energy; and tamas– darkness, ignorance, inertia. According to Sankhya, spiritual evolution progresses from tamas to rajas to sattva, and final liberation takes the soul beyond the three gunas altogether. Here Krishna warns Arjuna to beware the pitfalls of rajas, for it is from rajas that anger and selfish desire arise. Arjuna must realize that his true nature, the Atman, is above entanglement in the gunas. The gunas act and react upon one another, but Arjuna’s inner being is not affected. If he cannot reach this detachment, he will be always caught in the emotional storms of passion (rajas) or the quagmires of inertia (tamas) which alternate in dominating the mind and body. Krishna offers Arjuna the example of King Janaka, well known from holy legend, as a model for the princely estate. Janaka was a king who ruled well and did not shirk his responsibilities, yet he was detached and worked from a sense of duty, not for personal gain or enjoyment. He was revered as a royal sage who pursued his enlightenment not by renouncing the world, but by working in it and contributing to its welfare, thus enjoying the best of both worlds. –D.M.  \f3: Selfless Service ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have said that knowledge is greater than action; why then do you ask me to wage this terrible war? 2 Your advice seems inconsistent. Give me one path to follow to the supreme good. 1  KRISHNA  At the beginning of time I declared two paths for the pure heart: jnana yoga, the contemplative path of spiritual wisdom, and karma yoga, the active path of selfless service. 3  One who shirks action does not attain freedom; no one can gain perfection by abstaining from work. 5 Indeed, there is no one who rests for even an instant; all creatures are driven to action by their own nature. 4  Those who abstain from action while allowing the mind to dwell on sensual pleasure cannot be called sincere spiritual aspirants. 7 But they excel who control their senses through the mind, using them for selfless service. 6  Fulfill all your duties; action is better than inaction. Even to maintain your body, Arjuna, you are obliged to act. 9 Selfish action imprisons the world. Act selflessly, without any thought of personal profit. 8  At the beginning, mankind and the obligation of selfless service were created together. “Through selfless service, you will always be 10  \ffruitful and find the fulfillment of your desires”: this is the promise of the Creator. Honor and cherish the devas as they honor and cherish you; through this honor and love you will attain the supreme good. 12 All human desires are fulfilled by the devas, who are pleased by selfless service. But anyone who enjoys the things given by the devas without offering selfless acts in return is a thief. 11  The spiritually minded, who eat in the spirit of service, are freed from all their sins; but the selfish, who prepare food for their own satisfaction, eat sin. 14 Living creatures are nourished by food, and food is nourished by rain; rain itself is the water of life, which comes from selfless worship and service. 13  Every selfless act, Arjuna, is born from Brahman, the eternal, infinite Godhead. Brahman is present in every act of service. 16 All life turns on this law, O Arjuna. Those who violate it, indulging the senses for their own pleasure and ignoring the needs of others, have wasted their life. 17 But those who realize the Self are always satisfied. Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no longer seek happiness from the external world. 18 They have nothing to gain or lose by any action; neither people nor things can affect their security. 15  Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. 20 Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path. 19  What the outstanding person does, others will try to do. The standards such people create will be followed by the whole world. 22 There is nothing in the three worlds for me to gain, Arjuna, nor is there anything I do not have; I continue to act, but I am not driven by any need of my own. 23 If I ever refrained from continuous work, everyone would immediately follow my example. 24 If I stopped working I would be the cause of cosmic chaos, and finally of the destruction of this world and these people. 21  \fThe ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare of the world, without thought for themselves. 26 By abstaining from work you will confuse the ignorant, who are engrossed in their actions. Perform all work carefully, guided by compassion. 25  All actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti. Deluded by identification with the ego, a person thinks, “I am the doer.” 28 But the illumined man or woman understands the domain of the gunas and is not attached. Such people know that the gunas interact with each other; they do not claim to be the doer. 27  Those who are deluded by the operation of the gunas become attached to the results of their action. Those who understand these truths should not unsettle the ignorant. 30 Performing all actions for my sake, completely absorbed in the Self, and without expectations, fight! – but stay free from the fever of the ego. 29  Those who live in accordance with these divine laws without complaining, firmly established in faith, are released from karma. 32 Those who violate these laws, criticizing and complaining, are utterly deluded, and are the cause of their own suffering. 31  Even the wise act within the limitations of their own nature. Every creature is subject to prakriti; what is the use of repression? 34 The senses have been conditioned by attraction to the pleasant and aversion to the unpleasant. Do not be ruled by them; they are obstacles in your path. 33  It is better to strive in one’s own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following one’s own dharma, but competition in another’s dharma breeds fear and insecurity. 35  ARJUNA  What is the force that binds us to selfish deeds, O Krishna? What power moves us, even against our will, as if forcing us? 36  \fKRISHNA  It is selfish desire and anger, arising from the guna of rajas; these are the appetites and evils which threaten a person in this life. 37  Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, just as the embryo rests deep within the womb, knowledge is hidden by selfish desire – 39 hidden, Arjuna, by this unquenchable fire for self-satisfaction, the inveterate enemy of the wise. 38  Selfish desire is found in the senses, mind, and intellect, misleading them and burying the understanding in delusion. 41 Fight with all your strength, Arjuna! Controlling your senses, conquer your enemy, the destroyer of knowledge and realization. 40  The senses are higher than the body, the mind higher than the senses; above the mind is the intellect, and above the intellect is the Atman. 43 Thus, knowing that which is supreme, let the Atman rule the ego. Use your mighty arms to slay the fierce enemy that is selfish desire. 42  \fChapter Four  Wisdom in Action Krishna is eager to grant Arjuna knowledge of the highest spiritual truths, or even a rare mystical vision; but Arjuna has been asking for Krishna to simply get him out of his present difficulties. Of course these difficulties are not minor – he is caught in a family tragedy that has developed into a vicious conflict. If he cannot extricate himself, he knows that he will have to take part in a catastrophic battle that no one wants. So when Krishna begins to tell Arjuna about the “secret teachings” he will be privileged to hear because he is Krishna’s favorite devotee and friend, it hardly registers in Arjuna’s consciousness. His reply is confused. “How could you have taught any secret wisdom to the sages of old?” he asks. At this point Krishna reminds Arjuna again of the process of rebirth. They have both been reborn many times, but naturally Arjuna does not remember his past lives because he has no access to this kind of knowledge. Krishna remembers his former births, but he is no ordinary being. He reveals that he has chosen to take on human birth many times for the welfare of the world. Whenever dharma, the law of life’s unity, declines, he wraps himself in his maya and takes on a finite form. Thus he returns age after age. Vishnu, the preserving or sustaining person of the Hindu Trinity, is not mentioned here, but Krishna is usually looked upon as an incarnation of this aspect of God. As the Lord, Krishna explains, he dwells in every being, but he is manifested with special power in his incarnations or avatars. Avatara literally means descent: Vishnu is believed to descend and incarnate himself on earth from age to age to reestablish divine law (dharma). Without such intervention the entire created universe would go into decline. The natural course of creation is to go through cycles of regeneration and decay, but Vishnu – Krishna – has compassion for all the suffering of the world, and comes himself to protect the good and destroy evil. Thus Vishnu has a special relationship with all beings: he personifies the aspect of God who so loves the world that he comes into it to reestablish the purity and happiness of the Golden Age.  \fKrishna here reveals a little of his hidden, divine nature. He tells Arjuna that mystical union with him is possible through devotion, by which one can enter the state of divine love in which one sees God in every creature. Krishna also takes on the role of creator. It is he who has patterned the world along the lines of guna and karma. This mystic aspect of Krishna’s being dominates the Gita. In the Mahabharata, Krishna is a princely ally who is wise and daring in his support of his friend Arjuna. But the author of the Gita is not concerned with this Krishna; he turns his attention to the mystery of Krishna’s divine nature as an aspect of Vishnu. In this sense Krishna is the inner Self in all beings. His name comes from the Sanskrit root krish, “to draw to oneself, to attract.” He is the “attractive one,” the “Lord of loving attraction.” By another etymology, the word Krishna means “the dark one.” The author of the Gita sees revealed in him the ultimate Godhead, the supreme being. But this reality is often veiled, and then Krishna is seen as an ordinary human being – or, rather, as an exceptionally gifted man, but not as God. Many of Krishna’s words make most sense when we realize that when he speaks of himself, he is often not describing a transcendental reality so much as trying to tell Arjuna about the Self in every human being. When he says, for example, “Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results,” he means, “Arjuna, actions do not cling to your real Self.” The Self in us is not touched by action; whatever we do, it remains unsullied. “Those who understand this” – about themselves – “and practice it live in freedom.” The latter part of this chapter turns from lofty mystical topics back to Arjuna’s immediate problem. Krishna begins to talk about action, and work, and things that should be done and should not be done. It is essential, he reminds Arjuna, to act wisely, with detachment. The wise never act with selfish attachment to the fruit of their labor; they give their best in fortune and misfortune alike. Such people act in freedom. The next section deals with the various kinds of yajna – worship or offering – that may be performed by spiritual aspirants of differing temperaments. Hindu rituals often involve making an offering to the gods by pouring an oblation into the sacred fire. Here the image is the same: whatever is offered is symbolically thrown into a consuming fire that carries the offering to God. The offering may be as obvious as worldly goods, or as subtle as knowledge or meditation: in any case it requires a  \fmeasure of self-sacrifice. Yajna is a basic action, necessary to life, and those who do not perform some kind of selfless service find no home in this world or the next. The final verses of chapter 4 introduce a new principle. In the last chapter, Krishna mentioned the path of spiritual wisdom as an alternative to the path of action or karma yoga. Now he reveals that wisdom is the goal of selfless action: knowing is the fruit of doing. The goal of all karma yoga or yajna is liberation and spiritual wisdom. The fire of spiritual awareness burns to ashes even a great heap of karma; thus true knowledge is the greatest purifier of the soul. Krishna ends by exhorting Arjuna to cut through the doubts that still stifle him. This is the first – but not the last – mention that Krishna makes of Arjuna’s doubting heart. There has been no indication so far that Arjuna has taken in and accepted Krishna’s words. But even though Arjuna continues to drag his feet, Krishna does not abandon him. –D.M.  \f4: Wisdom in Action KRISHNA  I told this eternal secret to Vivasvat. Vivasvat taught Manu, and Manu taught Ikshvaku. 2 Thus, Arjuna, eminent sages received knowledge of yoga in a continuous tradition. But through time the practice of yoga was lost in the world. 1  The secret of these teachings is profound. I have explained them to you today because you are my friend and devotee. 3  ARJUNA  You were born much after Vivasvat; he lived very long ago. Why do you say that you taught this yoga in the beginning? 4  KRISHNA  You and I have passed through many births, Arjuna. You have forgotten, but I remember them all. 5  My true being is unborn and changeless. I am the Lord who dwells in every creature. Through the power of my own maya, I manifest myself in a finite form. 6  Whenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I manifest myself on earth. 8 I am born in every age to protect the good, to destroy evil, and to reestablish dharma. 7  Those who know me as their own divine Self break through the belief that they are the body and are not reborn as separate creatures. Such a one, Arjuna, is united with me. 10 Delivered from selfish 9  \fattachment, fear, and anger, filled with me, surrendering themselves to me, purified in the fire of my being, many have reached the state of unity in me. As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. 11  Those desiring success in their actions worship the gods; through action in the world of mortals, their desires are quickly fulfilled. 13 The distinctions of caste, guna, and karma have come from me. I am their cause, but I myself am changeless and beyond all action. 14 Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results. Those who understand this and practice it live in freedom. 15 Knowing this truth, aspirants desiring liberation in ancient times engaged in action. You too can do the same, pursuing an active life in the manner of those ancient sages. 12  What is action and what is inaction? This question has confused the greatest sages. I will give you the secret of action, with which you can free yourself from bondage. 17 The true nature of action is difficult to grasp. You must understand what is action and what is inaction, and what kind of action should be avoided. 16  The wise see that there is action in the midst of inaction and inaction in the midst of action. Their consciousness is unified, and every act is done with complete awareness. 18  The awakened sages call a person wise when all his undertakings are free from anxiety about results; all his selfish desires have been consumed in the fire of knowledge. 20 The wise, ever satisfied, have abandoned all external supports. Their security is unaffected by the results of their action; even while acting, they really do nothing at all. 21 Free from expectations and from all sense of possession, with mind and body firmly controlled by the Self, they do not incur sin by the performance of physical action. 19  They live in freedom who have gone beyond the dualities of life. Competing with no one, they are alike in success and failure and 22  \fcontent with whatever comes to them. 23 They are free, without selfish attachments; their minds are fixed in knowledge. They perform all work in the spirit of service, and their karma is dissolved. The process of offering is Brahman; that which is offered is Brahman. Brahman offers the sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. Brahman is attained by those who see Brahman in every action. 24  Some aspirants offer material sacrifices to the gods. Others offer selfless service as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. 26 Some renounce all enjoyment of the senses, sacrificing them in the fire of sense restraint. Others partake of sense objects but offer them in service through the fire of the senses. 27 Some offer the workings of the senses and the vital forces through the fire of self-control, kindled in the path of knowledge. 25  Some offer wealth; others offer sense restraint and suffering. Some take vows and offer knowledge and study of the scriptures; and some make the offering of meditation. 29 Some offer the forces of vitality, regulating their inhalation and exhalation, and thus gain control over these forces. 30 Others offer the forces of vitality through restraint of their senses. All these understand the meaning of service and will be cleansed of their impurities. 28  True sustenance is in service, and through it a man or woman reaches the eternal Brahman. But those who do not seek to serve are without a home in this world. Arjuna, how can they be at home in any world to come? 31  These offerings are born of work, and each guides mankind along a path to Brahman. Understanding this, you will attain liberation. 33 The offering of wisdom is better than any material offering, Arjuna; for the goal of all work is spiritual wisdom. 32  Approach those who have realized the purpose of life and question them with reverence and devotion; they will instruct you in 34  \fthis wisdom. 35 Once you attain it, you will never again be deluded. You will see all creatures in the Self, and all in me. Even if you were the most sinful of sinners, Arjuna, you could cross beyond all sin by the raft of spiritual wisdom. 37 As the heat of a fire reduces wood to ashes, the fire of knowledge burns to ashes all karma. 38 Nothing in this world purifies like spiritual wisdom. It is the perfection achieved in time through the path of yoga, the path which leads to the Self within. 36  Those who take wisdom as their highest goal, whose faith is deep and whose senses are trained, attain wisdom quickly and enter into perfect peace. 40 But the ignorant, indecisive and lacking in faith, waste their lives. They can never be happy in this world or any other. 39  Those established in the Self have renounced selfish attachments to their actions and cut through doubts with spiritual wisdom. They act in freedom. 42 Arjuna, cut through this doubt in your own heart with the sword of spiritual wisdom. Arise; take up the path of yoga! 41  \fChapter Five  Renounce & Rejoice At the beginning of this chapter, the traditional approach to the spiritual life – that is, “leaving the world,” retiring from the ordinary affairs of job and family – is contrasted with working in the world with detachment. The general term for retiring from the world is sannyasa, “renunciation.” Traditionally, sannyasa meant renouncing all worldly ties and attachments. The person undertaking the vow of sannyasa would leave home, family, and occupation to pursue a strict contemplative life. This was a path chosen by very few, even in ancient India. Yet we shouldn’t forget that surprising numbers of people in traditional societies, both in the East and the West, have chosen a monastic life removed from the turmoil of the world. In India, the Compassionate Buddha provides the classic example of one who leaves the comforts and fulfillments of family and worldly life to seek the lonely way to Self-realization. The story is well known throughout Asia. Siddhartha Gautama was a prince with every worldly satisfaction within his reach, who left his palace to find a way to lead the world beyond suffering and death. He became a wandering sannyasi, a lonely, austere monk. Only after he had attained to complete enlightenment did he return to society, to teach others of the peace of nirvana. Though Krishna acknowledges here that this way of sannyasa can lead to the goal, he recommends the path of selfless action or selfless service as the better way. He contrasts the way of Sankhya – which in this context means knowledge of the Self in a general way – to the way of yoga, which here means the way of action. This term yoga presents difficulties in the Gita because it means different things at different times, and many definitions are given of this all-purpose term. But for several chapters the topic under discussion has been the active spiritual life, or karma yoga, and that is clearly what is meant in this context. Sankhya and yoga might also be translated as “theory and practice.” It would seem that at the time of the Gita the path of wisdom was regarded very highly, while the path of action may have been looked upon as an adulteration of the spiritual life. It is even possible that the Gita was  \fthe first Hindu scripture to introduce the novel idea of combining karma yoga with the pursuit of Self-knowledge. Krishna says that only immature, inexperienced people look upon the paths of knowledge and action as different. The true goal of action is knowledge of the Self. Following either path faithfully will lead to the complete spiritual vision. It is essential in karma yoga that the selfish ego not expect gratification from the work. When there is no selfish involvement in work, the worker does not come to spiritual harm. The example is the lotus: it spends its life floating in water, yet the drops of water roll off its leaves without ever wetting them. Similarly, as long as the karma yogis do not expect reward or recognition, any evil that might stain them has nowhere to cling. Such yogis are said to be detached from the outcome or fruits of their actions (karma phala). Krishna warns Arjuna that a life of work, even successful work, cannot be fulfilling without Self-knowledge. Ultimately, the true Self within him is not affected by what he does, whether good or bad. Only knowledge of the Self, which rises like the sun at dawn, can fulfill the purpose of his life and lead him beyond rebirth. This knowledge of the Self or Atman is, by its very nature, also knowledge of Brahman, the all-pervading, immanent and transcendent Godhead. Krishna says that the illumined person sees this divine essence in all beings. He or she has “equal vision” and sees the divine Self in all, regardless of the outer aspect. The last three verses of the chapter describe a state of profound meditation called samadhi. When meditation becomes very deep, breathing becomes slow, steady, and even, and the windows of the senses close to all outward sensations. Next the faculties of the mind quiet down, resting from their usually frantic activity; even the primal emotions of desire, fear, and anger subside. When all these sensory and emotional tides have ceased to flow, then the spirit is free, mukta – at least for the time being. It has entered the state called samadhi. Samadhi can come and go; generally it can be entered only in a long period of meditation and after many years of ardent endeavor. But one verse (5:28) adds the significant word sada, “always.” Once this state of deep concentration becomes established, the person lives in spiritual freedom, or moksha, permanently. This is extremely rare. Mystics of the West as well as the East have attained brief glimpses of unity, but very few can be said to  \fhave dwelt in it permanently, as if it were their natural habitat. In the West the most prominent figures are Meister Eckhart, St. Teresa of Avila, and St. John of the Cross, though there have been others. In the Hindu tradition there is a long line of saints and mystics who have tried to communicate something of the nature of this union with Reality or God, from the unknown recorders of the Upanishads through the Buddha, Shankara, and Meera, to Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi. –D.M.  \f5: Renounce & Rejoice ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have recommended both the path of selfless action and sannyasa, the path of renunciation of action. Tell me definitely which is better. 1  KRISHNA  Both renunciation of action and the selfless performance of action lead to the supreme goal. But the path of action is better than renunciation. 2  Those who have attained perfect renunciation are free from any sense of duality; they are unaffected by likes and dislikes, Arjuna, and are free from the bondage of self-will. 4 The immature think that knowledge and action are different, but the wise see them as the same. The person who is established in one path will attain the rewards of both. 5 The goal of knowledge and the goal of service are the same; those who fail to see this are blind. 3  Perfect renunciation is difficult to attain without performing action. But the wise, following the path of selfless service, quickly reach Brahman. 6  Those who follow the path of service, who have completely purified themselves and conquered their senses and self-will, see the Self in all creatures and are untouched by any action they perform. 7  Those who know this truth, whose consciousness is unified, think always, “I am not the doer.” While seeing or hearing, touching or 8  \fsmelling; eating, moving about, or sleeping; breathing 9 or speaking, letting go or holding on, even opening or closing the eyes, they understand that these are only the movements of the senses among sense objects. Those who surrender to Brahman all selfish attachments are like the leaf of a lotus floating clean and dry in water. Sin cannot touch them. 11 Renouncing their selfish attachments, those who follow the path of service work with body, senses, and mind for the sake of self-purification. 10  Those whose consciousness is unified abandon all attachment to the results of action and attain supreme peace. But those whose desires are fragmented, who are selfishly attached to the results of their work, are bound in everything they do. 12  Those who renounce attachment in all their deeds live content in the “city of nine gates,” the body, as its master. They are not driven to act, nor do they involve others in action. 13  Neither the sense of acting, nor actions, nor the connection of cause and effect comes from the Lord of this world. These three arise from nature. 14  The Lord does not partake in the good and evil deeds of any person; judgment is clouded when wisdom is obscured by ignorance. 16 But ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self within. The light of this knowledge shines like the sun, revealing the supreme Brahman. 17 Those who cast off sin through this knowledge, absorbed in the Lord and established in him as their one goal and refuge, are not reborn as separate creatures. 15  Those who possess this wisdom have equal regard for all. They see the same Self in a spiritual aspirant and an outcaste, in an elephant, a cow, and a dog. 19 Such people have mastered life. With even mind they rest in Brahman, who is perfect and is everywhere the same. 20 They are not elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. With mind established in Brahman, they are free from delusion. 18  \fNot dependent on any external support, they realize the joy of spiritual awareness. With consciousness unified through meditation, they live in abiding joy. 21  Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses have a beginning and an end and give birth to misery, Arjuna. The wise do not look for happiness in them. 23 But those who overcome the impulses of lust and anger which arise in the body are made whole and live in joy. 24 They find their joy, their rest, and their light completely within themselves. United with the Lord, they attain nirvana in Brahman. 22  Healed of their sins and conflicts, working for the good of all beings, the holy sages attain nirvana in Brahman. 26 Free from anger and selfish desire, unified in mind, those who follow the path of yoga and realize the Self are established forever in that supreme state. 25  Closing their eyes, steadying their breathing, and focusing their attention on the center of spiritual consciousness, 28 the wise master their senses, mind, and intellect through meditation. Self-realization is their only goal. Freed from selfish desire, fear, and anger, they live in freedom always. 29 Knowing me as the friend of all creatures, the Lord of the universe, the end of all offerings and all spiritual disciplines, they attain eternal peace. 27  \fChapter Six  The Practice of Meditation This is surely one of the most intriguing chapters of the Gita, for here we are given a detailed explanation of meditation addressed to the layperson. The same meditation techniques are given in more esoteric writings, such as the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, but the Gita does it more simply, without any unnecessary mystery or complexity. This chapter also explores the question, “Who is the true yogi?” This word yogi, if it has any associations for the Western reader, is likely to bring up images of rather far-out types who do strange contortions with their bodies. Yogis are still thought of as standing on their heads or reclining on a bed of nails. It is true that there are many practitioners of a kind of yoga that involves physical exercises and postures; and there are those who have achieved remarkable feats like lying on beds of nails, or even being buried alive and surviving. But this physical side of yoga (called hatha yoga, “the yoga of force”) is not what is meant in the Gita. In fact, though physical techniques have a place, the Gita regards undue emphasis on them as extreme, not belonging to the normal course of spiritual development. In the Gita, the word yogi often has a more modest definition: it can mean a person who does his or her job with detachment from the rewards (6:1), or it can be rendered as “one who has attained the goal of meditation.” For yogi literally means “one who is accomplished in yoga,” and yoga means “integration of the spirit.” In this sense, yoga means wholeness or the process of becoming whole at the deepest spiritual level. The word yoga is also often used as a synonym for raja yoga, the practice of meditation as taught by Patanjali; for meditation is the direct means of becoming integrated, united with one’s truest, deepest Self. Thus a yogi, among other things, is a person who is an adept at meditation. Until now, Krishna has been instructing Arjuna in the need for karma yoga, the active life of service. Now he is ready to initiate his disciple into the practice of the more interior disciplines of the spiritual life. Karma yoga, he says, is the path for those who wish to climb the mountain of Selfrealization; for those who have reached the summit, the path is shama, the peace of contemplation. At the beginning of the spiritual life, great exertion  \fis required; as the summit is approached, though the climb gets no easier, the dimension of contemplation or stillness is added. Many spiritual traditions, of course, use this image when speaking of the religious quest. The mountaintop is the place where the holy, like Moses, commune with God; and St. John of the Cross describes the path to union with God as climbing the mountain of Carmel. In climbing this mountain, willpower, self-help, intense personal effort, are absolute essentials. The literal translation of verse 5 is “one should lift oneself up by one’s Self” – a play on the word atman, which can mean the highest Self as well as self in the ordinary sense. One’s self is thus one’s friend or one’s own enemy. The “lower self,” as Western mystics sometimes call it, is self-will – will in the negative, selfish sense. An unruly will twisted toward self-aggrandizement is an enemy lurking right inside the fort, where it can do the most damage. But those who “have conquered themselves by themselves” have their truest friend in the Self. Only those who have genuine self-discipline, who are “self-conquered,” live in peace. These, Krishna says, are true yogis. They cannot harbor any malice, cannot even bring themselves to look upon anyone as an enemy. They are samabuddhi, “of equable mind.” The true yogi, the person who is truly integrated inside, looks upon and feels everyone else’s joy and sorrow just as if it were his own. He sees the Self in all beings, everywhere. How is this self-conquest to be made? Very simply, the Gita teaches that the mind must be made one-pointed through the practice of meditation. This is the basic technique. In the Gita we do not see the tendency for elaboration, for ritual and mystery, that we sometimes find in the Hindu tradition. Krishna simply tells Arjuna, first, that he must find an appropriate place to meditate. A suitable spot for his practice will be clean and comfortable. In a nod to tradition, one verse recommends the meditation seat be covered with kusha grass and a deer skin – the traditional seat of the yogi. The important thing, however, is not how the meditation cushion is constructed, but what is going on in the mind. Meditation is an internal discipline to make the mind one-pointed, absolutely concentrated. Second, Krishna offers a bit of advice about holding the body, head, and neck in a straight line. This may seem esoteric – a reference to the contortion-school of yoga – but actually it has a practical purpose. Sitting absolutely straight, with the spinal column erect, prevents drowsiness. Also,  \fin advanced stages of meditation, it allows for the free flow of vital energy or kundalini (see Glossary). Then practical advice is given: moderation is the path. Neither extreme asceticism nor indulgence will aid meditation. A superficial acquaintance with Hindu culture may leave the impression that it fosters either the sensuality of the Kama Sutra or the asceticism of the hermit. It is true that in Indian civilization we can easily see the ultimate development of the sensual and beautiful life in its finest manifestation, in painting, sculpture, music, and dance. And Indian cuisine is famous for its incredible variety of flavors and spices. India also presents us with the austere simplicity of the wandering holy man or sadhu. The Gita, however, recommends the middle path. Success in meditation, Krishna says, comes neither to those who eat or sleep too much nor to those who eat or sleep too little. The body should be neither overindulged nor treated harshly – the same recommendation the Buddha was to offer later, after many years of severe asceticism. This chapter contains the famous verse (6:19) comparing the mind to a steady flame. By its very nature the untrained mind is restless, constantly wandering here and there in trying to fulfil its desires. It flickers wildly like a flame in a storm – never blown completely out, yet at the mercy of the wind. Wherever it wanders, Krishna says, it must be brought back to its source; it must learn to rest in the Self. Once it is at home in the depths of contemplation, the mind becomes steady, like an upright, unflickering flame in a windless place. In this deep meditation, and only there, can the human being find true fulfillment. Then “the still mind touches Brahman and enjoys bliss.” Now Arjuna asks the inevitable question. Krishna is way ahead of him, and the struggling disciple calls out, “Wait a minute!” or words to that effect. He says, “My mind is so restless and unsteady that I cannot even comprehend anything about this state of mystic peace you are talking about.” The mind is so powerful, so turbulent, that trying to bring it under control is like trying to catch the wind. Krishna admits that the mind is terribly hard to train, but he maintains that it can be done through regular practice if one has detachment. It is interesting that he does not offer to help Arjuna here; that will come later. For now, he tells Arjuna that he must do it for himself, through hard work and detachment from private, personal motives.  \fThen Arjuna asks a rather surprising question: what happens to the person who believes in a spiritual goal but does not pursue it to the end? What if one of his more powerful compulsive desires gets the better of him, scattering his resolution the way a cloud is scattered by the wind? Arjuna must be at least partly convinced that there is something to all this, but either he is not ready to begin meditating or he is afraid that somehow he might fail if he tried. If he were to fail, he asks, would he have lost everything – all that he had given up in worldly life as well as his goal of self-fulfillment? Affectionately, Krishna assures Arjuna that no attempt to improve his spiritual condition could possibly be a wasted effort. Even looking ahead to the next life, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. He will be reborn in a household suitable for taking up his quest where he left off. In his next life, he will feel drawn to the spiritual goal once again, and he will have a head start. The general Hindu belief is that Self-realization requires many, many lives of spiritual discipline. –D.M.  \f6: Practice of Meditation KRISHNA  It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those who work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of meditation. Theirs is true renunciation. 2 Therefore, Arjuna, you should understand that renunciation and the performance of selfless service are the same. Those who cannot renounce attachment to the results of their work are far from the path. 1  For aspirants who want to climb the mountain of spiritual awareness, the path is selfless work; for those who have ascended to yoga the path is stillness and peace. 4 When a person has freed himself from attachment to the results of work, and from desires for the enjoyment of sense objects, he ascends to the unitive state. 3  Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. 5  To those who have conquered themselves, the will is a friend. But it is the enemy of those who have not found the Self within them. 6  The supreme Reality stands revealed in the consciousness of those who have conquered themselves. They live in peace, alike in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. 7  They are completely fulfilled by spiritual wisdom and Selfrealization. Having conquered their senses, they have climbed to the summit of human consciousness. To such people a clod of dirt, a stone, and gold are the same. 9 They are equally disposed to family, 8  \fenemies, and friends, to those who support them and those who are hostile, to the good and the evil alike. Because they are impartial, they rise to great heights. Those who aspire to the state of yoga should seek the Self in inner solitude through meditation. With body and mind controlled they should constantly practice one-pointedness, free from expectations and attachment to material possessions. 10  Select a clean spot, neither too high nor too low, and seat yourself firmly on a cloth, a deerskin, and kusha grass. 12 Then, once seated, strive to still your thoughts. Make your mind one-pointed in meditation, and your heart will be purified. 13 Hold your body, head, and neck firmly in a straight line, and keep your eyes from wandering. 14 With all fears dissolved in the peace of the Self and all desires dedicated to Brahman, controlling the mind and fixing it on me, sit in meditation with me as your only goal. 15 With senses and mind constantly controlled through meditation, united with the Self within, an aspirant attains nirvana, the state of abiding joy and peace in me. 11  Arjuna, those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too much or sleep too little, will not succeed in meditation. 17 But those who are temperate in eating and sleeping, work and recreation, will come to the end of sorrow through meditation. 18 Through constant effort they learn to withdraw the mind from selfish cravings and absorb it in the Self. Thus they attain the state of union. 16  When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp in a windless place. 20 In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. 21 Having attained that abiding joy beyond the senses, revealed in the stilled mind, he never swerves from the eternal truth. 22 He desires nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow. 19  \fThe practice of meditation frees one from all affliction. This is the path of yoga. Follow it with determination and sustained enthusiasm. 24 Renouncing wholeheartedly all selfish desires and expectations, use your will to control the senses. 25 Little by little, through patience and repeated effort, the mind will become stilled in the Self. 23  Wherever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for satisfaction without, lead it within; train it to rest in the Self 27 Abiding joy comes to those who still the mind. Freeing themselves from the taint of self-will, with their consciousness unified, they become one with Brahman. 26  The infinite joy of touching Brahman is easily attained by those who are free from the burden of evil and established within themselves. 29 They see the Self in every creature and all creation in the Self. With consciousness unified through meditation, they see everything with an equal eye. 28  I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me. 31 They worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. 30  When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. 32  ARJUNA  O Krishna, the stillness of divine union which you describe is beyond my comprehension. How can the mind, which is so restless, attain lasting peace? 34 Krishna, the mind is restless, turbulent, powerful, violent; trying to control it is like trying to tame the wind. 33  KRISHNA  \fIt is true that the mind is restless and difficult to control. But it can be conquered, Arjuna, through regular practice and detachment. 36 Those who lack self-control will find it difficult to progress in meditation; but those who are self-controlled, striving earnestly through the right means, will attain the goal. 35  ARJUNA  Krishna, what happens to the man who has faith but who lacks self-control and wanders from the path, not attaining success in yoga? 38 If a man becomes deluded on the spiritual path, will he lose the support of both worlds, like a cloud scattered in the sky? 39 Krishna, you can dispel all doubts; remove this doubt which binds me. 37  KRISHNA  Arjuna, my son, such a person will not be destroyed. No one who does good work will ever come to a bad end, either here or in the world to come. 40  When such people die, they go to other realms where the righteous live. They dwell there for countless years and then are reborn into a home which is pure and prosperous. 42 Or they may be born into a family where meditation is practiced; to be born into such a family is extremely rare. 43 The wisdom they have acquired in previous lives will be reawakened, Arjuna, and they will strive even harder for Self-realization. 44 Indeed, they will be driven on by the strength of their past disciplines. Even one who inquires after the practice of meditation rises above those who simply perform rituals. 41  Through constant effort over many lifetimes, a person becomes purified of all selfish desires and attains the supreme goal of life. 45  Meditation is superior to severe asceticism and the path of knowledge. It is also superior to selfless service. May you attain the goal of meditation, Arjuna! 47 Even among those who meditate, that 46  \fman or woman who worships me with perfect faith, completely absorbed in me, is the most firmly established in yoga.  \fChapter Seven  Wisdom from Realization In Sanskrit this chapter is called “The Yoga of Wisdom and Realization” – or “The Yoga of Wisdom from Realization.” The term used for wisdom is jnana; for realization, vijnana. There is room for confusion in this terminology, as jnana and vijnana are open to differing interpretations. Both words are from the root jna, “to know,” which is related to the Greek word gnosis. The prefix vi added to a noun usually intensifies its meaning; so vijnana could mean to know intensely or to a greater degree. In this context, however, jnana is the standard term for the highest kind of knowledge: not scholarship or book-learning but direct knowledge of God, spiritual wisdom. If we take jnana in this sense, we are not left with an obvious meaning for vijnana, a “more intense kind of jnana.” Ramakrishna takes vijnana to mean an intimate, practical familiarity with God, the ability to carry through in daily affairs with the more abstract understanding that is jnana. Ramakrishna says, “One who has merely heard of fire has ajnana, ignorance. One who has seen fire has jnana. But one who has actually built a fire and cooked on it has vijnana.” In this chapter we find ourselves following several trails and sometimes lose the unifying theme, which is knowledge of the supreme reality underlying nature. Eventually, however, we come back to the starting point: knowledge contrasted with ignorance, transcendent reality as opposed to the phenomenal world. But to pursue the byways. First, Krishna’s “two natures” are discussed. On the one hand, he has created out of himself the elements and all things that make up the phenomenal world. Beyond this is Krishna’s spiritual nature as the transcendent Lord of the universe. Here the Gita is referring to a concept that later became a basis of the Sankhya school of Hindu philosophy. Sankhya recognized two fundamental principles underlying all things: prakriti, the principle of mind and matter, and Purusha, the principle of pure spirit. The union of these two eternal, fundamental forces sets in motion the creation of the world as we know it. Their union also shapes and defines all ordinary human experience. In Sankhya, the goal of Self-  \frealization is seen as the final freeing of the spirit (Purusha) from its flirtation with mind and matter (prakriti). Unlike Sankhya, however, in the Gita it is Krishna who is behind both prakriti and Purusha. In this chapter, Krishna is presented as the Creator of the world. His divine nature can be glimpsed in his bewildering and wonderful creation. In much Hindu mythology, it is the god Brahma who takes credit for creating the world. It is he, the four-faced deity, who has flung forth the manifold worlds of this and former (as well as future) universes. But in the mythology of Vishnu, Brahma is born in the lotus that grows from Vishnu’s navel. The lotus is Vishnu’s womb. In it Brahma is born, and at Vishnu’s urging he creates the worlds. Vishnu is the real Creator; Brahma is a demigod born of Vishnu’s will to create. Here in the Gita Krishna directly assumes all the roles and honors usually shared with the other aspects of God worshipped in the Hindu faith. It is not that these other divine personifications are rejected, but simply that all attention is on Krishna. For the author of the Gita, Krishna is the form of God to be worshipped, and for the time being all other forms of God disappear. Krishna alone is. In fact, one verse states that whatever other god one seems to worship, one is in reality approaching Krishna himself. Worshipping him, knowing him, enables the devotee to attain the goal. Though the word is not used in the Gita, the idea of the world as Krishna’s lila, his play, became a cherished theme of later Hinduism. Krishna, it is said, created the world in play: just as a child might desire to have companions to play with, Krishna desired companions, and made the world. Krishna participates in the game of life; his divine qualities shine through in the world wherever there is excellence of any kind. He is, he tells Arjuna, the essence of every created thing: the sapidity of water, the brightness of fire, the effort of the spiritual aspirant. This may be what is meant by the vijnana of our title – the mystic’s vision of the divine as present here and now is perhaps the real meaning of the term. The word maya appears here, though not for the first time in the Gita. Just as the concepts of prakriti and Purusha are later developed in Sankhya philosophy, maya is later built into the formal structure of Vedanta, another of the six major schools of Indian philosophy. The word maya comes from the root ma, “to measure out,” and originally meant the power of a deity to create, especially to create what Indian philosophy calls “name and form”: matter and its percepts. Maya was the magical capacity to create form and  \fillusion – a god’s divine power to put on a disguise, or to fling forth world after world of life. Maya is also the outward look of things, the passing show that conceals immortal being. Maya can be both delightful and dangerous, alluring and yet treacherous. The gunas, the three basic qualities of all created things, swirl within the world of maya. Crossing over the ocean of maya is the goal of the wise voyager, and one boat is devotion. In this chapter the Gita begins to stress the importance of love and devotion – themes that later become dominant. Krishna’s true nature is hidden by maya (7:25). The dangers of maya are not depicted strongly in this chapter, but the “delusions” – moha – of life in maya’s world are hinted at; they are, essentially, the self-centered attachments Krishna has been warning against. Moha, which means confusion or delusion, is something like dreaming while awake, “living in a dream.” The duality of attachment and aversion (love and hate) beguiles the mind into this moha-swoon right at birth (7:27). Knowing Krishna, and devotion to him, is the way beyond this delusion. Thus chapter 7 contrasts wisdom (jnana and vijnana) with the delusion (moha) of spiritual ignorance. We find here many seminal ideas that are elaborated in the later philosophies of Sankhya and Vedanta. These concepts of prakriti, Purusha, and maya do not originate with the Gita, however. The word maya appears in the Rig Veda, the most ancient of the Vedas, and Purusha is a recurring theme in the Upanishads. The Gita is a halfway point between the spontaneous insights of the Upanishads and the later, highly formalized philosophical systems. In the Gita we find an organized presentation of these and other key concepts without a cumbersome technical explanation. – D.M.  \f7: Wisdom from Realization KRISHNA  With your mind intent on me, Arjuna, discipline yourself with the practice of yoga. Depend on me completely. Listen, and I will dispel all your doubts; you will come to know me fully and be united with me. 1  I will give you both jnana and vijnana. When both these are realized, there is nothing more you need to know. 2  One person in many thousands may seek perfection, yet of these only a few reach the goal and come to realize me. 4 Earth, water, fire, air, akasha, mind, intellect, and ego – these are the eight divisions of my prakriti. 5 But beyond this I have another, higher nature, Arjuna; it supports the whole universe and is the source of life in all beings. 3  In these two aspects of my nature is the womb of all creation. The birth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. 7 There is nothing that exists separate from me, Arjuna. The entire universe is suspended from me as my necklace of jewels. 6  Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings. 9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant. 8  My eternal seed, Arjuna, is to be found in every creature. I am the power of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory 10  \fof the noble. 11 In those who are strong, I am strength, free from passion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life. The states of sattva, rajas, and tamas come from me, but I am not in them. 13 These three gunas deceive the world: people fail to look beyond them to me, supreme and imperishable. 14 The three gunas make up my divine maya, difficult to overcome. But they cross over this maya who take refuge in me. 15 Others are deluded by maya; performing evil deeds, they have no devotion to me. Having lost all discrimination, they follow the way of their lower nature. 12  Good people come to worship me for different reasons. Some come to the spiritual life because of suffering, some in order to understand life; some come through a desire to achieve life’s purpose, and some come who are men and women of wisdom. 17 Unwavering in devotion, always united with me, the man or woman of wisdom surpasses all the others. To them I am the dearest beloved, and they are very dear to me. 18 All those who follow the spiritual path are blessed. But the wise who are always established in union, for whom there is no higher goal than me, may be regarded as my very Self. 16  After many births the wise seek refuge in me, seeing me everywhere and in everything. Such great souls are very rare. 20 There are others whose discrimination is misled by many desires. Following their own nature, they worship lower gods, practicing various rites. 19  When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that. 22 Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. 23 Those whose understanding is small attain only transient satisfaction: those who worship the gods go to the gods. But my devotees come to me. 21  Through lack of understanding, people believe that I, the Unmanifest, have entered into some form. They fail to realize my 24  \ftrue nature, which transcends birth and death. 25 Few see through the veil of maya. The world, deluded, does not know that I am without birth and changeless. 26 I know everything about the past, the present, and the future, Arjuna; but there is no one who knows me completely. Delusion arises from the duality of attraction and aversion, Arjuna; every creature is deluded by these from birth. 28 But those who have freed themselves from all wrongdoing are firmly established in worship of me. Their actions are pure, and they are free from the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites. 27  Those who take refuge in me, striving for liberation from old age and death, come to know Brahman, the Self, and the nature of all action. 30 Those who see me ruling the cosmos, who see me in the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva, and the adhiyajna, are conscious of me even at the time of death. 29  \fChapter Eight  Eternal Godhead This chapter alludes briefly to several important concepts presented more fully in the Upanishads, and it will be helpful to quote the Upanishads to elucidate these points. Also, this chapter presents a very ancient view of the soul’s journey after death. These ideas about the afterlife did not originate in the Gita, and are even more ancient than the Upanishads. Another ancient concept here is that of a cyclical universe, which is elaborated in other Hindu scriptures in great detail; this chapter merely refers to it in passing. The chapter begins with Arjuna asking what appear to be questions of theology, but the role of theologian does not fit him naturally. These questions are asked in response to the technical terms mentioned in the last verse of chapter 7. The sense of Krishna’s answer is in accord with what he said earlier about his maya: he is God immanent in all things as well as God transcendent. But it is Arjuna’s other question that determines the direction the discourse now takes. Arjuna asks how Krishna can be known at the hour of death. Here, of course, Arjuna means Krishna in his cosmic, mystical aspect, so he is asking in essence, “How can the Self-realized person enter the supreme state of immortality at the time of death?” Krishna replies that whoever remembers him at the time of death will enter madbhavam, “my being.” If Arjuna can remember Krishna in the hour of death, he will be united with Krishna and enter into immortality. In fact, whatever it may be, the content of the mind at the hour of death directs the soul in its journey to rebirth. Thus the mind influences the evolution of the soul as it moves into the next life. Whatever a person thinks about in life – his or her deepest motivations – are likely to be the last thoughts at the time of death. So there is a continuity between this life and the next, and all the baggage of desire and motivation goes right along with the soul. But here Krishna is talking about the person – he hopes Arjuna will be such a one – who has no worldly baggage, who will remember Krishna at the final hour. To ensure he will focus his devotion on Krishna at the hour of death, Arjuna should make a practice of remembering him continually now. If he  \fmakes his mind one-pointed in meditation and learns to focus his being on Krishna, then naturally at the time of death he will think of nothing else. Otherwise, in the chaos of death, he will panic and lose his way. Krishna describes in detail what happens to consciousness at the moment of death (8:12–13). These verses actually describe the yogis as being in control of the process of death. Directing their consciousness step by step through the difficult ordeal of leaving the body, they attain the supreme goal. This idea is also accepted by one of the greatest teachers of meditation in ancient India, Patanjali, who says in the Yoga Sutras that the yogi dies at will. Similar descriptions of the death process occur in the Upanishads, though there the dying person is not necessarily in control. The Upanishads give a detailed account: When the Self seems to become weak and sink into unconsciousness, the vital breaths gather to him. Then he takes with him those particles of light and descends into the heart. When the consciousness that is in the eye turns back, the dying person no longer sees any form. “He is becoming one,” they say; “he does not see.” “He is becoming one,” they say; “he does not smell.” “He is becoming one,” they say; “he does not taste.” “He is becoming one,” they say; “he does not speak.” “He is becoming one,” they say; “he does not hear.” “He is becoming one,” they say; “he does not think or touch or know.” The point of his heart lights up, and by that light the Self departs, either through the eye, or the skull, or through some other door of the body. And when he departs, life departs: and when life departs, all other vital forces depart after it. He is conscious, and with consciousness he leaves the body. Then his knowledge and his works and his previous impressions go along with him. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad iv.4.1–2) First consciousness is withdrawn from the senses. The dying no longer hear or see what is going on around them. They are still conscious, but the “light” of consciousness has been withdrawn from the senses, here called the “gates” of the body. There are said to be nine such gates: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, the mouth, and the organs of generation and excretion. Sometimes two more are added: the navel and the sagittal suture, located at the top of the skull and called in Sanskrit brahmarandhra, “the aperture of Brahman.”  \fWhen consciousness has been withdrawn from these gates, Krishna says, “the mind is placed [“locked up”] in the heart.” (8:12) Here, as in Christian mysticism, it is the heart and not the head that is taken to be the home of the soul. Probably what is meant is the heart chakra, the center of consciousness corresponding to the center of the chest. Prana (vital energy) and awareness have been withdrawn from the outer frontiers of personality and consolidated within. At this stage of the death process an ordinary person has no access to the will; but it is just here that prana, with conscious awareness, must be made to move upwards to the head. If prana leaves the body through the brahmarandhra, there will be no rebirth: that is, the dying person will enter samadhi at the time of death. In samadhi, prana is withdrawn from lower levels of awareness to rush upwards to the seventh center at the crown of the head. This is possible only for the yogi who has thoroughly mastered meditation and the control of prana. If prana exits through some other one of the eleven doors of the body, the Upanishads say, the state of immortality will not be gained: When he departs from this body, he ascends with the rays of the sun, repeating the syllable Om. As soon as he thinks of it, he comes to the sun. That, indeed, is the door to the next world. Those who know enter; those who do not know are stopped. There is a verse: A hundred and one subtle tracks lead from the heart; One of these goes upwards to the crown of the head. Going up by it, he goes to eternal life. Others depart in various directions. (Chandogya Upanishad viii.6.5–6) In the Gita, as well as in this passage from the Chandogya Upanishad, the mantram Om is used. If the yogis can remember the mantram even as consciousness itself is departing the body – and, the Gita adds, if they can meditate on Krishna – they will go to the “highest goal.” Relinquishing the body in a state of samadhi, they attain the mystic eternity that is union with Krishna. In this chapter the Gita alludes to the two paths, “northern” and “southern,” that the soul may take after death. Verses 24–25 present in  \fabbreviated form what the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad spells out in obscure detail: Those who know this, who meditate upon Truth with faith while living in the forest, go to the light, from light to day, from day to the fortnight of the moon’s waxing, from the waxing fortnight to the six months of the sun’s northern journey, from those six months to the world of the devas, from the world of the devas to the sun, from the sun to the lightning. Then a spirit approaches them and leads them to the world of Brahman. In that world they live for eternal ages. They do not return again. But those who conquer worlds through sacrifice, charity, and austerity pass into the smoke, from the smoke into the night, from the night into the fortnight of the waning moon, from the fortnight of the waning moon into the six months of the sun’s southern journey, from there into the world of the ancestors, from the world of the ancestors into the moon, . . . and from there to rebirth. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad vi.2.15–16) “Northern and southern paths” refers to the path of the sun, which seems to move northward after the winter solstice and southward after the summer solstice. To die during the period in which the sun is moving southward was considered inauspicious; dying during the period after the winter solstice, when the sun is moving back north, meant the soul might take the northern path which leads to immortality. In the Gita and the Upanishads, this “northern path” has come to signify that the soul has been released from karma and need not be reborn. The southern path, by contrast, leads the soul to a new birth in this world, a birth suitable to its karma. This view of the soul’s journey after death has a primordial quality about it, giving the feeling that it far predates even the Upanishads. Perhaps it is a belief of very ancient times that found its way into the Upanishads, which say that the spiritually ready soul makes the journey of the northern route while those who have only practiced rituals take the southern. This chapter also briefly alludes to the Days and Nights of Brahma. Brahma is the Creator of the Hindu trinity, who brings forth the cosmos at the will of Vishnu. But Brahma in a sense is not in control of this creative  \fprocess. Just as day follows night in eternal, unvarying rhythm, so does the entire universe undergo cycles of creation, death, and new birth. As the Day of Brahma dawns, the cosmos comes into being; as the Day comes to an end, the entire creation dies and ceases to exist. Then, for a Night as long as the cosmic Day, the universe rests. It ceases to be – or, rather, it continues only in a subtle, unmanifest form, a dream in the mind of Vishnu, who lies sleeping on the waves of the cosmic ocean. Then, without deviating from the eternal rhythm, the cosmos is reborn when the Night is over. The new universe dawns, and Brahma once again moves into his active, creative Day. Scholars have noted that this grand vision of the cosmos being born, dying, and being reborn for eternity – cosmos after cosmos arising from the black immensity of nothingness – is quite similar to modern theories of the expanding and contracting universe put forward by contemporary cosmology. The vast time spans accepted by present-day physics are also similar to the cosmic Days and Nights of Brahma. Each Day lasts for a thousand yugas, which equals 4,320,000,000 years. For this near-eternity of time the universe lives and grows; then it dies and lies dormant for an equal time, before the new Day dawns. There is a state of being, however, that is higher than the perishable cosmos, which is not born and does not die the cosmic death. Here (8:20) it is called simply avyakta, the Unmanifest. This is the supreme goal of all living things, and it is Krishna’s home (8:21). Returning to this final resting place, the soul enters into immortal bliss and is not reborn. –D.M.  \f8: Eternal Godhead ARJUNA  O Krishna, what is Brahman, and what is the nature of action? What is the adhyatma, the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva? 2 What is the adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, and how is it to be offered? How are the self-controlled united with you at the time of death? 1  KRISHNA  My highest nature, the imperishable Brahman, gives every creature its existence and lives in every creature as the adhyatma. My action is creation and the bringing forth of creatures. 4 The adhibhuta is the perishable body; the adhidaiva is Purusha, eternal spirit. The adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, is made to me as the Lord within you. 3  Those who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do not doubt this. 6 Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death determines the destination of the dying; always they will tend toward that state of being. 7 Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. 8 When you make your mind one-pointed through regular practice of meditation, you will find the supreme glory of the Lord. 5  The Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler, subtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable, bright as the sun, beyond darkness. 10 Remembering him in this way at the time of death, through devotion and the power of meditation, with your mind completely stilled and your concentration fixed in 9  \fthe center of spiritual awareness between the eyebrows, you will realize the supreme Lord. I will tell you briefly of the eternal state all scriptures affirm, which can be entered only by those who are self-controlled and free from selfish passions. Those whose lives are dedicated to Brahman attain this supreme goal. 11  Remembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of the senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in meditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. 13 Repeating in this state the divine name, the syllable Om that represents the changeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the supreme goal. 12  I am easily attained by the person who always remembers me and is attached to nothing else. Such a person is a true yogi, Arjuna. 15 Great souls make their lives perfect and discover me; they are freed from mortality and the suffering of this separate existence. 16 Every creature in the universe is subject to rebirth, Arjuna, except the one who is united with me. 14  Those who understand the cosmic laws know that the Day of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas and the Night of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas. 18 When the day of Brahma dawns, forms are brought forth from the Unmanifest; when the night of Brahma comes, these forms merge in the Formless again. 19 This multitude of beings is created and destroyed again and again in the succeeding days and nights of Brahma. 20 But beyond this formless state there is another, unmanifested reality, which is eternal and is not dissolved when the cosmos is destroyed. 21 Those who realize life’s supreme goal know that I am unmanifested and unchanging. Having come home to me, they never return to separate existence. 17  This supreme Lord who pervades all existence, the true Self of all creatures, may be realized through undivided love. 23 There are two paths, Arjuna, which the soul may follow at the time of death. One leads to rebirth and the other to liberation. 22  \fThe six months of the northern path of the sun, the path of light, of fire, of day, of the bright fortnight, leads knowers of Brahman to the supreme goal. 25 The six months of the southern path of the sun, the path of smoke, of night, of the dark fortnight, leads other souls to the light of the moon and to rebirth. 24  These two paths, the light and the dark, are said to be eternal, leading some to liberation and others to rebirth. 27 Once you have known these two paths, Arjuna, you can never be deluded again. Attain this knowledge through perseverance in yoga. 28 There is merit in studying the scriptures, in selfless service, austerity, and giving, but the practice of meditation carries you beyond all these to the supreme abode of the highest Lord. 26  \fChapter Nine  The Royal Path This chapter praises Krishna as the Supreme Being who has created the world and dwells immanent in his creation. Krishna’s exalted nature is stressed, and warning is given to those who think that God is limited to his creation. It is true that Krishna has taken on a human form, but those who see only a limited human being and show him disrespect are courting great spiritual harm. These verses contain a warning for those who would underestimate Krishna’s divine power. In this chapter Krishna replaces the many gods and goddesses of the usual Hindu pantheon, each of which represents a different divine power; here Krishna is seen as containing within himself all such powers. It is Krishna and Krishna alone who is to be worshipped: he is the goal, the support, the only refuge, the one true friend; he is the beginning and the end (9:18). It follows that those who practice a ritual religion, offering the ritual sacrifices ordained by the Vedas, do not attain the true goal of their lives. True, they do enjoy heaven after death. But when their store of merit is used up, they are born again in order to have another chance at turning away from personal gain and aiming at life’s supreme goal. So long as they are motivated only by self-centered desires they must be born again and again, and their spiritual evolution either stands still or they make very little progress. Even these souls, however, are really worshipping Krishna, though they do not know it. They seek Krishna, the Supreme Being, in all their wanderings through many, many lives and even in their sojourns in heaven, where they enjoy the reward of their good deeds. Because they do not know his real nature, however, they will not attain the goal, but will be reborn. An endless round of rebirths may seem like a living damnation of the struggling soul – a harsh note that would be uncharacteristic of the Gita. But this is not a question of damnation. The purpose of life is to realize God, and until this is done, the soul cannot escape creating more karma which has to be worked out, however many lives it might take. The choice to turn toward Self-realization is always open.  \fThe Gita does not dwell on the obstacles, however, but quickly goes on to reveal Krishna’s more compassionate nature. It makes the point that whatever a person deeply desires – whatever he or she worships – will eventually be attained, in some life or other. In particular, to have real, selfless love, regardless of the object, is to love Krishna, the ultimate good. This kind of love, called bhakti, is far more potent than observances and rituals – a point the Gita is slowly revealing. But to have this devotion without understanding Krishna’s nature is not enough. In the end, to attain his goal, Arjuna must have devotion and understand it is Krishna’s universal aspect that he loves. Then he will truly attain the eternal, immortal state. This chapter contains a famous and very popular series of verses: Whatever you do, make it an offering to me – the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. In this way you will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and painful. (9:27–28) Krishna accepts every offering made to him in the right spirit; he assures Arjuna of this. Then he demands that Arjuna make everything – every act, every meal, every sacrifice, every gift, even his sufferings – an offering to God. He demands this so that Arjuna can be released from the bondage of karma. This is a new emphasis, a new way. If Arjuna can live in complete union with Krishna’s will, doing everything for Krishna alone, then by that very purity of will he will be free from selfish motives and thus released from karma. His spirit will be free, and he will attain his goal of mystic union with Krishna. Krishna declares that he is impartial to all creatures: he neither favors nor rejects anyone. It is their sincere love that is important. Those who are truly devoted to Krishna live in him, and he abides in them. With some daring, probably at the risk of discomfort to the more orthodox, Krishna adds that even a sinner who takes wholehearted refuge in him becomes good. The word used is sadhu, which literally means a good person but has come to signify one who leads the spiritual life, giving up all selfish desires to achieve the final goal. The word for sinner, sudurachara, should not be passed by either. Su is literally “good”; dur is “bad”: thus “one whose conduct is really bad,” as we might say “good and hot” to mean really hot.  \fKrishna promises that his devotees must attain peace at last. No one who has genuine love and devotion can perish. The meaning here is taken to be “perish” in a spiritual sense, come to spiritual harm. The message of this chapter is simple. It contains no philosophy and only a little theology. The one message is: anyone who has real love, love for the Lord of Love who is in all creatures, will in the end attain the goal. This is the royal secret that Krishna had promised to reveal. –D.M.  \f9: The Royal Path KRISHNA  Because of your faith, I shall tell you the most profound of secrets: obtaining both jnana and vijnana, you will be free from all evil. 1  This royal knowledge, this royal secret, is the greatest purifier. Righteous and imperishable, it is a joy to practice and can be directly experienced. 3 But those who have no faith in the supreme law of life do not find me, Arjuna. They return to the world, passing from death to death. 2  I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifested form. All creatures find their existence in me, but I am not limited by them. 5 Behold my divine mystery! These creatures do not really dwell in me, and though I bring them forth and support them, I am not confined within them. 6 They move in me as the winds move in every direction in space. 4  At the end of the eon these creatures return to unmanifested matter; at the beginning of the next cycle I send them forth again. 8 Controlling my prakriti, again and again I bring forth these myriad forms and subject them to the laws of prakriti. 9 None of these actions binds me, Arjuna. I am unattached to them, so they do not disturb my nature. 7  Under my watchful eye the laws of nature take their course. Thus is the world set in motion; thus the animate and the inanimate are created. 10  \fThe immature do not look beyond physical appearances to see my true nature as the Lord of all creation. 12 The knowledge of such deluded people is empty; their lives are fraught with disaster and evil, and their work and hopes are all in vain. 11  But truly great souls seek my divine nature. They worship me with a one-pointed mind, having realized that I am the eternal source of all. 14 Constantly striving, they make firm their resolve and worship me without wavering. Full of devotion, they sing of my divine glory. 13  Others follow the path of jnana, spiritual wisdom. They see that where there is One, that One is me; where there are many, all are me; they see my face everywhere. 15  I am the ritual and the sacrifice; I am true medicine and the mantram. I am the offering and the fire which consumes it, and the one to whom it is offered. 16  I am the father and mother of this universe, and its grandfather too; I am its entire support. I am the sum of all knowledge, the purifier, the syllable Om; I am the sacred scriptures, the Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas. 17  I am the goal of life, the Lord and support of all, the inner witness, the abode of all. I am the only refuge, the one true friend; I am the beginning, the staying, and the end of creation; I am the womb and the eternal seed. 18  I am heat; I give and withhold the rain. I am immortality and I am death; I am what is and what is not. 19  Those who follow the rituals given in the Vedas, who offer sacrifices and take soma, free themselves from evil and attain the vast heaven of the gods, where they enjoy celestial pleasures. 21 When they have enjoyed these fully, their merit is exhausted and they return to this land of death. Thus observing Vedic rituals but caught in an endless chain of desires, they come and go. 20  \fThose who worship me and meditate on me constantly, without any other thought – I will provide for all their needs. 22  Those who worship other gods with faith and devotion also worship me, Arjuna, even if they do not observe the usual forms. 24 I am the object of all worship, its enjoyer and Lord. But those who fail to realize my true nature must be reborn. 25 Those who worship the devas will go to the realm of the devas; those who worship their ancestors will be united with them after death. Those who worship phantoms will become phantoms; but my devotees will come to me. 23  Whatever I am offered in devotion with a pure heart – a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water – I accept with joy. 27 Whatever you do, make it an offering to me – the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. 28 In this way you will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and painful. Then, firm in renunciation and yoga, with your heart free, you will come to me. 26  I look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and none more dear. But those who worship me with love live in me, and I come to life in them. 29  Even sinners become holy when they take refuge in me alone. 31 Quickly their souls conform to dharma and they attain to boundless peace. Never forget this, Arjuna: no one who is devoted to me will ever come to harm. 30  All those who take refuge in me, whatever their birth, race, sex, or caste, will attain the supreme goal; this realization can be attained even by those whom society scorns. 33 Kings and sages too seek this goal with devotion. Therefore, having been born in this transient and forlorn world, give all your love to me. 34 Fill your mind with me; love me; serve me; worship me always. Seeking me in your heart, you will at last be united with me. 32  \fChapter Ten  Divine Splendor Krishna goes deeper into the revelation of his divine being, revealing himself as the source from which all things come, the One who is the reality behind the many. Though the source of all virtues, he is also the ultimate reality that transcends all opposites. Thus he is both happiness and suffering, birth and death, being and nonbeing. Like the Brahman of the Upanishads, he is beyond duality, utterly beyond the constricting categories of the things of this world. His true nature is beyond the reach of thought. He can only be known in the state of samadhi, where knower and known become one. Arjuna calls Krishna Purushottama, “the supreme Purusha, the supreme Person.” Krishna is now no human charioteer but Bhagavan, “the munificent Lord”; and Arjuna, leaving his warrior persona behind, now stands revealed as a seeker after truth. At Arjuna’s request, Krishna now reveals a few of his divine powers and attributes (vibhutis). From this point on the chapter becomes difficult because of the many unfamiliar names that are mentioned. In whatever category, Krishna is the chief, the best, the most intense, the most beautiful, the most awesome, the essence. Many of the allusions will be familiar – for example, among rivers Krishna is the Ganges. But many of the names come from Hindu mythology and are not well known. There is no room here to explain every name, but the following paragraphs will highlight a few of importance. First, Krishna is the Atman, the inner Self in all beings. It is fitting that this be mentioned first, for of all his myriad manifestations this is the most important, at least to the struggling spiritual aspirant that is Arjuna. Krishna is Arjuna’s innermost Self, and that is how he is to be known in contemplation. Of all the forms in which to meditate upon Krishna, the Atman is mentioned first. Krishna is Vishnu, the great compassionate, sustaining God of the Hindu faith. It is Vishnu who cares so much about the sufferings of Mother Earth and her children that he comes to earth again and again, in age after age, to relieve oppression and renew righteousness.  \fKrishna is the sun, worshipped in India since ancient times. He is Indra, the chief of the Vedic gods, the lord of storm and battle, who hurls the thunderbolt against the enemies of the gods. In Vedic religion he is a mighty lord, not to be trifled with, but later on he must admit defeat at the hands of Krishna, who protects the people from Indra’s stormy wrath. Krishna is also Shankara, the more beneficent aspect of the awesome deity Rudra, better known as Shiva. Among mountains Krishna is Meru, the high mountain home of Shiva and the other gods, the highest peak and center of the world. Krishna is consciousness, the syllable Om, and the mantram or holy name. He is the mythic horse and the fabulous elephant that were produced when the cosmic ocean was churned for the elixir of immortality. Krishna is Ananta, the cosmic serpent on which Lord Vishnu sleeps. He is Varuna, Vedic god of the oceans, and Yama, the god of death; among demons (asuras) he is Prahlada, who, though born in the race of demons, was devoted to God and never swayed in his love, even when his own father tried to kill him. And of course Krishna is Rama, the great warriorprince – also an incarnation of Vishnu – whose exploits are told in the immortal epic, the Ramayana. Of all fields of knowledge, Krishna says, he is knowledge of the Self. The study of Sanskrit and its grammar were important in ancient India, and Krishna doesn’t neglect this field. He is A among letters; among compound words he is the dvandva, which joins equals. He is the Gayatri – a particular meter found in the poetry of the Vedas, but generally taken to be a famous prayer from the Rig Veda (iii.62.10) composed in that meter, which has been chanted every morning by countless worshippers for three thousand years. It is fitting that among seasons Krishna is the spring, the season of flowers. Less easily understood is his claim to be the gambling of gamblers. Krishna has a sense of play, and as gambling is the obsession of the gambler, it seems natural that Krishna might claim this as a vibhuti. Also, in ancient India gambling was considered a royal pastime, and no king of repute would refuse a friendly game of dice. In the human realm, Krishna is the “son of Vasudeva,” a prince of the Vrishni line – in other words, the human form that is Arjuna’s friend and charioteer. He is also Arjuna! And he is Vyasa, the composer of the Gita – indeed, of the whole Mahabharata.  \fWherever Arjuna finds strength, beauty, or power, Krishna concludes, he should recognize it as coming from a spark of Krishna’s glory. Then, after overwhelming Arjuna with this stupendous list of divine powers and revelations, Krishna asks casually, “But what use is it to know all of these details? The important fact is to know that I am, and that a tiny portion of my being supports all things.” –D.M.  \f10: Divine Splendor KRISHNA  Listen further, Arjuna, to my supreme teaching, which gives you such joy. Desiring your welfare, O strong-armed warrior, I will tell you more. 1  Neither gods nor sages know my origin, for I am the source from which the gods and sages come. 3 Whoever knows me as the Lord of all creation, without birth or beginning, knows the truth and frees himself from all evil. 2  Discrimination, wisdom, understanding, forgiveness, truth, selfcontrol, and peace of mind; pleasure and pain, birth and death, fear and courage, honor and dishonor; 5 nonviolence, charity, equanimity, contentment, and perseverance in spiritual disciplines – all the different qualities found in living creatures have their source in me. 4  The seven great sages and the four ancient ancestors were born from my mind and received my power. From them came all the creatures of this world. 7 Whoever understands my power and the mystery of my manifestations comes without doubt to be united with me. 6  I am the source from which all creatures evolve. The wise remember this and worship me with loving devotion. 9 Their thoughts are all absorbed in me, and all their vitality flows to me. Teaching one another, talking about me always, they are happy and fulfilled. 8  \fTo those steadfast in love and devotion I give spiritual wisdom, so that they may come to me. 11 Out of compassion I destroy the darkness of their ignorance. From within them I light the lamp of wisdom and dispel all darkness from their lives. 10  ARJUNA  You are Brahman supreme, the highest abode, the supreme purifier, the self-luminous, eternal spirit, first among the gods, unborn and infinite. 13 The great sages and seers – Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa too – have acclaimed you thus; now you have declared it to me yourself. 12  Now, O Krishna, I believe that everything you have told me is divine truth. O Lord, neither gods nor demons know your real nature. 15 Indeed, you alone know yourself, O supreme spirit. You are the source of being and the master of every creature, God of gods, the Lord of the universe. 14  Tell me all your divine attributes, leaving nothing unsaid. Tell me of the glories with which you fill the cosmos. 17 Krishna, you are a supreme master of yoga. Tell me how I should meditate to gain constant awareness of you. In what things and in what ways should I meditate on you? 18 O Krishna, you who stir up people’s hearts, tell me in detail your attributes and your powers; I can never tire of hearing your immortal words. 16  KRISHNA  All right, Arjuna, I will tell you of my divine powers. I will mention only the most glorious; for there is no end to them. 19  I am the true Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence. 20  Among the shining gods I am Vishnu; of luminaries I am the sun; among the storm gods I am Marichi, and in the night sky I am the moon. 21  \fAmong scriptures I am the Sama Veda, and among the lesser gods I am Indra. Among the senses I am the mind, and in living beings I am consciousness. 22  Among the Rudras I am Shankara. Among the spirits of the natural world I am Kubera, god of wealth, and Pavaka, the purifying fire. Among mountains I am Meru. 23  Among priests I am Brihaspati, and among military leaders I am Skanda. Among bodies of water I am the ocean. 24  Among the great seers I am Bhrigu, and among words, the syllable Om; I am the repetition of the holy name, and among mountains I am the Himalayas. 25  Among trees I am the ashvattha, the sacred fig; among the gandharvas, the heavenly musicians, I am Chitraratha. Among divine seers I am Narada, and among sages I am Kapila. 26  I was born from the nectar of immortality as the primordial horse and as Indra’s noble elephant. Among human beings, I am the king. 27  Among weapons I am the thunderbolt. I am Kamadhuk, the cow that fulfills all desires; I am Kandarpa, the power of sex, and Vasuki, the king of snakes. 28  I am Ananta, the cosmic serpent, and Varuna, the god of water; I am Aryaman among the noble ancestors. Among the forces which restrain I am Yama, the god of death. 29  Among animals I am the lion; among birds, the eagle Garuda. I am Prahlada, born among the demons, and of all that measures, I am time. 30  Among purifying forces I am the wind; among warriors, Rama. Of water creatures I am the crocodile, and of rivers I am the Ganges. 31  \fI am the beginning, middle, and end of creation. Of all the sciences I am the science of Self-knowledge, and I am logic in those who debate. 33 Among letters I am A; among grammatical compounds I am the dvandva. I am infinite time, and the sustainer whose face is seen everywhere. 32  I am death, which overcomes all, and the source of all beings still to be born. I am the feminine qualities: fame, beauty, perfect speech, memory, intelligence, loyalty, and forgiveness. 34  Among the hymns of the Sama Veda I am the Brihat; among poetic meters, the Gayatri. Among months I am Margashirsha, first of the year; among seasons I am spring, that brings forth flowers. 35  I am the gambling of the gambler and the radiance in all that shines. I am effort, I am victory, and I am the goodness of the virtuous. 36  Among the Vrishnis I am Krishna, and among the Pandavas I am Arjuna. Among sages I am Vyasa, and among poets, Ushanas. 37  I am the scepter which metes out punishment, and the art of statesmanship in those who lead. I am the silence of the unknown and the wisdom of the wise. 38  I am the seed that can be found in every creature, Arjuna; for without me nothing can exist, neither animate nor inanimate. 39  But there is no end to my divine attributes, Arjuna; these I have mentioned are only a few. 41 Wherever you find strength, or beauty, or spiritual power, you may be sure that these have sprung from a spark of my essence. 40  But of what use is it to you to know all this, Arjuna? Just remember that I am, and that I support the entire cosmos with only a fragment of my being. 42  \fChapter Eleven  The Cosmic Vision This is the most exalted chapter of the entire Gita, for here Arjuna sees the divine vision of Krishna in his full nature as God himself, Lord of the Universe. It is difficult to see at first why the ultimate spiritual vision should be granted to Arjuna at this point. We must remember that Krishna and Arjuna have been companions for many lives. Yet at the opening of the Gita, Arjuna is a warrior, little concerned with mystic visions. Step by step Krishna has led him to an understanding of the real purpose of his life – to know who he is and to know also who Krishna is. In the last chapter, Krishna had reached the point where he was willing to reveal to Arjuna the manifestations of divine power. Arjuna had not only asked about those powers, but had even wanted to know in which forms he might meditate on Krishna – the first time Arjuna had spoken of contemplation. Now, in chapter 11, Arjuna asks to see Krishna as He really is. His desire is granted, and in essence the rest of the chapter describes Arjuna’s samadhi. Samadhi is the word used by Patanjali in his classic work, the Yoga Sutras, to describe the final stage in meditation, in which the mind is completely concentrated and a superconscious mode of knowing comes into play. Patanjali speaks of many different kinds of samadhi, but for practical purposes we may speak of two: savikalpa and nirvikalpa. Arjuna’s vision begins with savikalpa samadhi, in which he sees God in a personal manifestation. Then, as he passes into nirvikalpa samadhi, Arjuna sees all forms disappearing into God, until only a supernatural fire consuming the entire phenomenal world is left. This supreme vision dazzles Arjuna with the blinding splendor of a thousand suns. Mystics have often described their experiences in terms of light. In an ancient prayer of the Veda, the poet asks for divine wisdom to dawn in his heart just as the sun rises in the sky. And in the West we have countless testimonies like that of St. Teresa of Avila: When the soul looks upon this Divine Sun, the brightness dazzles it. . . . And very often it remains completely blind, absorbed, amazed, and dazzled by all the wonders it sees.  \fAs this vision begins to unfold, Arjuna sees the whole world in the body of Krishna and he begins a hymn of praise. He sees Krishna as Vishnu with his traditional weapons, the mace and the discus, and wearing a crown. As the vision becomes more intense, Arjuna begins to feel afraid. He sees the light of God become a fire that burns to consume all things, as if at the end of time. All the warriors on the battlefield are mortals, and Arjuna sees them slain, burning in the universal fire. All creatures rush to destruction like moths into a flame. God’s radiance is both a great light and a burning fire. Terrified, Arjuna wants to know the identity of this awesome God, who bears no resemblance now to the Krishna he had known as his teacher and friend. In answer to the question, “Who are you?” Krishna’s reply is the verse (11:32) that burst into Robert Oppenheimer’s mind when he saw the atomic bomb explode over Trinity in the summer of 1945: “I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds. . . .” But the word kala means not just death but time, which eventually devours all. Arjuna is brave, and worthy of this vision, for he does not lose consciousness or completely break down. He praises Krishna and then asks for forgiveness if during their long friendship he has ever said or done anything to offend the Lord through mistaking him for a mere human being. Finally, the vision is too much for Arjuna. Though he experiences the deep peace and joy of samadhi, he is terrified at the same time. He wishes to see the more human face of God. Krishna grants his desire and returns to his gentle, normal aspect. He tells Arjuna how very difficult it is to see him in his exalted form as the Lord of Yoga, the God of gods. Only pure devotion attains this vision. This theme dominates the remaining chapters of the Gita: it is devotion that is allimportant on the spiritual quest. – D.M.  \f11: The Cosmic Vision ARJUNA  Out of compassion you have taught me the supreme mystery of the Self. Through your words my delusion is gone. 2 You have explained the origin and end of every creature, O lotus-eyed one, and told me of your own supreme, limitless existence. 1  Just as you have described your infinite glory, O Lord, now I long to see it. I want to see you as the supreme ruler of creation. 4 O Lord, master of yoga, if you think me strong enough to behold it, show me your immortal Self. 3  KRISHNA  Behold, Arjuna, a million divine forms, with an infinite variety of color and shape. 6 Behold the gods of the natural world, and many more wonders never revealed before. 7 Behold the entire cosmos turning within my body, and the other things you desire to see. 5  But these things cannot be seen with your physical eyes; therefore I give you spiritual vision to perceive my majestic power. 8  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, Krishna, the master of yoga, revealed to Arjuna his most exalted, lordly form. 9  He appeared with an infinite number of faces, ornamented by heavenly jewels, displaying unending miracles and the countless weapons of his power. 11 Clothed in celestial garments and covered with garlands, sweet-smelling with heavenly fragrances, he showed 10  \fhimself as the infinite Lord, the source of all wonders, whose face is everywhere. If a thousand suns were to rise in the heavens at the same time, the blaze of their light would resemble the splendor of that supreme spirit. 12  There, within the body of the God of gods, Arjuna saw all the manifold forms of the universe united as one. 14 Filled with amazement, his hair standing on end in ecstasy, he bowed before the Lord with joined palms and spoke these words. 13  ARJUNA  O Lord, I see within your body all the gods and every kind of living creature. I see Brahma, the Creator, seated on a lotus; I see the ancient sages and the celestial serpents. 15  I see infinite mouths and arms, stomachs and eyes, and you are embodied in every form. I see you everywhere, without beginning, middle, or end. You are the Lord of all creation, and the cosmos is your body. 16  You wear a crown and carry a mace and discus; your radiance is blinding and immeasurable. I see you, who are so difficult to behold, shining like a fiery sun blazing in every direction. 17  You are the supreme, changeless Reality, the one thing to be known. You are the refuge of all creation, the immortal spirit, the eternal guardian of eternal dharma. 18  You are without beginning, middle, or end; you touch everything with your infinite power. The sun and moon are your eyes, and your mouth is fire; your radiance warms the cosmos. 19  O Lord, your presence fills the heavens and the earth and reaches in every direction. I see the three worlds trembling before this vision of your wonderful and terrible form. 20  \fThe gods enter your being, some calling out and greeting you in fear. Great saints sing your glory, praying, “May all be well!” 21  The multitudes of gods, demigods, and demons are all overwhelmed by the sight of you. 23 O mighty Lord, at the sight of your myriad eyes and mouths, arms and legs, stomachs and fearful teeth, I and the entire universe shake in terror. 22  O Vishnu, I can see your eyes shining; with open mouth, you glitter in an array of colors, and your body touches the sky. I look at you and my heart trembles; I have lost all courage and all peace of mind. 24  When I see your mouths with their fearful teeth, mouths burning like the fires at the end of time, I forget where I am and I have no place to go. O Lord, you are the support of the universe; have mercy on me! 25  I see all the sons of Dhritarashtra; I see Bhishma, Drona, and Karna; I see our warriors and all the kings who are here to fight. 27 All are rushing into your awful jaws; I see some of them crushed by your teeth. 28 As rivers flow into the ocean, all the warriors of this world are passing into your fiery jaws; 29 all creatures rush to their destruction like moths into a flame. 26  You lap the worlds into your burning mouths and swallow them. Filled with your terrible radiance, O Vishnu, the whole of creation bursts into flames. 30  Tell me who you are, O Lord of terrible form. I bow before you; have mercy! I want to know who you are, you who existed before all creation. Your nature and workings confound me. 31  KRISHNA  I am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world. Even without your participation, all the warriors gathered here will die. 32  \fTherefore arise, Arjuna; conquer your enemies and enjoy the glory of sovereignty. I have already slain all these warriors; you will only be my instrument. 33  Bhishma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna, and many others are already slain. Kill those whom I have killed. Do not hesitate. Fight in this battle and you will conquer your enemies. 34  SANJAYA  Having heard these words, Arjuna trembled in fear. With joined palms he bowed before Krishna and addressed him stammering. 35  ARJUNA  O Krishna, it is right that the world delights and rejoices in your praise, that all the saints and sages bow down to you and all evil flees before you to the far corners of the universe. 36  How could they not worship you, O Lord? You are the eternal spirit, who existed before Brahma the Creator and who will never cease to be. Lord of the gods, you are the abode of the universe. Changeless, you are what is and what is not, and beyond the duality of existence and nonexistence. 37  You are the first among the gods, the timeless spirit, the resting place of all beings. You are the knower and the thing which is known. You are the final home; with your infinite form you pervade the cosmos. 38  You are Vayu, god of wind; Yama, god of death; Agni, god of fire; Varuna, god of water. You are the moon and the creator Prajapati, and the great-grandfather of all creatures. I bow before you and salute you again and again. 39  You are behind me and in front of me; I bow to you on every side. Your power is immeasurable. You pervade everything; you are everything. 40  \fSometimes, because we were friends, I rashly said, “Oh, Krishna! Say, friend!” – casual, careless remarks. Whatever I may have said lightly, whether we were playing or resting, alone or in company, sitting together or eating, 42 if it was disrespectful, forgive me for it, O Krishna. I did not know the greatness of your nature, unchanging and imperishable. 41  You are the father of the universe, of the animate and the inanimate; you are the object of all worship, the greatest guru. There is none to equal you in the three worlds. Who can match your power? 44 O gracious Lord, I prostrate myself before you and ask for your blessing. As a father forgives his son, or a friend a friend, or a lover his beloved, so should you forgive me. 43  I rejoice in seeing you as you have never been seen before, yet I am filled with fear by this vision of you as the abode of the universe. Please let me see you again as the shining God of gods. 46 Though you are the embodiment of all creation, let me see you again not with a thousand arms but with four, carrying the mace and discus and wearing a crown. 45  KRISHNA  Arjuna, through my grace you have been united with me and received this vision of my radiant, universal form, without beginning or end, which no one else has ever seen. 47  Not by knowledge of the Vedas, nor sacrifice, nor charity, nor rituals, nor even by severe asceticism has any other mortal seen what you have seen, O heroic Arjuna. 48  Do not be troubled; do not fear my terrible form. Let your heart be satisfied and your fears dispelled in looking at me as I was before. 49  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, the Lord once again assumed the gentle form of Krishna and consoled his devotee, who had been so 50  \fafraid. ARJUNA  O Krishna, now that I have seen your gentle human form my mind is again composed and returned to normal. 51  KRISHNA  It is extremely difficult to obtain the vision you have had; even the gods long always to see me in this aspect. 53 Neither knowledge of the Vedas, nor austerity, nor charity, nor sacrifice can bring the vision you have seen. 54 But through unfailing devotion, Arjuna, you can know me, see me, and attain union with me. 55 Those who make me the supreme goal of all their work and act without selfish attachment, who devote themselves to me completely and are free from ill will for any creature, enter into me. 52  \fChapter Twelve  The Way of Love This short chapter focuses upon the supreme importance of devotion and faith in spiritual development. Here love, or personal devotion, is the most powerful motivation in spiritual life. The world’s great religions agree on this point. All religions allow for a way of devotion, and millions of men and women have found spiritual fulfillment in devotion to Christ, the Buddha, or Muhammad. Hinduism has allowed a place for the path of knowledge as well as the path of devotion; here, however, the Gita stresses the efficacy of devotion. The Upanishads, the final word on mystic experience uttered by the Vedas, stressed the ultimate reality, the eternal truth behind the ephemeral things of this world. The teachers of the Upanishads told their students to seek knowledge of the Atman, their true Self. The consummation of this knowledge was to know that the Self within was one with Brahman, the ultimate reality pervading all things. This was encapsulated in the statement Tat tvam asi, “You are that” – that imperishable being, that immortal Reality. Brahman, the nameless, formless Godhead, could be known only in the superconscious state. The Gita moves away from such an approach to religion. For as Krishna says, seeking an eternal, indefinable, hidden Godhead is rather a tall order for the average (or even above average) person. In fact, in this chapter it is said to be beyond the reach of practically all “embodied beings” (dehavat, “those who have bodies”). This path of wisdom may be just too “spiritual” for earth’s children, because those who identify to a large degree with their physical nature find the way of knowledge too steep a climb. We can turn to one of the Western followers of this path to see why; this is Dionysius the Areopagite, a Christian monk of the fifth century, sounding remarkably like verses 3–4 of this very chapter: Then, beyond all distinction between knower and known, the aspirant becomes merged in the nameless, formless Reality, wholly absorbed in That which is beyond all things and in nothing else. . . . Having stilled  \fhis intellect and mind, he is united by his highest faculty with That which is beyond all knowing. Fortunately there is the path of love; for when God is loved in personal aspect, the way is vastly easier. According to the Hindu scriptures, God can be loved as a merciful father, a divine mother, a wise friend, a passionate beloved, or even as a mischievous child. We might turn to the Christian mystics for help here, for most of them have walked the way of love. The medieval Christian work called The Cloud of Unknowing states that love is the sure, safe path to God: “By love He can be gotten and holden, by thought never.” In a well-known passage in the New Testament, St. Paul puts love above knowledge and even above miraculous powers: “But I shall give you a more excellent way. . . . Love never faileth. But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.” And St. John of the Cross tells concisely why the vast majority of human beings find it easier to overcome their weaknesses through love than through knowledge: In order to overcome our desires and to renounce all those things, our love and inclination for which are wont to inflame the will that it delights therein, we require a more ardent fire and a nobler love – that of the Bridegroom. . . . if our spiritual nature were not on fire with other and nobler passions, we should never cast off the yoke of the senses. But such love is often not forthcoming in the struggling soul, even in one like Arjuna. So Krishna says that if Arjuna is not able to focus his devotion, he should learn to do so through the regular practice of meditation. Even love and devotion can be cultivated through regular practice; they needn’t be regarded as mysterious forces, divine gifts of the spirit. If even the attempt at regular practice should fail, Krishna is still not ready to let Arjuna admit defeat. He should, Krishna says, work selflessly without desire for the fruits of his labors. But real peace of mind comes only from renunciation. The word tyaga here seems to mean renunciation or abandonment of self-will more than anything else. Such self-surrender may be a last resort, but if it is genuine it brings immediate peace.  \fVerses 13–20 describe the characteristics of the genuine lover of God. Such a saintly person, Krishna points out, is greatly loved and dear to Krishna himself. –D.M.  \f12: The Way of Love ARJUNA  Of those steadfast devotees who love you and those who seek you as the eternal formless Reality, who are the more established in yoga? 1  KRISHNA  Those who set their hearts on me and worship me with unfailing devotion and faith are more established in yoga. 2  As for those who seek the transcendental Reality, without name, without form, contemplating the Unmanifested, beyond the reach of thought and of feeling, 4 with their senses subdued and mind serene and striving for the good of all beings, they too will verily come unto me. 3  Yet hazardous and slow is the path to the Unrevealed, difficult for physical creatures to tread. 6 But they for whom I am the supreme goal, who do all work renouncing self for me and meditate on me with single-hearted devotion, 7 these I will swiftly rescue from the fragment’s cycle of birth and death, for their consciousness has entered into me. 5  Still your mind in me, still your intellect in me, and without doubt you will be united with me forever. 9 If you cannot still your mind in me, learn to do so through the regular practice of meditation. 10 If you lack the will for such self-discipline, engage yourself in my work, for selfless service can lead you at last to complete fulfillment. 11 If you are unable to do even this, surrender yourself to 8  \fme, disciplining yourself and renouncing the results of all your actions. Better indeed is knowledge than mechanical practice. Better than knowledge is meditation. But better still is surrender of attachment to results, because there follows immediate peace. 12  That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of “I” and “mine” and of pleasure and pain, 14 patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me – with such as these I am in love. 13  Not agitating the world or by it agitated, they stand above the sway of elation, competition, and fear: that one is my beloved. 15  They are detached, pure, efficient, impartial, never anxious, selfless in all their undertakings; they are my devotees, very dear to me. 16  That one is dear to me who runs not after the pleasant or away from the painful, grieves not, lusts not, but lets things come and go as they happen. 17  That devotee who looks upon friend and foe with equal regard, who is not buoyed up by praise nor cast down by blame, alike in heat and cold, pleasure and pain, free from selfish attachments, 19 the same in honor and dishonor, quiet, ever full, in harmony everywhere, firm in faith – such a one is dear to me. 18  Those who meditate upon this immortal dharma as I have declared it, full of faith and seeking me as life’s supreme goal, are truly my devotees, and my love for them is very great. 20  \fChapter Thirteen  The Field & the Knower This chapter presents us with two sweeping categories: the “field” and the “knower of the field.” To simplify, we may think of the field as the body and the knower of the field as the Self that resides in the body. This chapter, then, is about the duality between “soul and body.” This duality is seen as eternal, a basic division of all things – a fundamental concept elaborated in Sankhya philosophy. We said that the “field” is the body, but this is not precise enough. The field also includes the mind: in fact, it comprises all the components of prakriti including ahamkara – the awareness each of us has that we are an individual ego, from aham “I” and kara “maker.” Ahamkara is the basic awareness of separateness: that which makes me “I,” a being separate from the rest of creation. In this wide sense the field encompasses everything, except for the elusive consciousness that “knows” the field. The field is the object; the knower is the subject. Krishna is the hidden knower of the field: that is, the Self. This term “field” is a surprisingly modern one, for it describes what today we might call an extension of the continuum of mass, energy, time, and space to include the strata of mind as well – in other words, a field of forces both physical and mental. Just as physics no longer regards matter and energy as essentially separate, the Gita would not regard matter and mind as separate; they are different aspects of prakriti, the underlying “stuff” of existence. Another dimension of Krishna’s use of the word “field” is brought out by a traditional Hindu anecdote. A wandering sadhu or holy man is asked what his work in life is; he replies, “I’m a farmer.” When the questioner looks surprised he adds, “This body of mine is my field. I sow good thoughts and actions, and in my body I reap the results.” The Buddha explains, “All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts; it is made of our thoughts.” What we think, we become, for as Emerson says, the ancestor of every action is a thought. Thus our thoughts, taken together, bear fruit in the actions, decisions, and desires that shape our lives. In part, the body bears the fruit of what we think insofar as our way of  \fthinking affects our health and safety. But in a larger sense, the whole field of human activity (indeed the whole of prakriti) is also a “field of karma” – where, for example, the global environment is shaped by the sum of what its inhabitants do, which in turn is shaped by how they think. This idea will be picked up and elaborated on in detail in the concluding chapters of the Gita. Verses 7–11 then describe the person who understands his or her own true nature. This is an attractive picture of the modest, truly wise person who is in control of his or her own life. One implication of these verses is that it is quite an achievement to understand the difference between the field and the Self, the knower. Most people confuse the two, taking the body and mind to be who they are. In the usual course of events, we may be totally unaware that there is a Self, a consciousness underneath the surface awareness of a separate “I.” Verses 12–17 describe the ultimate underlying reality: Brahman, pure, undifferentiated consciousness, the divine ground of existence. Verse 19 returns us to the discussion of the basic duality of mind/matter and spirit (Self). Again the technical terms prakriti and Purusha are used. Purusha is the knower and prakriti the field. From the union of these two all things are born. Both prakriti and Purusha are essential to the creation of the world: nothing could exist without the spiritual basis of Purusha, and nothing could develop in a manifest form without the mind and matter of prakriti. With its need to think of abstract principles in human terms, Hinduism embodies these two eternal principles in the figures of Shiva and Shakti, the divine Father and Mother. The Gita does not mention these two because it comes essentially from the Vishnu tradition, but in the other great stream of the Hindu faith, Shiva is the eternal Spirit, the Absolute, represented as dwelling aloof on the mountain peak of spiritual peace. Shakti, the Divine Mother, is his creative partner, and without her, Shiva could never have created the world. Shakti – she has many names in her various manifestations – rules in the realm of birth and death; Shiva, Purusha, lives in the realm of the immortal. Together the two represent Brahman, the attributeless Godhead, and the creative power of the Godhead called maya. Thus it is in the union of Shiva and Shakti that all things are born. This chapter emphasizes that the Self, the real knower, is ever uninvolved in the shifting forces that play over the field. There is no possibility of any  \fsoul being eternally lost, for all beings partake of the immortal, pure nature of Purusha. We may endure countless eons of birth and death, but we must finally find our rest in the eternal spirit. By definition, nothing taking place in the realm of prakriti can affect Purusha; but the exact nature of the interaction of these two is a profound mystery. Verse 32 explains this mystery by drawing a comparison with akasha, the subtlest element recognized by the ancient philosophers. Akasha is space itself. Just as space pervades the cosmos, yet remains pure even in the midst of impure things, so the Self remains completely pure, even though it dwells in all things. Though it seems to live in the land of mortals and to undergo change and death, the real knower in every creature is deathless, “hidden in the heart.” –D.M.  \f13: The Field & the Knower KRISHNA  The body is called a field, Arjuna; the one who knows it is called the Knower of the field. This is the knowledge of those who know. 2 I am the Knower of the field in everyone, Arjuna. Knowledge of the field and its Knower is true knowledge. 1  Listen and I will explain the nature of the field and how change takes place within it. I will also describe the Knower of the field and his power. 4 These truths have been sung by great sages in a variety of ways, and expounded in precise arguments concerning Brahman. 3  The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy from which all these evolved. 6 In this field arise desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the body, intelligence, and will. 5  Those who know truly are free from pride and deceit. They are gentle, forgiving, upright, and pure, devoted to their spiritual teacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled. 8 Detached from sense objects and self-will, they have learned the painful lesson of separate birth and suffering, old age, disease, and death. 7  Free from selfish attachment, they do not get compulsively entangled even in home and family. They are even-minded through good fortune and bad. 10 Their devotion to me is undivided. Enjoying solitude and not following the crowd, they seek only me. 9  \fThis is true knowledge, to seek the Self as the true end of wisdom always. To seek anything else is ignorance. 11  I will tell you of the wisdom that leads to immortality: the beginningless Brahman, which can be called neither being nor nonbeing. 12  It dwells in all, in every hand and foot and head, in every mouth and eye and ear in the universe. 14 Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. 13  It is both near and far, both within and without every creature; it moves and is unmoving. 16 In its subtlety it is beyond comprehension. It is indivisible, yet appears divided in separate creatures. Know it to be the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. 15  Dwelling in every heart, it is beyond darkness. It is called the light of light, the object and goal of knowledge, and knowledge itself. 17  I have revealed to you the nature of the field and the meaning and object of true knowledge. Those who are devoted to me, knowing these things, are united with me. 18  Know that prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning, and that from prakriti come the gunas and all that changes. 20 Prakriti is the agent, cause, and effect of every action, but it is Purusha that seems to experience pleasure and pain. 19  Purusha, resting in prakriti, witnesses the play of the gunas born of prakriti. But attachment to the gunas leads a person to be born for good or evil. 21  Within the body the supreme Purusha is called the witness, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the supreme Lord, the highest Self. 22  \fWhoever realizes the true nature of Purusha, prakriti, and the gunas, whatever path he or she may follow, is not born separate again. 23  Some realize the Self within them through the practice of meditation, some by the path of wisdom, and others by selfless service. 25 Others may not know these paths; but hearing and following the instructions of an illumined teacher, they too go beyond death. 24  Whatever exists, Arjuna, animate or inanimate, is born through the union of the field and its Knower. 26  They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. 28 Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. 27  They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved. 30 When they see the variety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they attain fulfillment in Brahman. 29  This supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is touched by action. 32 As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every creature. 31  As the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the source of all light in the field. 34 Those who, with the eye of wisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to freedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal. 33  \fChapter Fourteen  The Forces of Evolution The last chapter gave us the distinction between Purusha and prakriti. This chapter will tell us in more detail about the nature of prakriti – the basis of the world of mind and matter. Here the Gita explains human experience in terms of the three qualities of prakriti, known as gunas: sattva, rajas, and tamas. When the soul attains illumination it goes beyond the confines of prakriti into the spiritual realm of Purusha. But until then, the soul must learn to deal with these three all-powerful forces. No single English word can be given to translate the words sattva, rajas, and tamas. The quality of sattva combines goodness, purity, light, harmony, balance. In terms of evolution, sattva is on the highest level. Rajas is energy – or, on the human level, passion – which can be both good and bad. In personality rajas may express itself in anger, hatred, or greed; but it also provides motivation, the will to act. Rajas is ambitious, which is not altogether a bad thing for the evolution of the soul. It is definitely superior to the third guna, tamas, which combines inertia, sloth, darkness, ignorance, insensitivity. This is the lowest state in terms of evolution; for tamas means a dead stability, where nothing much happens for good or ill. Worse, tamas can mean not just stability but a sliding backwards in the struggle of evolution, where to stand still may mean to be left behind (14:18). In any given personality or phenomenon all the three gunas are likely to be present. It is the mix of the three that colors our experience. Sattva may be dominant, with an admixture of rajas or tamas. Or perhaps rajas dominates, with a little sattva and a good measure of tamas. Finally, the personality may be basically tamasic, with a few rays of the light of sattva and a little of the heat of rajas. In any case, no mix of the three gunas is stable, for it is the very nature of prakriti to be in constant flux. The gunas are constantly shifting, always changing in intensity. It is essential that the gunas, even the purity and goodness of sattva, be transcended if the soul is to attain its final release. For the three gunas are forces that operate within the world of prakriti: in fact, their three strands make up the whole fabric of the phenomenal world. Liberation lies beyond the conditioning of prakriti, in the realm of Purusha. When Arjuna asks  \fKrishna to describe the person who has gone beyond prakriti’s net, Krishna replies that such a person is detached from the constant shifting and interaction of the gunas. Identified with the Self, he or she realizes that the gunas and their play are external – even the emotions and thoughts that seem so personal, so interior, are really only the play of prakriti. Thoughts and emotions, and ahamkara itself, stop at the gate of the inner Self. The Self abides in the inner chamber of the heart, always at peace, whatever forces of prakriti may storm outside. The illumined man or woman maintains a joyful evenness of mind in happiness and sorrow. At the end of the chapter, again reminding him of the power of devotion (bhakti), Krishna says that Arjuna can transcend the gunas through steadfast love. If he has devotion and has gone beyond the three gunas, then he will be fit to know Brahman. –D.M.  \f14: Forces of Evolution KRISHNA  Let me tell you more about the wisdom that transcends all knowledge, through which the saints and sages attained perfection. 2 Those who rely on this wisdom will be united with me. For them there is neither rebirth nor fear of death. 1  My womb is prakriti; in that I place the seed. Thus all created things are born. 4 Everything born, Arjuna, comes from the womb of prakriti, and I am the seed-giving father. 3  It is the three gunas born of prakriti – sattva, rajas, and tamas – that bind the immortal Self to the body. 6 Sattva – pure, luminous, and free from sorrow – binds us with attachment to happiness and wisdom. 7 Rajas is passion, arising from selfish desire and attachment. These bind the Self with compulsive action. 8 Tamas, born of ignorance, deludes all creatures through heedlessness, indolence, and sleep. 5  Sattva binds us to happiness; rajas binds us to action. Tamas, distorting our understanding, binds us to delusion. 9  Sattva predominates when rajas and tamas are transformed. Rajas prevails when sattva is weak and tamas overcome. Tamas prevails when rajas and sattva are dormant. 10  When sattva predominates, the light of wisdom shines through every gate of the body. 12 When rajas predominates, a person runs about pursuing selfish and greedy ends, driven by restlessness and 11  \fdesire. 13 When tamas is dominant a person lives in darkness – slothful, confused, and easily infatuated. Those dying in the state of sattva attain the pure worlds of the wise. 15 Those dying in rajas are reborn among people driven by work. But those who die in tamas are conceived in the wombs of the ignorant. 14  The fruit of good deeds is pure and sattvic. The fruit of rajas is suffering. The fruit of tamas is ignorance and insensitivity. 16  From sattva comes understanding; from rajas, greed. But the outcome of tamas is confusion, infatuation, and ignorance. 17  Those who live in sattva go upwards; those in rajas remain where they are. But those immersed in tamas sink downwards. 18  The wise see clearly that all action is the work of the gunas. Knowing that which is above the gunas, they enter into union with me. 19  Going beyond the three gunas which form the body, they leave behind the cycle of birth and death, decrepitude and sorrow, and attain to immortality. 20  ARJUNA  What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the gunas, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the gunas’ hold? 21  KRISHNA  They are unmoved by the harmony of sattva, the activity of rajas, or the delusion of tamas. They feel no aversion when these forces are active, nor do they crave for them when these forces subside. 22  They remain impartial, undisturbed by the actions of the gunas. Knowing that it is the gunas which act, they abide within 23  \fthemselves and do not vacillate. Established within themselves, they are equal in pleasure and pain, praise and blame, kindness and unkindness. Clay, a rock, and gold are the same to them. 25 Alike in honor and dishonor, alike to friend and foe, they have given up every selfish pursuit. Such are those who have gone beyond the gunas. 24  By serving me with steadfast love, a man or woman goes beyond the gunas. Such a one is fit for union with Brahman. 27 For I am the support of Brahman, the eternal, the unchanging, the deathless, the everlasting dharma, the source of all joy. 26  \fChapter Fifteen  The Supreme Self This is a difficult chapter, for it deals essentially with questions of theology and ultimate mystical experience. Krishna reveals that he transcends not only the world of matter but also the immortal Atman that dwells as the conscious “knower” within all beings. Krishna has said that he is the Atman; but the paradox is that he also transcends the Atman. In this highest aspect Krishna is Ishvara, the cosmic Lord, who abides in his own mystery. The liberated Self enjoys union with Krishna and lives in Krishna’s highest home. But the Self does not become Krishna: the immortal soul, even when liberated from its mortal journeying, does not become God. The chapter opens with the image of an upside-down tree, a world-tree rooted in Brahman which branches out into a manifold creation in this realm below. This is said to be an ashvattha or pipal tree, a kind of fig. Like the banyan, it sends out roots into the air, spreading above and below. In this chapter about Krishna’s most exalted nature, it is appropriate that his “home,” the highest goal of all, is described. It is an abode of light and eternal life. By its very nature, it is beyond the description of human language. Verse 4 uses an elemental and ancient word for the ultimate reality that defies all description, all human thought: Tat, which means simply “that” or “it.” Here the Gita personalizes Tat to the extent of giving It a home: avyayam padam, the immortal home, the eternal goal. Pada also means foot or step, and it is of interest here to recall a myth from the Vedas. At the beginning of time Vishnu took three steps that measured out the entire cosmos. The third and highest step became a heavenly world, the realm of the blessed. In the Rig Veda (I.154.5), the poet longs to find himself in this home of the god: May I go to his blessed world Where those who love the gods rejoice; For there, truly, is the company of the far-stepping god, A fountain of honey in the highest step of Vishnu.  \fThe Gita describes Krishna’s home as a realm of light beyond the light of the sun (15:6). Here we might compare the Gita with the Katha Upanishad (5:15): There shines not the sun, neither moon nor star, Nor flash of lightning, nor fire lit on earth. The Self is the light reflected by all. He shining, everything shines after him. Even here, though, we are reminded that Krishna lives not just in this highest realm but also in the world below, where both darkness and light coexist. In his divine mystery he sends fragments of himself to become the inner Self in each creature. In this sense the Self enters the body at conception, dwells in the body, and then departs at death. Krishna is the prana – the breath or vitality – of the body. The Upanishads speak of five pranas; here the Gita mentions the two most prominent: the prana by which we breathe and the prana that digests food. –D.M.  \f15: The Supreme Self KRISHNA  Sages speak of the immutable ashvattha tree, with its taproot above and its branches below. On this tree grow the scriptures; seeing their source, one knows their essence. 1  Nourished by the gunas, the limbs of this tree spread above and below. Sense objects grow on the limbs as buds; the roots hanging down bind us to action in this world. 2  The true form of this tree – its essence, beginning, and end – is not perceived on this earth. Cut down this strong-rooted tree with the sharp ax of detachment; 4 then find the path which does not come back again. Seek That, the First Cause, from which the universe came long ago. 3  Not deluded by pride, free from selfish attachment and selfish desire, beyond the duality of pleasure and pain, ever aware of the Self, the wise go forward to that eternal goal. 6 Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire can add to that light. This is my supreme abode, and those who enter there do not return to separate existence. 5  An eternal part of me enters into the world, assuming the powers of action and perception and a mind made of prakriti. 8 When the divine Self enters and leaves a body, it takes these along as the wind carries a scent from place to place. 9 Using the mind, ears, eyes, nose, and the senses of taste and touch, the Self enjoys sense objects. 7  \fThe deluded do not see the Self when it leaves the body or when it dwells within it. They do not see the Self enjoying sense objects or acting through the gunas. But they who have the eye of wisdom see. 10  Those who strive resolutely on the path of yoga see the Self within. The thoughtless, who strive imperfectly, do not. 11  The brightness of the sun, which lights up the world, the brightness of the moon and of fire – these are my glory. 13 With a drop of my energy I enter the earth and support all creatures. Through the moon, the vessel of life-giving fluid, I nourish all plants. 14 I enter breathing creatures and dwell within as the lifegiving breath. I am the fire in the stomach which digests all food. 12  Entering into every heart, I give the power to remember and understand; it is I again who take that power away. All the scriptures lead to me; I am their author and their wisdom. 15  In this world there are two orders of being: the perishable, separate creature and the changeless spirit. 17 But beyond these there is another, the supreme Self, the eternal Lord, who enters into the entire cosmos and supports it from within. 16  I am that supreme Self, praised by the scriptures as beyond the changing and the changeless. 19 Those who see in me that supreme Self see truly. They have found the source of all wisdom, Arjuna, and they worship me with all their heart. 18  I have shared this profound truth with you, Arjuna. Those who understand it will attain wisdom; they will have done that which has to be done. 20  \fChapter Sixteen  Two Paths In this most unusual chapter, the Gita departs from a lofty view of human nature and describes two opposing forces. The higher tendency, the divine, leads to increasing happiness in the course of the soul’s evolution, and eventually to its liberation; but there is also a downward current leading to suffering and enslavement of the spirit. This chapter is unusual in giving equal, if not in fact more, attention to this dark side of human nature. Here we get a detailed description of the divine qualities that liberate and the “demonic” qualities that enslave (16:5). In a rare somber tone, Krishna describes the sinful person, the individual of a demonic kind – and it seems he knows what he is talking about. But first he assures Arjuna that he is of the divine type, so he shouldn’t be alarmed. The “demonic” personality is basically atheistic. For such people life does not originate in God or a divine reality but is grounded in biology, in sexual desire. Taking a low view of human nature, such people cause suffering to themselves as well as others. They are arrogant and have many insatiable selfish desires, and they do not hesitate to do anything that will get them what they want. Krishna grants that they may attain their desires, enjoying wealth and power, but their destination is hell – a hell of their own making, often in this very life, as their karma bears fruit. One of the least likable characteristics of “demonic” personalities is their sense of self-importance. They like to give gifts ostentatiously and offer ritual sacrifices; this legitimizes their wealth and makes them feel respectable and esteemed. They like being generous if it will make them look good. Krishna does not disguise his aversion to cruel people. He tells Arjuna that he arranges for them to be born again and again in a harsh world. Such souls cannot seem to purify their sinful hearts; repeating the same selfish ways, they sink lower and lower. This is a bleak picture, which the Gita dwells on only in this chapter. But even here, amidst the gloom, Krishna will not say that such a soul is eternally damned. It may be that such a sinful creature is condemned to birth after birth in harsh, unfavorable  \fcircumstances, sinking into more and more hellish states of mind; but the cycle goes on, the choice to change direction is always open, and the Atman itself can never be stained. Lust, anger, and greed are the three doors to hell that Arjuna must at all costs not enter. The person who enters will not only fail to reach life’s final goal, but will not achieve any measure of lasting happiness and prosperity. In Sanskrit this chapter is called the “Way of Divine and Demonic Destinies.” The words deva, god, and asura, demon, are not to be taken too literally here. The Hindu scriptures often tell stories of the battles between the gods and the demons; thus they dramatize the struggle between good and evil in the world. No divine character from Hindu myth escapes a challenge from some demon. Usually the god or goddess is victorious; but often the demon will win a battle or two, though not the final victory. Krishna has a long battle record, celebrated by epithets like Madhusudana, “slayer of the demon Madhu.” Rama, another incarnation of Vishnu, had to confront and kill Ravana. The stories go on. The gods never seem to rest for long: there is always a new challenge to their authority, a new source of malignant evil to be destroyed. The Mahabharata and the Gita do not dwell on these mythical battles. Here the interest is more frankly human, and when Krishna discusses the “divine” and “demonic” qualities, he speaks not of gods and demons but of human good and evil. –D.M.  \f16: Two Paths KRISHNA  Be fearless and pure; never waver in your determination or your dedication to the spiritual life. Give freely. Be self-controlled, sincere, truthful, loving, and full of the desire to serve. Realize the truth of the scriptures; learn to be detached and to take joy in renunciation. 2 Do not get angry or harm any living creature, but be compassionate and gentle; show good will to all. 3 Cultivate vigor, patience, will, purity; avoid malice and pride. Then, Arjuna, you will achieve your divine destiny. 1  Other qualities, Arjuna, make a person more and more inhuman: hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty, ignorance. 4  The divine qualities lead to freedom; the demonic, to bondage. But do not grieve, Arjuna; you were born with divine attributes. 5  Some people have divine tendencies, others demonic. I have described the divine at length, Arjuna; now listen while I describe the demonic. 6  The demonic do things they should avoid and avoid the things they should do. They have no sense of uprightness, purity, or truth. 7  “There is no God,” they say, “no truth, no spiritual law, no moral order. The basis of life is sex; what else can it be?” 9 Holding such distorted views, possessing scant discrimination, they become enemies of the world, causing suffering and destruction. 8  \fHypocritical, proud, and arrogant, living in delusion and clinging to deluded ideas, insatiable in their desires, they pursue their unclean ends. 11 Although burdened with fears that end only with death, they still maintain with complete assurance, “Gratification of lust is the highest that life can offer.” 10  Bound on all sides by scheming and anxiety, driven by anger and greed, they amass by any means they can a hoard of money for the satisfaction of their cravings. 12  “I got this today,” they say; “tomorrow I shall get that. This wealth is mine, and that will be mine too. 14 I have destroyed my enemies. I shall destroy others too! Am I not like God? I enjoy what I want. I am successful. I am powerful. I am happy. 15 I am rich and well-born. Who is equal to me? I will perform sacrifices and give gifts, and rejoice in my own generosity.” This is how they go on, deluded by ignorance. 16 Bound by their greed and entangled in a web of delusion, whirled about by a fragmented mind, they fall into a dark hell. 13  Self-important, obstinate, swept away by the pride of wealth, they ostentatiously perform sacrifices without any regard for their purpose. 18 Egotistical, violent, arrogant, lustful, angry, envious of everyone, they abuse my presence within their own bodies and in the bodies of others. 17  Life after life I cast those who are malicious, hateful, cruel, and degraded into the wombs of those with similar demonic natures. 20 Birth after birth they find themselves with demonic tendencies. Degraded in this way, Arjuna, they fail to reach me and fall lower still. 19  There are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and greed. Renounce these three. 22 Those who escape from these three gates of darkness, Arjuna, seek what is best and attain life’s supreme goal. 23 Others disregard the teachings of the scriptures. Driven by selfish desire, they miss the goal of life, miss even happiness and success. 21  \fTherefore let the scriptures be your guide in what to do and what not to do. Understand their teachings; then act in accordance with them. 24  \fChapter Seventeen  The Power of Faith At the end of the last chapter, Krishna told Arjuna to look to the scriptures to guide his actions, so that he can avoid the lower road that leads backwards to a less evolved state. Now Arjuna wants to know about those who do not follow the orthodox way set down in the scriptures, but who nevertheless offer some kind of worship with faith in their hearts. In reply Krishna goes into greater detail about the three gunas – sattva, rajas, and tamas. He also stresses the importance of shraddha or faith. This is a difficult word. “Faith” is not an adequate translation, and the etymology of the word is obscure; it probably has an underlying meaning of “what is held in the heart.” We might say that our shraddha is the sum total of our values, what we really hold to be important in our lives. Every human being, Krishna says, is shraddhamaya,“made up of faith” – as the Bible puts it, as we think in our heart, so we are. Here, as elsewhere in the Gita, shraddha is a positive quality. It is good to have faith; yet faith can be of different kinds, different qualities. Sattvic faith is the most evolved, the most pure. Rajasic faith is dynamic, evolving, yet tainted with selfish motives. Tamasic faith goes astray in a spiritual desert. To illustrate this, Krishna tells Arjuna that sattvic people worship the devas – the gods of heaven, of light. The rajasic worship yakshas and rakshasas. The yakshas are servants of the god of wealth; rakshasas are powerful, fearsome spirits driven by the lust for power and pleasure. Finally, tamasic people worship the spirits of the dead and ghosts. In a practical digression, Krishna describes the different kinds of food liked by the sattvic, the rajasic, and the tamasic. Then he applies the three gunas to the act of worship and sacrifice or selfless service (yajna). Verses 14–16 turn to the important question of tapas or sadhana, the disciplines undergone for the sake of spiritual growth. The Gita holds that no lasting progress is possible on the spiritual path without self-discipline. The root of the word tapas is tap, to be hot or to suffer pain; and in fact tapas can also mean heat or suffering. When certain spiritual practices are mastered, they create a feeling of heat in the body, which is a sign of  \fincreased spiritual potency. Tapas also refers to the power gained through spiritual austerity. Krishna dispels the mistaken belief that tapas means mortifying or torturing the body, and points out that spiritual disciplines can be sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. The sattvic kind of tapas is offered for a truly spiritual goal; rajasic tapas is performed to gain a selfish end, probably the admiration of others. Deluded by tamas, a person will undergo painful, foolish practices to try to gain power over, or even to injure, others. Changing course for a moment, Krishna discusses the mantram Om Tat Sat. Om is the most ancient of Hindu mantrams; it is the sacred syllable that is Brahman, the cosmic sound heard in the depths of meditation. Tat is “That,” the supreme reality beyond what language can describe or thought can think. And sat means both “that which is” and “that which is good.” The mantram Om Tat Sat affirms that only the good really exists; the opposite word, asat, implies that evil is transient and therefore is not ultimately real. The last verse concludes that no act or intention can add to spiritual growth if it is “faithless.” An act done without shraddha is asat, unreal; it cannot have meaning either in this world or the next. –D.M.  \f17: The Power of Faith ARJUNA  O Krishna, what is the state of those who disregard the scriptures but still worship with faith? Do they act from sattva, rajas, or tamas? 1  KRISHNA  Every creature is born with faith of some kind, either sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. Listen, and I will describe each to you. 2  Our faith conforms to our nature, Arjuna. Human nature is made of faith. A person is what his shraddha is. 3  Those who are sattvic worship the forms of God; those who are rajasic worship power and wealth. Those who are tamasic worship spirits and ghosts. 5 Some invent harsh penances. Motivated by hypocrisy and egotism, 6 they torture their innocent bodies and me who dwells within. Blinded by their strength and passion, they act and think like demons. 4  The three kinds of faith express themselves in the habits of those who hold them: in the food they like, the work they do, the disciplines they practice, the gifts they give. Listen, and I will describe their different ways. 7  Sattvic people enjoy food that is mild, tasty, substantial, agreeable, and nourishing, food that promotes health, strength, cheerfulness, and longevity. 9 Rajasic people like food that is salty or bitter, hot, sour, or spicy – food that promotes pain, discomfort, and disease. 10 8  \fTamasic people like overcooked, stale, leftover, and impure food, food that has lost its taste and nutritional value. The sattvic perform sacrifices with their entire mind fixed on the purpose of the sacrifice. Without thought of reward, they follow the teachings of the scriptures. 12 The rajasic perform sacrifices for the sake of show and the good it will bring them. 13 The tamasic perform sacrifices ignoring both the letter and the spirit. They omit the proper prayers, the proper offerings, the proper food, and the proper faith. 11  To offer service to the gods, to the good, to the wise, and to your spiritual teacher; purity, honesty, continence, and nonviolence: these are the disciplines of the body. 15 To offer soothing words, to speak truly, kindly, and helpfully, and to study the scriptures: these are the disciplines of speech. 16 Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind. 14  When these three levels of self-discipline are practiced without attachment to the results, but in a spirit of great faith, the sages call this practice sattvic. 18 Disciplines practiced in order to gain respect, honor, or admiration are rajasic; they are undependable and transitory in their effects. 19 Disciplines practiced to gain power over others, or in the confused belief that to torture oneself is spiritual, are tamasic. 17  Giving simply because it is right to give, without thought of return, at a proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy person, is sattvic giving. 21 Giving with regrets or in the expectation of receiving some favor or of getting something in return is rajasic. 22 Giving at an inappropriate time, in inappropriate circumstances, and to an unworthy person, without affection or respect, is tamasic. 20  Om Tat Sat: these three words represent Brahman, from which come priests and scriptures and sacrifice. 24 Those who follow the Vedas, therefore, always repeat the word Om when offering sacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, or giving gifts. 25 Those seeking liberation and not any personal benefit add the word Tat 23  \fwhen performing these acts of worship, discipline, and charity. 26 Sat means “that which is”; it also indicates goodness. Therefore it is used to describe a worthy deed. To be steadfast in self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving is sat. To act in accordance with these three is sat as well. 28 But to engage in sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving without good faith is asat, without worth or goodness, either in this life or in the next. 27  \fChapter Eighteen  Freedom & Renunciation This final chapter of the Gita roams over many subjects, beginning with a discussion of the merits of renunciation versus the life of personally involved action. To begin with, Arjuna asks about two words commonly used for renunciation in Sanskrit, sannyasa and tyaga. Both words come from roots meaning to give up or abandon. Sannyasa acquired the specialized meaning of giving up ordinary life to live the austere, wandering life of a homeless pilgrim. A sannyasi is a monk: one who does not participate in family life and has withdrawn from society. In a sense, he has withdrawn from life. Krishna does not recommend this kind of renunciation. In fact, he says it is impossible for anyone to “give up” in this way, for as long as we have a body, we have to do a certain amount of work just to maintain it. Krishna does not advise dropping out of life, and the Gita is primarily aimed at people who live “in the world” yet desire genuine spiritual fulfillment. The kind of renunciation Krishna recommends is tyaga, where it is not activity but selfish desire for the rewards of action – of work, of life – that is to be renounced. Arjuna is advised to fulfill all his responsibilities, but without a selfish motive. In particular, he should not give up the three great virtuous works – sacrifice, giving, and spiritual disciplines. Having made plain to Arjuna that renunciation is essential, Krishna goes on to explain that renunciation can be of three kinds, depending upon the guna that dominates the individual’s personality. As may be expected, rajasic and tamasic renunciation leave something to be desired. Many times Krishna has said that renunciation of the fruits of work is essential. Perhaps the verse in chapter 2 said it best – that we have control over our work and actions, but we have no command of the results. The word karma-phala-tyaga appears again and again, and the literal translation is “renunciation of the fruits of action.” In this final chapter, literally “The Freedom [moksha] That Comes from Renunciation,” Krishna sums up his teaching that in work, in life, one must not be driven by a selfish desire for any kind of reward, for such compulsive work can only stunt full spiritual development. In addition, Krishna points out, when we act out of selfish  \fattachment, we must fully partake of the result, the karma, of every thought, word, and deed; and although these results may be what was desired, they may also be something not desired at all, or a little of both (18:12). In this life we can never be sure that things will turn out as planned. In verse 13 the Sankhya philosophy is again mentioned. Scholars believe that at the time the Gita was composed the Sankhya school was at an early stage of development, yet even here we see the characteristic method of thorough categorizing. Using the Sankhya categories of the three gunas, the Gita goes on to give more detail about work, which is of three kinds – sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Similarly, the doer of the work is shown to be dominated by one of these all-pervasive qualities. In a very interesting passage Krishna talks of three kinds of happiness – a practical application of the abstract theories of Sankhya (18:36–39). Pursuing the world of work, and how it contributes to spiritual growth, the Gita gives a short explanation of caste in this chapter. The Gita is not especially interested in caste – the social hierarchy of Hindu society – but we do find a short explanation here. The sannyasi, the renouncing monk, has left society and therefore belongs to no caste, but Krishna does not point out that course to Arjuna. Rather, he wants Arjuna to lead an active life. Krishna tells him that devotion to his own duty is best. It is better to do one’s own work, even if imperfectly, than to try to take on some other work. The work proper to each of the four castes is then described. In general, the Gita takes a liberal view of caste, and it would be wrong to interpret this chapter as supporting a rigid caste system. The final part of this chapter, verses 50 and following, give a picture of the person who has attained siddhi– success or perfection – in the spiritual life and who goes on to union with Brahman. In verse 61 Krishna returns to a favorite topic – the Lord dwelling in the hearts of all beings. But here he adds a startling revelation: the Lord dwells in all, yet he “whirls them around” through maya as if they were toys mounted on a machine. Having jarred Arjuna with this amazing image, Krishna reassures him that he can escape from the machine, the wheel of time, through devotion to God. If he wholeheartedly takes refuge in the Lord within, then through Krishna’s grace he will find peace. As his all but final word, Krishna reminds Arjuna that he holds him very dear. Through devotion, Arjuna will be able to find his way, and he should not forget that Krishna feels deep love for him.  \fThe relationship between the teacher and student is given a parting word, partially of warning. Krishna does not want these profound truths told to anyone who is not ready. Anyone lacking devotion or self-control, who does not want to hear spiritual instruction or who scoffs at it, should not be accepted as a student. The sacred act of giving spiritual instruction cannot be undertaken lightly. It is the highest work, and the man or woman who does it is most dear to Krishna. Finally, Krishna asks Arjuna if he has understood. Arjuna says yes, his conflicts are over; he is ready to follow Krishna’s instructions. This concludes the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna and the instruction of the Gita proper. Sanjaya, who has been narrating the poem to blind king Dhritarashtra, adds a few final verses of benediction. He has “seen” this dialogue through his mystic vision, granted by the grace of Vyasa. Just recalling this wonderful conversation makes his hair stand on end in ecstasy, and when he remembers Krishna’s wonderful beauty, his joy is boundless. –D.M.  \f18: Freedom & Renunciation ARJUNA  O Krishna, destroyer of evil, please explain to me sannyasa and tyaga and how one kind of renunciation differs from another. 1  KRISHNA  To refrain from selfish acts is one kind of renunciation, called sannyasa; to renounce the fruit of action is another, called tyaga. 2  Among the wise, some say that all action should be renounced as evil. Others say that certain kinds of action – self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline – should be continued. 4 Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain three kinds of tyaga and my conclusions concerning them. 3  Self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline should not be renounced, for they purify the thoughtful. 6 Yet even these, Arjuna, should be performed without desire for selfish rewards. This is essential. 5  To renounce one’s responsibilities is not fitting. The wise call such deluded renunciation tamasic. 8 To avoid action from fear of difficulty or physical discomfort is rajasic. There is no reward in such renunciation. 9 But to fulfill your responsibilities knowing that they are obligatory, while at the same time desiring nothing for yourself – this is sattvic renunciation. 10 Those endowed with sattva clearly understand the meaning of renunciation and do not waver. They are not intimidated by unpleasant work, nor do they seek a job because it is pleasant. 7  \fAs long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward. 12 Those who are attached to personal reward will reap the consequences of their actions: some pleasant, some unpleasant, some mixed. But those who renounce every desire for personal reward go beyond the reach of karma. 11  Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain the five elements necessary for the accomplishment of every action, as taught by the wisdom of Sankhya. 14 The body, the means, the ego, the performance of the act, and the divine will: 15 these are the five factors in all actions, right or wrong, in thought, word, or deed. 13  Those who do not understand this think of themselves as separate agents. With their crude intellects they fail to see the truth. 17 The person who is free from ego, who has attained purity of heart, though he slays these people, he does not slay and is not bound by his action. 16  Knowledge, the thing to be known, and the knower: these three promote action. The means, the act itself, and the doer: these three are the totality of action. 19 Knowledge, action, and the doer can be described according to the gunas. Listen, and I will explain their distinctions to you. 18  Sattvic knowledge sees the one indestructible Being in all beings, the unity underlying the multiplicity of creation. 21 Rajasic knowledge sees all things and creatures as separate and distinct. 22 Tamasic knowledge, lacking any sense of perspective, sees one small part and mistakes it for the whole. 20  Work performed to fulfill one’s obligations, without thought of personal reward or of whether the job is pleasant or unpleasant, is sattvic. 24 Work prompted by selfish desire or self-will, full of stress, is rajasic. 25 Work that is undertaken blindly, without any consideration of consequences, waste, injury to others, or one’s own capacities, is tamasic. 23  \fSattvic workers are free from egotism and selfish attachments, full of enthusiasm and fortitude in success and failure alike. 27 Rajasic workers have strong personal desires and crave rewards for their actions. Covetous, impure, and destructive, they are easily swept away by fortune, good or bad. 28 Tamasic workers are undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, dishonest, and lazy. They are easily depressed and prone to procrastination. 26  Listen, Arjuna, as I describe the three types of understanding and will. 29  To know when to act and when to refrain from action, what is right action and what is wrong, what brings security and what insecurity, what brings freedom and what bondage: these are the signs of a sattvic intellect. 30  The rajasic intellect confuses right and wrong actions, and cannot distinguish what is to be done from what should not be done. 32 The tamasic intellect is shrouded in darkness, utterly reversing right and wrong wherever it turns. 31  The sattvic will, developed through meditation, keeps prana, mind, and senses in vital harmony. 34 The rajasic will, conditioned by selfish desire, pursues wealth, pleasure, and respectability. 35 The tamasic will shows itself in obstinate ignorance, sloth, fear, grief, depression, and conceit. 33  Now listen, Arjuna: there are also three kinds of happiness. By sustained effort, one comes to the end of sorrow. 37 That which seems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end – this is the joy of sattva, born of a mind at peace with itself. 38 Pleasure from the senses seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter as poison in the end. This is the kind of happiness that comes to the rajasic. 39 Those who are tamasic draw their pleasures from sleep, indolence, and intoxication. Both in the beginning and in the end, this happiness is a delusion. 36  \fNo creature, whether born on earth or among the gods in heaven, is free from the conditioning of the three gunas. 41 The different responsibilities found in the social order – distinguishing brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra – have their roots in this conditioning. 40  The responsibilities to which brahmins are born, based on their nature, are self-control, tranquility, purity of heart, patience, humility, learning, austerity, wisdom, and faith. 42  The qualities of kshatriyas, based on their nature, are courage, strength, fortitude, dexterity, generosity, leadership, and the firm resolve never to retreat from battle. 44 The occupations suitable for a vaishya are agriculture, dairying, and trade. The proper work of a shudra is service. 43  By devotion to one’s own particular duty, everyone can attain perfection. Let me tell you how. 46 By performing one’s own work, one worships the Creator who dwells in every creature. Such worship brings that person to fulfillment. 45  It is better to perform one’s own duties imperfectly than to master the duties of another. By fulfilling the obligations he is born with, a person never comes to grief. 48 No one should abandon duties because he sees defects in them. Every action, every activity, is surrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke. 47  One who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action. 50 Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom. 49  Unerring in discrimination, sovereign of the senses and passions, free from the clamor of likes and dislikes, 52 such a one leads a simple, self-reliant life based on meditation, controlling speech, body, and mind. 51  \fFree from self-will, aggressiveness, arrogance, anger, and the lust to possess people or things, they are at peace with themselves and others and enter into the unitive state. 54 United with Brahman, ever joyful, beyond the reach of desire and sorrow, they have equal regard for every living creature and attain supreme devotion to me. 55 By loving me they come to know me truly; then they know my glory and enter into my boundless being. 56 All their acts are performed in my service, and through my grace they win eternal life. 53  Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always. 58 Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. 57  If you egotistically say, “I will not fight this battle,” your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. 60 Your own karma, born of your own nature, will drive you to do even that which you do not wish to do, because of your delusion. 59  The Lord dwells in the hearts of all creatures and whirls them round upon the wheel of maya. 62 Run to him for refuge with all your strength, and peace profound will be yours through his grace. 61  I give you these precious words of wisdom; reflect on them and then do as you choose. 64 These are the last words I shall speak to you, dear one, for your spiritual fulfillment. You are very dear to me. 63  Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me. 66 Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve. 65  Do not share this wisdom with anyone who lacks in devotion or self-control, lacks the desire to learn, or scoffs at me. 68 Those who teach this supreme mystery of the Gita to all who love me perform 67  \fthe greatest act of love; they will come to me without doubt. 69 No one can render me more devoted service; no one on earth can be more dear to me. Those who meditate on these holy words worship me with wisdom and devotion. 71 Even those who listen to them with faith, free from doubts, will find a happier world where good people dwell. 70  Have you listened with attention? Are you now free from your doubts and confusion? 72  ARJUNA  You have dispelled my doubts and delusions, and I understand through your grace. My faith is firm now, and I will do your will. 73  SANJAYA  This is the dialogue I heard between Krishna, the son of Vasudeva, and Arjuna, the great-hearted son of Pritha. The wonder of it makes my hair stand on end! 75 Through Vyasa’s grace, I have heard the supreme secret of spiritual union directly from the Lord of Yoga, Krishna himself. 74  Whenever I remember these wonderful, holy words between Krishna and Arjuna, I am filled with joy. 77 And when I remember the breathtaking form of Krishna, I am filled with wonder and my joy overflows. 76  Wherever the divine Krishna and the mighty Arjuna are, there will be prosperity, victory, happiness, and sound judgment. Of this I am sure! 78  \fNotes CHAPTER ONE  1 The phrase “on the field of dharma” (dharma-kshetre) gives a hint that the battle is to be an allegorical one, a fight of dharma, justice, against adharma, evil. The battle takes place not only at Kurukshetra, the “field of the Kurus,” but also on the elusive “field of dharma,” the spiritual realm where all moral struggles are waged. 40–44 These verses are particularly difficult to translate, because they revolve around the complex word dharma: law, justice, or simply something’s inner nature. To try to capture the word in English we might say “God’s law” or “eternal truth.” Dharma is divinely given; it is the force that holds things together in a unity, the center that must hold if all is to go well. The opposite of dharma is adharma: evil, injustice, chaos. In these verses Arjuna gives expression to his fears of a coming chaos, an evil world where good people will be confused and violated. “Sense of unity” here translates dharma; the phrase “loses its sense of unity” would be more literally translated as “is overcome by adharma.” The translation speaks in a general way of the chaos that overcomes society when dharma is weak – when ancient spiritual truths are ignored. Thus varna-samkara, literally “confusion of caste,” is more meaningful as “society [is] plunged into chaos.” The subject here is not the observance of caste restrictions, but the essential cohesion of the social fabric. 42 The Sanskrit refers to the ancient pinda rites that offer homage to dead ancestors. These rites maintained the traditions of the family by respecting and worshipping those who had gone before. Again, the rather liberal rendering “the spiritual evolution begun by our ancestors” seems preferable to a narrower translation. CHAPTER TWO  \f17 Tat, “that,” is an ancient name for Brahman, the supreme reality. Brahman is neither masculine nor feminine; in fact, it has no attributes at all. It is impossible to describe Brahman in words, so it is simply pointed to: tat. 72 The state of immortality is brahma-nirvana, “the nirvana that is Brahman.” This is the state of release or liberation, union with the divine ground of existence. The word nirvana comes from the Sanskrit root va “to blow” with the prefix nir “out”; it means “to extinguish,” as a fire is said to be “blown out.” Thus it indicates the extinction of the old, limited personality. By adding the word brahman, complete union with the universal Godhead is indicated. Brahma-nirvana then means the mystic state of extinction of self in the union with God. Nirvana is a Buddhist term as well. Some misconceptions are unfortunately current about this rather esoteric concept. Nirvana is wrongly presented as a kind of empty nothingness, even a spiritual death. We get exactly the opposite impression if we approach the Hindus and Buddhists themselves. It is true there is much talk of extinguishing the petty ego and going beyond self-will – the mask that hides the creative, wise, loving Self underneath. This “death” of the old person to make way for the new is one purpose of spiritual disciplines. It can be painful, but the death of the old does not lead to annihilation but to a spiritual rebirth. CHAPTER THREE  9 Here and later yajna is translated as “selfless work” or “selfless service.” The literal meaning is sacrifice: essentially, self-sacrifice, giving up something one greatly values for the sake of a higher purpose. Some translators give a very narrow translation of yajna as a ritualistic sacrifice, but this is inaccurate. 39 Kama can be translated as selfish desire or pleasure, and often carries a connotation of sensual desire or sexual passion. It means essentially a personal desire for ease or pleasure, not “desire” of a more altruistic kind. CHAPTER FOUR  \f37 This is a well-known verse. The meanings of karma are complex, but the verse is widely taken to mean that true knowledge destroys the effects of past errors, which generate further karma. When consciousness is unified and illumined, one is released from the bondage of karma. CHAPTER FIVE  6 Yoga has many meanings in the Gita. Here yoga is translated as “action” and “selfless service” because a contrast is being made between Sankhya and yoga: that is, between philosophical explanation and the actual practice of the spiritual life. 9 The word for “senses” in Sanskrit is indriya, literally “faculty” or “power.” The indriyas are not only the five faculties of perception (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting) but also those of action, whose organs are the hands, the feet, the tongue, and the organs of excretion and reproduction. 13 “The city of nine gates” is the body. The gates are the two eyes, the two nostrils, the two ears, the mouth, and the organs of excretion and reproduction. In some lists these gates are expanded to eleven by adding the navel and the brahmarandhra or sagittal suture, the opening at the top of the skull. 27–28 The area “of spiritual consciousness” between the eyebrows is one of the seven centers of awareness or chakras described in yoga literature. These seven chakras, though not physical, are said to lie along a channel for awakened spiritual energy (kundalini) that corresponds with the spine; the chakras are located at the level of the anus, sex organs, stomach, heart, throat, eyebrows, and the top of the head. Kundalini circulates among these centers, but it is usually confined to the lowest three chakras, corresponding to the main preoccupations of life on the physical level. In yogic concentration the vital energy (kundalini) rises; samadhi is said to take place when it reaches the chakras at the brow or head. CHAPTER SIX  \f11 This describes the traditional seat used for meditation. The Gita is not concerned with the outer forms of the spiritual life, but here we do get a mention of the grass and deerskin used by the ancient sages. Perhaps the point is that they used what was available in their forest retreats, and that the seat should be what Patanjali calls sukhasana: comfortable enough to forget about your body. 14 “All actions dedicated to Brahman” is a literal translation of the Sanskrit word brahmacharya, a life of self-control and sense restraint. CHAPTER SEVEN  16 Artharthi has given translators some difficulties. “Those who desire to achieve their purpose” captures the basic meaning of the word. Artha is goal or purpose; the second word of the compound, arthi, means “one who has a goal.” So artharthi probably refers to those who take to the spiritual life with a particular purpose in view. Artha also means wealth or worldly goods, but to translate this phrase as “those who desire wealth” would go against the entire tenor of the Gita. 23 “The gods” here are the devas, the lower, celestial deities such as Indra. 30 These obscure terms (adhibhuta, adhidaiva, and adhiyajna) are taken up in the next chapter. CHAPTER EIGHT  6 Whatever is the content of the mind at the moment of death determines the direction of the soul’s rebirth. The implication is that whatever has been the bedrock of consciousness during life will be remembered at the time of death and lead the soul on to fulfill that desire in the next life. 9–10 The eyebrow center is discussed in the note to 5:27–28. CHAPTER NINE  5 Yoga here means “mysterious power.” This is yet another meaning attached to the word yoga, for those who practiced yoga were  \fsometimes thought of as concealing within themselves extraordinary powers developed through their disciplines. The folklore of India relates many stories about mysterious yogis who have strange, divine powers. Krishna speaks here of his yoga aishvaram, his mysterious and majestic power. Ishvara means “lord” and aishvaram “lordly”: Krishna’s yoga is something he uses as Ishvara, the Lord of the world. Now he begins to show Arjuna something of the nature of the mystery. 17 Rig, Yajur, and Sama are the principal Vedas, the ancient scriptures that are Hinduism’s orthodox authority. 20–21 These verses repeat the idea that heaven itself is an impermanent state. After exhausting the store of their good karma, the blessed souls in heaven must be reborn on earth. Only the liberated soul, the one who has found union with Krishna or brahmanirvana, escapes the round of rebirth and death as a separate, mortal creature. CHAPTER TEN  This chapter contains many Sanskrit names, which are briefly identified in the glossary (see p. 279). 18 Amrita, “immortal,” comes from a “not” and mrita “mortal.” The Greek word ambrosia is cognate and has the same meanings: amrita is the ambrosia of the gods, the drink that makes them live forever, and in a general sense it means sweet or nectar-like. So the translation could also be “your words, which are like ambrosia.” 22 The mind (manas) is here taken to be one of the senses or indriyas of perception; for example, it is really with the mind rather than with the eye that we see. 33 The Sanskrit alphabet, too, begins with the letter a; perhaps this is why Krishna declares that among letters he is a, the first. Another possible reason is that a is the most frequent sound in Sanskrit. CHAPTER ELEVEN  \f14 Here Arjuna presses the palms of his hands together in the gesture called anjali, like the Western gesture of prayer. This is the usual form of respectful greeting in India, as well as being used in worship and prayer. 15 Brahma, the Creator (not to be confused with Brahman, the attributeless Godhead, which is beyond the Trinity of creation, preservation, and destruction) sits within a lotus that grows from the navel of Lord Vishnu. 17 Here Arjuna sees not his friend Krishna, but the Lord incarnate in Krishna: Vishnu, armed with his traditional weapons, a club (or mace) and a discus. Not mentioned in this verse are the two benign symbols he carries in his other hands, a conch and a lotus. CHAPTER TWELVE  1 Arjuna is asking which path is superior, that of knowledge (jnana yoga) or love (bhakti yoga). CHAPTER THIRTEEN  5 This is a list of all the twenty-four categories given in Sankhya philosophy to describe phenomena in the field of prakriti. CHAPTER FIFTEEN  1 The ashvattha is the sacred pipal tree, a kind of fig often grown in temple compounds in India. The idea of a “world tree” appears in many ancient cultures. Here the Gita uses the image of the tree as “upside down,” drawing on the fact that the pipal sends out aerial roots, making “branches above and below.” The image illustrates the phenomenal world, rooted in Brahman, complete unity, and branching out into the apparent diversity of life. 13 Rasatmaka soma is here translated as “life-giving fluid,” the nourishment of plants. In Hindu mythology it is the moon, sometimes called Soma, that nourishes plants, as the source of the life-giving nectar called Soma. In the Vedas, soma is an intoxicating, invigorating  \fdrink distilled from a plant grown high in the mountains and drunk by participants in a sacred ritual. Scholars have tried to discover what the soma plant might have been, but so far no conclusive identification has been made. Soma also appears as an important god in the Vedas. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  27–28 Sat means that which is real or true and that which is good; it derives from the Sanskrit verb as, to be, and is directly related to our English word is. It is noteworthy that this word sat links reality and goodness, reflecting the idea that good is eternal; it is merely covered from time to time by asat, evil, which is temporary and in that sense unreal. Asat is formed from sat by the addition of the prefix a “without,” very much the way English forms words like amoral. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN  1 Sannyasa and tyaga both mean renunciation, sannyasa from the root as “to cast aside” and tyaga from tyaj “to give up.” The distinction between these two is clarified in the introduction to this chapter. 14 “The divine will” is a translation of daivam, which comes from the word deva, “god.” Daivam is sometimes translated as “fate,” but this is inappropriate in the Gita, which is not at all fatalistic. The Gita does, however, allow a place for God’s will or Providence in the affairs of humankind – though of course the dominant force is usually karma, not daivam. 34 This verse uses the phrase dharma-kama-artha, “duty, pleasure, and wealth,” traditionally considered the three goals of ordinary human life. The fourth and highest goal is moksha, salvation. The rajasic personality, as this verse points out, pursues the first three worldly goals; moksha is ignored. 41 The Vedas establish the fourfold division of society into the classes of brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra – roughly priests and intellectuals; warriors and rulers; businessmen, farmers, and craftsmen; and workers and servants.  \f66 Dharma is not used here in the usual sense of law or inner nature, but in a rarer meaning: a thing’s attribute, condition, or conditioning. Usually dharma is used in this sense only in the plural, as here: thus dharma is divine law; dharmas are the innumerable beings, things, emotions and mental states that make up everyday existence as we experience it. Here, following the root meaning (dhri, to support or hold up), sarvadharman is translated as “all your supports,” in the sense of external props, conditioned dependencies. Another translation would be: “Cast off your dependency on everything external, Arjuna, and rely on the Self alone.”  \fGlossary This brief glossary is a guide to Sanskrit terms used in this volume. Words used once and explained in context are not included. As a rough guide, Sanskrit vowels may be pronounced as in Italian or Spanish. The combinations kh, gh, jh, th, dh, ph, and bh are always pronounced as the consonant plus a slight h sound: e.g., ph as in haphazard (not as in phone). Pronounce ch as in church; h as in home; g as in gold; j as in June except in the combination jn, which can be pronounced like gn in Italian compagna. The other consonants are approximately as in English. Every Sanskrit vowel has a short and a long form, the long pronounced for twice as long as the short. The diphthongs – e, ai, o, au – are also long. The Sanskrit alphabet has 48 characters, each representing a precisely defined sound. Scholars represent these characters in our Roman alphabet by adding marks to letters as necessary, creating a system of spelling that is precise but confusing to the general reader. For simplicity, these differentiating marks have been omitted in this e-book, but may be found in the printed edition. adharma “Not dharma.” Injustice, evil, anything which goes against moral laws. advaita Having no duality; the supreme Reality, which is the “One without a second.” The word advaita is especially used in Vedanta philosophy, which stresses the unity of the Self (Atman) and Brahman. ahamkara [aham “I”; kara “maker”] Self-will, separateness. ahimsa [a “not”; himsa “violence”] Nonviolence, doing no injury, wishing no harm. akasha Space, sky; the most subtle of the five elements. akshara The eternal; the syllable Om.

And the reason is clear. It is impossible to get to the heart of those classics unless you live them, and he did live them. My admiration of the man and his works is boundless.”– Huston Smith, The World’s Religions Each of these best-selling editions includes a detailed introduction explaining the historical and cultural background and core concepts of the scripture, with a glossary and notes. Other titles in this series:  The Dhammapada This collection of the Buddha’s teachings is permeated with all the power and practicality of one of the world’s most appealing spiritual guides. The Upanishads In these most ancient of Indian wisdom texts, illumined sages share flashes of insight, the results of many years of investigation into consciousness  \fitself. THE WISDOM OF INDIA Essence of the Bhagavad Gita A Contemporary Guide to Yoga, Meditation, and Indian Philosophy Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Easwaran saw the Gita as “not only magnificent literature but a sure guide to human affairs – one that could throw light on the problems I faced in my own times of crisis.” This book is Easwaran’s guide to the Gita, his distillation of its teachings and his answer to the questions: “What is the Gita really about? And what is its relevance for us today?” Essence of the Bhagavad Gita is a completely new publication based on talks that Easwaran gave to his close students towards the end of his life, after forty years of a teaching career in which he taught, studied, and applied the principles of the Gita with a passionate, contagious enthusiasm. As an ancient scripture, the Gita can be confusing for modern readers, so Easwaran highlights the main themes, explains the key concepts, and shares the verses he loves best, using his own translation from the original Sanskrit. Along the way, he uncovers the Gita’s startling insights into the problems threatening our civilization. Like the warrior-prince Arjuna, we must learn to make wise choices. In this modern, original interpretation Easwaran shows how the Gita points a way forward for us – both as individuals and in our global society today. Other titles in this series: Essence of the Upanishads Key to Indian Spirituality (Formerly titled Dialogue with Death) The Katha Upanishad, one of India’s classic wisdom texts, embraces all the key ideas of Indian spirituality within the context of a powerful mythic  \fquest. Set in the shadowy kingdom of Death, the Katha opens with the young hero, Nachiketa, seeking answers to the age-old questions: “What is the purpose of life? And what will happen to me after I die?” The King of Death emerges as the perfect spiritual guide, challenging, uncompromising, and direct. But the insights of the Katha, as with all the Upanishads, are scattered, hard to understand. Easwaran explains the core concepts and presents them systematically, illustrating them through everyday examples and analogies, as a way to explore deeper and deeper levels of personality. Taken this way, the Katha provides a comprehensive answer to the question “Who am I?” Essence of the Dhammapada (Forthcoming) ESSENTIAL EASWARAN LIBRARY THE BHAGAVAD GITA FOR DAILY LIVING This detailed commentary on the Bhagavad Gita in three volumes offers a unique combination of wisdom, warmth, and practical spirituality. Easwaran explains each verse, relates it to our modern lives through stories and anecdotes, and suggests small spiritual exercises that we can use to bring the Gita’s teachings into our own hearts. These volumes include the Devanagari (Sanskrit) script for each verse followed by Easwaran’s translation, a passage from the Gita selected and translated for passage meditation, a brief overview of Easwaran’s eightpoint program of passage meditation, a glossary, a guide to Sanskrit pronunciation, and a detailed index. Volume 1: The End of Sorrow (Chapters 1–6 of the Bhagavad Gita) Volume 2: Like a Thousand Suns (Chapters 7–12) Volume 3: To Love Is to Know Me (Chapters 13–18)  \fVolume 1 concentrates on the individual: the nature of our innermost Self, how we can discover this Self in the depths of our own consciousness, and how this discovery transforms our daily living. Volume 2 explores the indivisible unity governing all creation. Easwaran describes the steps we can take to realize this unity and to heal divisions within society and ourselves. Volume 3 is global in scope, but Easwaran’s emphasis is on what we can do as individuals. He explains how our everyday choices, taken all together, lead our society downwards to violence, or upwards to a wiser and more peaceful world. Passage Meditation Bringing the Deep Wisdom of the Heart into Daily Life In Easwaran’s universal method of passage meditation, you choose a spiritual text from the world’s great traditions that embodies your highest ideals. You memorize it, and then send it deep into consciousness through slow, sustained attention. With regular practice, the passages become lifelines, taking you to the source of wisdom deep within and then guiding you through all the challenges of daily life. Eknath Easwaran taught passage meditation to thousands of people for over forty years, including a course at the University of California. Meditation is supported by seven other points in Easwaran’s practical spiritual program, helping you to stay calm, kind, and focused throughout the day. Thoroughly tested, consistent and clear, this book gives you all you need to start meditating. The Mantram Handbook A Practical Guide to Choosing Your Mantram and Calming Your Mind A mantram (or mantra) is a short, powerful spiritual formula or prayer word from the world’s great traditions. Examples include Rama, Rama, used by  \fGandhi; My God and My All, used by Saint Francis of Assisi; and the Buddhist mantram, Om mani padme hum. Easwaran explains how to choose a mantram, and shows through stories and examples how it can be repeated silently anytime, anywhere, to help calm the mind and access our deepest wisdom. Repeat your chosen mantram when you are worried, angry, or caught in regrets, and the mantram will guide and comfort you like a true friend. God Makes the Rivers to Flow An Anthology of Sacred Poetry and Prose This classic anthology is Easwaran’s comprehensive collection of the wisest, most life-affirming, lyrical writings from the sacred literature of the world. The passages are supported by Easwaran’s writings on spiritual living, background notes, and guidelines for using these texts for inspiration, study, and for Easwaran’s own method of passage meditation.  BIOGRAPHY Eknath Easwaran (1910–1999) brings to this volume a rare combination of credentials: knowledge of Sanskrit, an intuitive understanding of his Hindu legacy, and a mastery of English. He was chairman of the English department at a major Indian university when he came to the United States on a Fulbright fellowship in 1959. A gifted teacher who lived for many years in the West, Easwaran explains the concepts underlying the classics of Indian spirituality in fresh, authoritative, and profoundly simple ways. Easwaran’s translations of the Indian spiritual classics (The Bhagavad Gita, The Upanishads, and The Dhammapada) are the best-selling editions in English.

It is the dead of winter and a fierce snowstorm rages outside, but a great fire fills the space within the hall with warmth and light. Now and then, a sparrow darts in for refuge from the weather. It appears as if from nowhere, flits about joyfully in the light, and then disappears again, and where it comes from and where it goes next in that stormy darkness, we do not know. Our lives are like that, suggests an old story in Bedes medieval history of England. We spend our days in the familiar world of our five senses, but what lies beyond that, if anything, we have no idea. Those sparrows are hints of something more outside  a vast world, perhaps, waiting to be explored. But most of us are happy to stay where we are. We may even be a bit afraid to venture into the unknown. What would be the point, we ask. Why should we leave the world we know? Yet there are always a few who are not content to spend their lives indoors. Simply knowing there is something unknown beyond their reach makes them acutely restless. They have to see what lies outside  if only, as George Mallory said of Everest, because its there. This is true of adventurers of every kind, but especially of those who seek to explore not mountains or jungles but consciousness itself: whose real drive, we might say, is not so much to know the unknown as to know the knower. Such men and women can be found in every age and every culture. While the rest of us stay put, they quietly slip out to see what lies beyond. Then, so far as we can tell, they disappear. We have no idea where they have gone; we cant even imagine. But every now and then, like friends who have run off to some exotic land, they send back reports: breathless messages describing fantastic adventures, rambling letters about a world beyond ordinary experience, urgent telegrams begging us to come and see.  \fLook at this view! Isnt it breathtaking? Wish you could see this. Wish you were here. The works in this set of translations  the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Dhammapada  are among the earliest and most universal of messages like these, sent to inform us that there is more to life than the everyday experience of our senses. The Upanishads are the oldest, so varied that we feel some unknown collectors must have tossed into a jumble all the photos, postcards, and letters from this world that they could find, without any regard for source or circumstance. Thrown together like this, they form a kind of ecstatic slide show  snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness taken at various times by different observers and dispatched with just the barest kind of explanation. But those who have traveled those heights will recognize the views: Oh, yes, thats Everest from the northwest  must be late spring. And here were south, in the full snows of winter. The Dhammapada, too, is a collection  traditionally, sayings of the Buddha, one of the very greatest of these explorers of consciousness. In this case the messages have been sorted, but not by a scheme that makes sense to us today. Instead of being grouped by theme or topic, they are gathered according to some dominant characteristic like a symbol or metaphor  flowers, birds, a river, the sky  that makes them easy to commit to memory. If the Upanishads are like slides, the Dhammapada seems more like a field guide. This is lore picked up by someone who knows every step of the way through these strange lands. He cant take us there, he explains, but he can show us the way: tell us what to look for, warn about missteps, advise us about detours, tell us what to avoid. Most important, he urges us that it is our destiny as human beings to make this journey ourselves. Everything else is secondary. And the third of these classics, the Bhagavad Gita, gives us a map and guidebook. It gives a systematic overview of the territory, shows various approaches to the summit with their benefits and pitfalls, offers recommendations, tells us what to pack and what to leave behind. More than either of the others, it gives the sense of a personal guide. It asks and answers the questions that you or I might ask  questions not about philosophy or mysticism, but about how to live effectively in a world of challenge and change. Of these three, it is the Gita that has been my own personal guidebook, just as it was Mahatma Gandhis.  \fThese three texts are very personal records of a landscape that is both real and universal. Their voices, passionately human, speak directly to you and me. They describe the topography of consciousness itself, which belongs as much to us today as to these largely anonymous seers thousands of years ago. If the landscape seems dark in the light of sense perception, they tell us, it has an illumination of its own, and once our eyes adjust we can see in what Western mystics call this divine dark and verify their descriptions for ourselves. And this world, they insist, is where we belong. This wider field of consciousness is our native land. We are not cabin-dwellers, born to a life cramped and confined; we are meant to explore, to seek, to push the limits of our potential as human beings. The world of the senses is just a base camp: we are meant to be as much at home in consciousness as in the world of physical reality. This is a message that thrills men and women in every age and culture. It is for such kindred spirits that these texts were originally composed, and it is for them in our own time that I undertook these translations, in the conviction that they deserve an audience today as much as ever. If these books speak to even a handful of such readers, they will have served their purpose.  \fIntroduction  The Bhagavad Gita Many years ago, when I was still a graduate student, I traveled by train from central India to Simla, then the summer seat of the British government in India. We had not been long out of Delhi when suddenly a chattering of voices disturbed my reverie. I asked the man next to me if something had happened. Kurukshetra! he replied. The next stop is Kurukshetra! I could understand the excitement. Kurukshetra, the field of the Kurus, is the setting for the climactic battle of the Mahabharata, the vastest epic in any world literature, on which virtually every Hindu child in India is raised. Its characters, removed in time by some three thousand years, are as familiar to us as our relatives. The temper of the story is utterly contemporary; I can imagine it unfolding in the nuclear age as easily as in the dawn of Indian history. The Mahabharata is literature at its greatest  in fact, it has been called a literature in itself, comparable in its breadth and depth and characterization to the whole of Greek literature or Shakespeare. But what makes it unique is that embedded in this literary masterpiece is one of the finest mystical documents the world has seen: the Bhagavad Gita. I must have heard the Gita recited thousands of times when I was growing up, but I dont suppose it had any special significance for me then. Not until I went to college and met Mahatma Gandhi did I begin to understand why nothing in the long, rich stretch of Indian culture has had a wider appeal, not only within India but outside as well. Today, after more than thirty years of devoted study, I would not hesitate to call it Indias most important gift to the world. The Gita has been translated into every major language and perhaps a hundred times into English alone; commentaries on it are said to be more numerous than on any other scripture. Like the Sermon on the Mount, it has an immediacy that sweeps away time, place, and circumstance. Addressed to everyone, of whatever background or status, the Gita distills the loftiest truths of Indias ancient wisdom into simple, memorable poetry that haunts the mind and informs the affairs of everyday life.  \fEveryone in our car got down from the train to wander for a few minutes on the now peaceful field. Thousands of years ago this was Armageddon. The air rang with the conch-horns and shouts of battle for eighteen days. Great phalanxes shaped like eagles and fish and the crescent moon surged back and forth in search of victory, until in the end almost every warrior in the land lay slain. Imagine! my companion said to me in awe. Bhishma and Drona commanded their armies here. Arjuna rode here, with Sri Krishna himself as his charioteer. Where youre standing now  who knows?  Arjuna might have sat, his bow and arrows on the ground, while Krishna gave him the words of the Bhagavad Gita. The thought was thrilling. I felt the way Schliemann must have when he finally reached that desolate bluff of western Turkey and knew he was standing on the ringing plains of windy Troy, walking the same ground as Achilles, Odysseus, Hector, and Helen. Yet at the same time, I felt I knew the setting of the Gita much more intimately than I could ever know this peaceful field. The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gitas subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious. THE GITA AND ITS SETTING  Historians surmise that like the Iliad, the Mahabharata might well be based on actual events, culminating in a war that took place somewhere around 1000 B.C.  close, that is, to the very dawn of recorded Indian history. This guess has recently been supported by excavations at the ancient city of Dvaraka, which, according to the Mahabharata, was destroyed and submerged in the sea after the departure of its divine ruler, Krishna. Only five hundred years or so before this, by generally accepted guess, Aryan tribes originally from the area between the Caspian Sea and the Hindu Kush mountains had migrated into the Indian subcontinent, bringing the prototype of the Sanskrit language and countless elements of belief and culture that have been part of the Hindu tradition ever since. The oldest part of the most ancient of Hindu scriptures, the Rig Veda, dates from this period  about 1500 B.C., if not earlier. Yet the wellspring of Indian religious faith, I believe, can be traced to a much earlier epoch. When the Aryans entered the Indian subcontinent through the mountains of the Hindu Kush, they encountered a civilization  \fon the banks of the Indus river that archeologists date back as far as 3000 B.C. Roughly contemporaneous with the pyramid-builders on the Nile, these Indus-dwellers achieved a comparable level of technology. They had metalworkers skilled in sheet-making, riveting, and casting of copper and bronze, crafts and industries with standardized methods of production, land and sea trade with cultures as far away as Mesopotamia, and well-planned cities with water supply and public sanitation systems unequaled until the Romans. Evidence suggests that they may have used a decimal system of measurement. But most remarkable, images of Shiva as Yogeshvara, the Lord of Yoga, suggest that meditation was practiced in a civilization which flourished a millennium before the Vedas were committed to an oral tradition. If this is so, it would imply that the same systematic attitude the Indus Valley dwellers applied to their technology was applied also to study of the mind. This was brahmavidya, the supreme science  supreme because where other sciences studied the external world, brahmavidya sought knowledge of an underlying reality which would inform all other studies and activities. Whatever its origins, in the early part of the first millennium B.C. we find clearly stated both the methods and the discoveries of brahmavidya. With this introspective tool the inspired rishis (literally seers) of ancient India analyzed their awareness of human experience to see if there was anything in it that was absolute. Their findings can be summarized in three statements which Aldous Huxley, following Leibnitz, has called the Perennial Philosophy because they appear in every age and civilization: (1) there is an infinite, changeless reality beneath the world of change; (2) this same reality lies at the core of every human personality; (3) the purpose of life is to discover this reality experientially: that is, to realize God while here on earth. These principles and the interior experiments for realizing them were taught systematically in forest academies or ashrams  a tradition which continues unbroken after some three thousand years. The discoveries of brahmavidya were systematically committed to memory (and eventually to writing) in the Upanishads, visionary documents that are the earliest and purest statement of the Perennial Philosophy. How many of these precious records once existed no one knows; a dozen that date from Vedic times have survived as part of the Hindu canon of authority, the four Vedas. All have one unmistakable hallmark: the vivid  \fstamp of personal mystical experience. These are records of direct encounter with the divine. Tradition calls them shruti: literally heard, as opposed to learned; they are their own authority. By convention, only the Vedas (including their Upanishads) are considered shruti, based on direct knowledge of God. According to this definition, all other Indian scriptures  including the Gita  are secondary, dependent on the higher authority of the Vedas. However, this is a conventional distinction and one that might disguise the nature of the documents it classifies. In the literal sense the Gita too is shruti, owing its authority not to other scriptures but to the fact that it set down the direct mystical experience of a single author. Shankara, a towering mystic of the ninth century A.D. whose word carries the authority of Augustine, Eckhart, and Aquinas all in one, must have felt this, for in selecting the minimum sources of Hinduism he passed over almost a hundred Upanishads of Vedic authority to choose ten central Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. The Gita, I would argue, is not an integral part of the Mahabharata. It is essentially an Upanishad, and my conjecture is that it was set down by an inspired seer (traditionally Vyasa) and inserted into the epic at the appropriate place. Other elements were added in this way to the Mahabharata, and to other popular secondary scriptures; it is an effective way of preserving new material in an oral tradition. There is also traditional weight behind this idea, for as far back as anyone can trace, each chapter of the Gita has ended with the same formula: In the Bhagavad-Gita Upanishad, the text on the supreme science [brahmavidya] of yoga, this is the chapter entitled . . Finally, by way of further support, we can observe that except for its first chapter, which sets the stage, the Gita not only does not develop the action of the Mahabharata but is rather at odds with it. Battle lines are drawn  the climax of decades of dissension  and on the eve of combat, Prince Arjuna loses his nerve and asks his charioteer, Krishna, what to do. Then what? Krishna  no ordinary charioteer, but an incarnation of God  enters into some seven hundred verses of sublime instruction on the nature of the soul and its relation to God, the levels of consciousness and reality, the makeup of the phenomenal world, and so on, culminating in a stupendous mystical experience in which he reveals himself to Arjuna as the transcendent Lord of life and death. He counsels Arjuna to be compassionate to friend and  \fenemy alike, to see himself in every person, to suffer others sorrows as his own. Then the Gita is over, the narration picks up again, and battle is joined  a terrible, desperate slaughter compromising everyones honor, by the end of which Arjunas side emerges victorious. But almost every man of fighting age on both sides has been slain. Only great genius would have placed the Gita in such a dramatic setting, but it stands out from the rest as a timeless, practical manual for daily living. To those who take this dramatic setting as part of the spiritual instruction and get entangled in the question of the Gita justifying war, Gandhi had a practical answer: just base your life on the Gita sincerely and systematically and see if you find killing or even hurting others compatible with its teachings. (He makes the same point of the Sermon on the Mount.) The very heart of the Gitas message is to see the Lord in every creature and act accordingly, and the scripture is full of verses to spell out what this means: I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me. They worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. (6:3031) When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. (6:32) That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. (12:13) They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. (13:2728) Scholars can debate the point forever, but when the Gita is practiced, I think, it becomes clear that the struggle the Gita is concerned with is the struggle for self-mastery. It was Vyasas genius to take the whole great Mahabharata epic and see it as metaphor for the perennial war between the forces of light and the forces of darkness in every human heart. Arjuna and Krishna are then no longer merely characters in a literary masterpiece. Arjuna becomes Everyman, asking the Lord himself, Sri Krishna, the  \fperennial questions about life and death  not as a philosopher, but as the quintessential man of action. Thus read, the Gita is not an external dialogue but an internal one: between the ordinary human personality, full of questions about the meaning of life, and our deepest Self, which is divine. There is, in fact, no other way to read the Gita and grasp it as spiritual instruction. If I could offer only one key to understanding this divine dialogue, it would be to remember that it takes place in the depths of consciousness and that Krishna is not some external being, human or superhuman, but the spark of divinity that lies at the core of the human personality. This is not literary or philosophical conjecture; Krishna says as much to Arjuna over and over: I am the Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence (10:20). In such statements the Gita distills the essence of the Upanishads, not piecemeal but comprehensively, offering their lofty insights as a manual not of philosophy but of everyday human activity  a handbook of the Perennial Philosophy unique in world history. THE UPANISHADIC BACKGROUND  The Gita, naturally enough, takes for granted that its audience is familiar with the basic ideas of Hindu religious thought, almost all of which can be found in the Upanishads. It also uses some technical vocabulary from yoga psychology. All this needs to be explained in contemporary terms if the modern reader is to grasp what is essential and timeless in the Gitas message and not get bogged down in strange terminology. First, however, the non-Hindu faces a third obstacle: the multiplicity of names used for aspects of God. From the earliest times, Hinduism has proclaimed one God while accommodating worship of him (or her, for to millions God is the Divine Mother) in many different names. Truth is one, says a famous verse of the Rig Veda; people call it by various names. Monastic devotees might find that Shiva embodies the austere detachment they seek; devotees who want to live in the world, partaking of its innocent pleasures but devoted to service of their fellow creatures, might find in Krishna the perfect incarnation of their ideals. In every case, this clothing of the Infinite in human form serves to focus a devotees love and to provide an inspiring ideal. But whatever form is worshipped, it is only an aspect of the same one God.  \fIn the Gita  in fact, virtually everywhere in Hindu myth and scripture  we also encounter the gods in the plural. These are the devas, deities which seem to have come in with the Aryans and which have recognizable counterparts in other Aryan-influenced cultures: Indra, god of war and storm; Varuna, god of waters and a moral overseer; Agni, god of fire, the Hermes-like intermediary between heaven and earth; and so on. The Gita refers to the devas as being worshipped by those who want to propitiate natural and supernatural powers, in much the same way that ancestors were worshipped. In modern terms, they can best be understood as personifying the forces of nature. This question out of the way, we can proceed to the Upanishadic background the Gita assumes. Atman and Brahman  The Upanishads are not systematic philosophy; they are more like ecstatic slide shows of mystical experience  vivid, disjointed, stamped with the power of direct personal encounter with the divine. If they seem to embrace contradictions, that is because they do not try to smooth over the seams of these experiences. They simply set down what the rishis saw, viewing the ultimate reality from different levels of spiritual awareness, like snapshots of the same object from different angles: now seeing God as utterly transcendent, for example, now seeing God as immanent as well. These differences are not important, and the Upanishads agree on their central ideas: Brahman, the Godhead; Atman, the divine core of personality; dharma, the law that expresses and maintains the unity of creation; karma, the web of cause and effect; samsara, the cycle of birth and death; moksha, the spiritual liberation that is lifes supreme goal. Even while ancient India was making breakthroughs in the natural sciences and mathematics, the sages of the Upanishads were turning inward to analyze the data that nature presents to the mind. Penetrating below the senses, they found not a world of solid, separate objects but a ceaseless process of change  matter coming together, dissolving, and coming together again in a different form. Below this flux of things with name and form, however, they found something changeless: an infinite, indivisible reality in which the transient data of the world cohere. They called this reality Brahman: the Godhead, the divine ground of existence.  \fThis analysis of the phenomenal world tallies well enough with contemporary physics. A physicist would remind us that the things we see out there are not ultimately separate from each other and from us; we perceive them as separate because of the limitations of our senses. If our eyes were sensitive to a much finer spectrum, we might see the world as a continuous field of matter and energy. Nothing in this picture resembles a solid object in our usual sense of the word. The external world of physics, wrote Sir Arthur Eddington, has thus become a world of shadows. In removing our illusions we remove the substance, for indeed we have seen that substance is one of the greatest of our illusions. Like the physicists, these ancient sages were seeking an invariant. They found it in Brahman. In examining our knowledge of ourselves, the sages made a similar discovery. Instead of a single coherent personality, they found layer on layer of components  senses, emotions, will, intellect, ego  each in flux. At different times and in different company, the same person seems to have different personalities. Moods shift and flicker, even in those who are emotionally stable; desires and opinions change with time. Change is the nature of the mind. The sages observed this flow of thoughts and sensations and asked, Then where am I? The parts do not add up to a whole; they just flow by. Like physical phenomena, the mind is a field of forces, no more the seat of intelligence than radiation or gravity is. Just as the world dissolves into a sea of energy, the mind dissolves into a river of impressions and thoughts, a flow of fragmentary data that do not hold together. Western philosophers have reasoned their way to a similar conclusion, but with them it was an intellectual exercise. David Hume confesses that whenever he was forced to conclude that his empirical ego was insubstantial, he went out for a walk, had a good dinner, and forgot all about it. For these ancient sages, however, these were not logical conclusions but personal discoveries. They were actually exploring the mind, testing each level of awareness by withdrawing consciousness to the level below. In profound meditation, they found, when consciousness is so acutely focused that it is utterly withdrawn from the body and mind, it enters a kind of singularity in which the sense of a separate ego disappears. In this state, the supreme climax of meditation, the seers discovered a core of consciousness beyond time and change. They called it simply Atman, the Self. I have described the discovery of Atman and Brahman  God immanent and God transcendent  as separate, but there is no real distinction. In the  \fclimax of meditation, the sages discovered unity: the same indivisible reality without and within. It was advaita, not two. The Chandogya Upanishad says epigrammatically, Tat tvam asi: Thou art That. Atman is Brahman: the Self in each person is not different from the Godhead. Nor is it different from person to person. The Self is one, the same in every creature. This is not some peculiar tenet of the Hindu scriptures; it is the testimony of everyone who has undergone these experiments in the depths of consciousness and followed them through to the end. Here is Ruysbroeck, a great mystic of medieval Europe; every word is most carefully chosen: The image of God is found essentially and personally in all mankind. Each possesses it whole, entire and undivided, and all together not more than one alone. In this way we are all one, intimately united in our eternal image, which is the image of God and the source in us of all our life. Maya  In the unitive experience, every trace of separateness disappears; life is a seamless whole. But the body cannot remain in this state for long. After a while, awareness of mind and body returns, and then the conventional world of multiplicity rushes in again with such vigor and vividness that the memory of unity, though stamped with reality, seems as distant as a dream. The unitive state has to be entered over and over until a person is established in it. But once established, even in the midst of ordinary life, one sees the One underlying the many, the Eternal beneath the ephemeral. What is it that makes undivided reality appear to be a world of separate, transient objects? What makes each of us believe that we are the body rather than our own Self? The sages answered with a story still told after thousands of years. Imagine, they said, a man dreaming that he is being attacked by a tiger. His pulse will race, his fists will clench, his forehead will be wet with the dew of fear  all just as if the attack were real. He will be able to describe the look of his tiger, the way he smelled, the sound of his roar. For him the tiger is real, and in a sense he is not wrong: the evidence he has is not qualitatively different from the kind of evidence we trust when we are awake. People have even died from the physiological effects of a potent dream. Only when we wake up can we realize that our  \fdream-sensations, though real to our nervous system, are a lower level of reality than the waking state. The Upanishads delineate three ordinary states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep. Each is real, but each has a higher order of reality. For beyond these three, the Upanishads say, is the unitive state, called simply the fourth: turiya. Entering this state is similar to waking up out of dream sleep: the individual passes from a lower level of reality to a higher one. The sages called the dream of waking life  the dream of separate, merely physical existence  by a suggestive name, maya. In general use the word meant a kind of magic, the power of a god or sorcerer to make a thing appear to be something else. In the Gita, maya becomes the creative power of the Godhead, the primal creative energy that makes unity appear as the world of innumerable separate things with name and form. Later philosophers explained maya in surprisingly contemporary terms. The mind, they said, observes the so-called outside world and sees its own structure. It reports that the world consists of a multiplicity of separate objects in a framework of time, space, and causality because these are the conditions of perception. In a word, the mind looks at unity and sees diversity; it looks at what is timeless and reports transience. And in fact the percepts of its experience are diverse and transient; on this level of experience, separateness is real. Our mistake is in taking this for ultimate reality, like the dreamer thinking that nothing is real except his dream. Nowhere has this mysterious Eastern notion been formulated more succinctly than in the epigram of Ruysbroeck: We behold what we are, and we are what we behold. When we look at unity through the instruments of the mind, we see diversity; when the mind is transcended, we enter a higher mode of knowing  turiya, the fourth state of consciousness  in which duality disappears. This does not mean, however, that the phenomenal world is an illusion or unreal. The illusion is the sense of separateness. Here again we can illustrate from physics: the world of name and form exists only as a condition of perception; at the subatomic level, separate phenomena dissolve into a flux of energy. The effect of maya is similar. The world of the senses is real, but it must be known for what it is: unity appearing as multiplicity. Those who disidentify themselves with the conditions of perception in maya wake up into a higher mode of knowing in which the unity of life is  \fapprehended directly. The disciplines for achieving this are called yoga, as is the state of union: the word comes from the root yuj, to yoke or bind together. The experience itself (properly speaking, it is beyond experience) is called samadhi. And the state attained is moksha or nirvana, both of which signify going beyond the conditioning of maya  time, space, and causality. In this state we realize that we are not a physical creature but the Atman, the Self, and thus not separate from God. We see the world not as pieces but whole, and we see that whole as a manifestation of God. Once identified with the Self, we know that although the body will die, we will not die; our awareness of this identity is not ruptured by the death of the physical body. Thus we have realized the essential immortality which is the birthright of every human being. To such a person, the Gita says, death is no more traumatic than taking off an old coat (2:22). Life cannot offer any higher realization. The supreme goal of human existence has been attained. The man or woman who realizes God has everything and lacks nothing: having this, they desire nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow (6:22). Life cannot threaten such a person; all it holds is the opportunity to love, to serve, and to give. Dharma, Karma, Rebirth, and Liberation  It has been said that if you understand just two words, dharma and karma, you will have grasped the essence of Hinduism. This is a simplification, but it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of these concepts. Both are deeply embedded in Hindu thought, and the Gita, like other Hindu scriptures, takes them for granted, not as theoretical premises but as facts of life that can be verified in personal experience. The word dharma means many things, but its underlying sense is that which supports, from the root dhri, to support, hold up, or bear. Generally, dharma implies support from within: the essence of a thing, its virtue, that which makes it what it is. An old story illumines this meaning with the highest ideal of Hinduism. A sage, seated beside the Ganges, notices a scorpion that has fallen into the water. He reaches down and rescues it, only to be stung. Some time later he looks down and sees the scorpion thrashing about in the water again. Once more he reaches down to rescue it, and once more he is stung. A bystander,  \fobserving all this, exclaims, Holy one, why do you keep doing that? Dont you see that the wretched creature will only sting you in return? Of course, the sage replied. It is the dharma of a scorpion to sting. But it is the dharma of a human being to save. On a larger scale, dharma means the essential order of things, an integrity and harmony in the universe and the affairs of life that cannot be disturbed without courting chaos. Thus it means rightness, justice, goodness, purpose rather than chance. Underlying this idea is the oneness of life: the Upanishadic discovery that all things are interconnected because at its deepest level creation is indivisible. This oneness bestows a basic balance on the whole of nature such that any disturbance in one place has to send ripples everywhere, as a perfect bubble, touched lightly in one place, trembles all over until balance is restored. The implications are caught perfectly by those famous lines from John Donne, which deserve to be read now with a fresh eye as not merely great rhetoric but a faithful representation of reality: No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee. There is an ancient Sanskrit epigram, Ahimsa paramo dharma: the highest dharma is ahimsa, nonviolence, universal love for all living creatures; for every kind of violence is a violation of dharma, the fundamental law of the unity of life. Thus every act or thought has consequences, which themselves will have consequences; life is the most intricate web of interconnections. This is the law of karma, one of the most important and least understood ideas in ancient Indian thought. Karma is repeated so often in the Gita that I want to illustrate it in some detail: some intuitive sense of karma as an organic law makes Krishnas teachings a good deal clearer. Literally, the Sanskrit karma means something that is done. Often it can be translated as deed or action. The law of karma states simply that every event is both a cause and an effect. Every act has consequences of a similar  \fkind, which in turn have further consequences and so on; and every act, every karma, is also the consequence of some previous karma. This refers not only to physical action but to mental activity as well. In their analysis of the phenomenal world and the world within, the sages of the Upanishads found that there is not merely an accidental but an essential relationship between mental and physical activity. Given appropriate conditions to develop further, thoughts breed actions of the same kind, as a seed can grow only into one particular kind of tree. Baldly put, the law of karma says that whatever you do will come back to you. No one, of course, has the omniscience to see the picture fully. But the idea of a network of connections, far from being occult, is natural and plausible. The law of karma states unequivocally that though we cannot see the connections, we can be sure that everything that happens to us, good and bad, originated once in something we did or thought. We ourselves are responsible for what happens to us, whether or not we can understand how. It follows that we can change what happens to us by changing ourselves; we can take our destiny into our own hands. The physical side of karma, however, only touches the surface of life. To get an inkling of how karma really works, we have to consider the mind. Everything we do produces karma in the mind. In fact, it is in the mind rather than the world that karmas seeds are planted. Aptly, Indian philosophy compares a thought to a seed: very tiny, but it can grow into a huge, deep-rooted, wide-spreading tree. I have seen places where a seed in a crack of a pavement grew into a tree that tore up the sidewalk. It is difficult to remove such a tree, and terribly difficult to undo the effects of a lifetime of negative thinking, which can extend into many other peoples lives. But it can be done, and the purpose of the Gita is to show how. Karma is sometimes considered punitive, a matter of getting ones just desserts. This is accurate enough, but it is much more illuminating to consider karma an educative force whose purpose is to teach the individual to act in harmony with dharma  not to pursue selfish interests at the expense of others, but to contribute to life and consider the welfare of the whole. In this sense life is like a school; one can learn, one can graduate, one can skip a grade or stay behind. As long as a debt of karma remains, however, a person has to keep coming back for further education. That is the basis of samsara, the cycle of birth and death.  \fA good many wrong and misleading words have been written on this subject, largely because of the fascination it seems to hold in the West. Rightly understood, however, reincarnation is not exotic but quite natural. If personality consists of several sheaths, the body being only the outermost, there is no reason why personality should die when the body is shed. The sages of the Upanishads saw personality as a field of forces. Packets of karma to them are forces that have to work themselves out; if the process is interrupted by death, those forces remain until conditions allow them to work again in a new context. Again, sleep can illustrate the dynamics of this idea. In sleep a person passes in and out of two stages, dreaming and dreamless sleep. In the first, consciousness is withdrawn from the body and senses but still engaged in the mind. In dreamless sleep, however, consciousness is withdrawn from the mind as well. Then the thinking process  even the sense of I  is temporarily suspended, and consciousness is said to rest in the Self. In this state a person ceases to be a separate creature, a separate personality. In dreamless sleep, the Upanishads say, a king is not a king nor a pauper poor; no one is old or young, male or female, educated or ignorant. When consciousness returns to the mind, however, the thinking process starts up again, and personality returns to the body. According to this analysis, the ego dies every night. Every morning we pick up our desires where we left off: the same person, yet a little different too. The Upanishads describe dying as a very similar process. Consciousness is withdrawn from the body into the senses, from the senses into the mind, and finally consolidated in the ego; when the body is finally wrenched away, the ego remains, a potent package of desires and karma. And as our last waking thoughts shape our dreams, the contents of the unconscious at the time of death  the residue of all that we have thought and desired and lived for in the past  determine the context of our next life. We take a body again, the sages say, to come back to just the conditions where our desires and karma can be fulfilled. The Self-realized person, however, has no karma to work out, no personal desires; at the time of death he or she is absorbed into the Lord: But they for whom I am the supreme goal, who do all work renouncing self for me and meditate on me with single-hearted devotion, these I  \fwill swiftly rescue from the fragments cycle of birth and death, for their consciousness has entered into me. (12:67) Such a person, the Upanishads stress, can actually shed the body voluntarily when the hour of death arrives, by withdrawing consciousness step by step in full awareness. Some of the Gitas most fascinating verses, for those who can interpret them, are Krishnas instructions on how to die (8:1213). YOGA PSYCHOLOGY  In trying to describe their discoveries, the Upanishadic seers developed a specialized vocabulary. Their terms were later elaborated by mystics who were also brilliant philosophers  Kapila, Shankara, and others, the ancient Indian counterparts of authorities like Augustine and Aquinas in the West. The most useful part of this vocabulary comes from Sankhya, the philosophical system whose practical counterpart is the school of meditation called Yoga. Both are traditionally traced to one towering authority, Kapila, and have much in common with Buddhist philosophy. An ancient saying celebrates their practicality: There is no theory like Sankhya, no practice like Yoga. The Gita does not belong to the Sankhya school or to any other; it is as comprehensive as the Upanishads. But Sankhya provides a precise vocabulary for describing the workings of the mind, and the Gita draws on that vocabulary freely. Sankhya philosophy posits two separate categories: Purusha, spirit, and prakriti, everything else. This is not the Western mind-matter distinction. Prakriti is the field of what can be known objectively, the field of phenomena, the world of whatever has name and form: that is, not only of matter and energy but also of the mind. As physics postulates a unified field from which all phenomena can be derived, Sankhya describes a field that includes mental phenomena as well. Mind, energy, and matter all belong to a field of forces. Purusha, pure spirit, is the knower of this field of phenomena, and belongs to a wholly different order of reality. Only Purusha is conscious  or, rather, Purusha is consciousness itself. What we call mind is only an internal instrument that Purusha uses, just as the body is its external instrument. For practical purposes  at least as far as the Gita is  \fconcerned  Purusha may be regarded as a synonym for Atman. Purusha is the Self, beyond all change, the same in every creature. Matter and Mind  Perhaps I should confess at this point that the paragraphs that follow in this short section are somewhat technical and not necessary for understanding the Gita. They can be skipped by anyone who finds them dry. I include them simply because Sankhyas explanation of mind and matter, when properly understood, makes sense of many subjects in the Gita that might otherwise seem arbitrary: maya, the survival of personality after death, the way karma works through the mind. It accommodates modern physics perfectly and offers promising explanations of mind-body relationships in health and disease. However, Sankhyas way of looking at the mind is very different from our usual physical orientation, and therefore impossible to absorb without reflection. Sankhyas hallmark is a list (sankhya means counting or listing) of twenty-four principles or tattvas (suchnesses) which trace the steps by which unitary, primordial prakriti becomes manifested as the countless forms of mind, matter, and energy that make up the world we live in. The tattvas are listed in the Gita: The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy [prakriti] from which all these evolved. (13:5) I know of no English words to use for most of these twenty-four constituents. Manas corresponds roughly to mind the way that word is commonly used; buddhi is the discriminative faculty, the discriminating intellect; ahamkara, literally I-maker, is the sense of ego. I have used such rough labels in the translation which follows, but really they are technical terms with precise definitions, each associated with a specific function and level of consciousness. Approximations are misleading because they bring in associations from Western philosophy, which has a wholly different orientation. Behind all these categories lies a powerful, practical assumption: Sankhya is not trying to describe physical reality; it is  \fanalyzing consciousness, knowledge, for the sole purpose of unraveling the human beings true identity. So it does not begin with the material universe as something different and separate from the mind that perceives it. It does not talk about sense objects outside us and senses within and then try to get the two together. It begins with one world of experience. Sense objects and senses are not separate; they are two aspects of the same event. Mind, energy, and matter are a continuum, and the universe is not described as it might be in itself, but as it presents itself to the human mind. As they say in the new physics, it is not just an observable universe but a participatory universe. Let me illustrate. This morning I had a fresh mango for breakfast: a large, beautiful, fragrant one which had been allowed to ripen until just the right moment, when the skin was luminous with reds and oranges. You can see from that kind of description that I like mangoes. I must have eaten thousands of them when I was growing up, and I probably know most varieties intimately by their color, shape, flavor, fragrance, and feel. Sankhya would say that this mango I appreciated so much does not exist in the world outside  at least, not with the qualities I ascribed to it. The mango-in-itself, for example, is not red and orange; these are categories of a nervous system that can deal only with a narrow range of radiant energy. My dog Bogart would not see a luscious red and orange mango. He would see some gray mass with no distinguishing features, much less interesting to him than a piece of buttered toast. But my mind takes in messages from five senses and fits them into a precise mango-form in consciousness, and that form  nothing outside  is what I experience. Not that there is no real mango! But what I experience, the objects of my sense perception and my knowing, are in consciousness, nowhere else. A brilliant neuroscientist I was reading recently says something similar in contemporary language: we never really encounter the world; all we experience is our own nervous system. When the Gita says that the material world is made up of five material elements, then, it is talking about the world as we perceive it through our five senses. The objects of this world are in the mind, not outside. Physical objects in this sense require a mental component also: five essences or mental conditions of perception, each corresponding to one of the five senses. From these five tanmatras derive on the one hand the five sense organs, and on the other hand the five material elements. You can see that  \fthe number five and the correspondences of Sankhya are not arbitrary, but reflect the ways we have of sorting electrical information supplied to the brain. Four of these elements have names similar to those from ancient philosophy in the West  earth, air, fire, and water. But if we remember that we are talking about principles of perception rather than earth-stuff, firestuff, and so on, it should become clear that this is not an antiquated theory left behind by the progress of physical science. It is quite sophisticated and accommodates contemporary physical thought rather well, for it recognizes that in the act of knowing, the mind conditions what is known. Senses and sense objects, then, are very intimately related. There is a causal connection, for example, between the things we see and the physical organ of seeing, the eye and its related branches of the nervous system: both depend on the underlying form in the mind that conditions how we perceive light. The objects we see are shaped by the way we see. So senses and sense objects make sense only together: each is incomplete without the other. That is why there is such a strong pull between senses and sense objects. On the other hand, the Gita says, this pull has nothing to do with us  the Self, the knower. When Krishna keeps telling Arjuna to train his mind to be alike in pleasure and pain, he is simply being practical: to discover unity, consciousness has to be withdrawn from the hold of the senses, which ties it to duality. When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. Those who are not affected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. (2:1415) The sensory attraction of pleasure is just an interaction between inert elements of similar stuff, very much like a magnetic pull between two objects. We are not involved. When I look at a fresh, ripe mango, it is natural for my senses to respond; that is their nature. But I should be able to stand aside and watch this interaction with detachment, the way people stand and watch while movers unload a van. In that way I can enjoy what my senses report without ever having to act compulsively on their likes and dislikes.  \fSankhyas explanation of mind and body has profound implications for psychosomatic medicine. In a system where mental phenomena and biochemical events take place in the same field, it is much easier to account for how ways of thinking affect the body. If one idea is central to yoga psychology, it is that thoughts are real and have real, tangible consequences, as we saw in the discussion of karma. Sankhya describes thoughts as packets of potential energy, which grow more and more solid when favorable conditions are present and obstacles are removed. They become desires, then habits, then ways of living with physical consequences. Those consequences may look no more like thoughts than an oak tree looks like an acorn, but the Gita says they are just as intimately related. Just as a seed can grow into only one kind of tree, thoughts can produce effects only of the same nature. Kindness to others, to take just one example, favors a nervous system that is kind to itself. The Forces of Evolution  Sankhya describes prakriti as a field of forces called gunas  a concept that gets a good deal of attention in the Gita. According to Sankhya, the evolution of primordial prakriti into mind and matter begins when the equilibrium of prakriti is disturbed. In Hindu myth this is the dawn of the Day of Brahma (8:1721), a period of explosive expansion not unlike the Big Bang of modern cosmology. At this instant of creation, thrown into imbalance, prakriti differentiates itself into three basic states or qualities of primordial energy. These are the gunas. Every state of matter and mind is a combination of these three: tamas, inertia, rajas, activity, and sattva, harmony or equilibrium. These are only rough translations, for the gunas have no equivalent in any other philosophy I know. The gunas can be illustrated by comparison with the three states of matter in classical physics: solid, liquid, and gas. Tamas is frozen energy, the resistance of inertia. A block of ice has a good deal of energy in the chemical bonds that hold it together, but the energy is locked in, bound up, rigid. When the ice melts, some of that energy is released as the water flows; rajas, activity, is like a swollen river, full of uncontrolled power. And sattva, harmony, can be compared with steam when its power is harnessed. These are very imprecise parallels, but they convey an important point  \fabout the gunas: all three are states of energy, and each can be converted into the others. Guna means strand, and in the Gita the gunas are described as the very fabric of existence, the veil that hides unity in a covering of diversity. Tamas is mayas power of concealment, the darkness or ignorance that hides unitive reality; rajas distracts and scatters awareness, turning it away from reality toward the diversity of the outside world. Thus the gunas are essentially born of the mind. When the minds activity is stilled, we see life as it is. We can also think of the gunas as different levels of consciousness. Tamas, the lowest level, is the vast unconscious, a chaotic dumping ground for the residue of past mental states. Unconscious in this sense has something in common with Jungs collective unconscious, in that it is the repository not only of past experiences but also of our evolutionary heritage, the basic drives of the human beings animal past. This record is shared, of course, by all human beings, and at its deepest levels the unconscious is universal. There is no choice in tamas, no awareness; this is complete ignorance of the unity of life, ignorance of any other need than ones own basic urges. Rajas is what we ordinarily mean by mind, the incessant stream of thought that races along, desiring, worrying, resenting, scheming, competing, frustrating and getting frustrated. Rajas is power released, but uncontrolled and egocentric. Sattva, finally, is the so-called higher mind  detached, unruffled, selfcontrolled. This is not a state of repressive regulation, but the natural harmony that comes with unity of purpose, character, and desire. Negative states of mind do still come up, prompted by tamas and rajas, but there is no need to act on them. According to Sankhya, everything in the world of mind and matter is an expression of all three gunas, with one guna always predominant. This becomes particularly interesting in describing personality as a field of forces. The rajasic person is full of energy; the tamasic person is sluggish, indifferent, insensitive; the sattvic person, calm, resourceful, compassionate, and selfless. Yet all three are always present at some level of awareness, and their proportions change: their interplay is the dynamics of personality. The same individual will have times when he is bursting with energy and times when inertia descends and paralyzes his will, times  \fwhen he is thoughtful and other times when he is moving so fast that he never notices those around him. The person is the same; he is simply experiencing the play of the gunas. As long as he identifies with his body and mind, he is at the mercy of this play. But the Self is not involved in the gunas interaction; it is witness rather than participant: Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. (13:14) The gunas form the basis of the most compassionate account of human nature I have come across in any philosophy or psychology, East or West. They not only explain differences in character; they describe the basic forces of personality and allow the possibility of reshaping ourselves after a higher ideal. Because personality is a process, the human being is constantly remaking himself or herself. Left to itself, the mind goes on repeating the same old habitual patterns of personality. By training the mind, however, anyone can learn to step in and change old ways of thinking; that is the central principle of yoga: Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. (6:5) The Gita speaks of this kind of growth as part of spiritual evolution. In its natural state, consciousness is a continuous flow of awareness. But through the distorting action of the gunas, we have fallen from this native state into fragmented, sometimes stagnant awareness. Seeing through a divided mind, we see life divided wherever we look: separate selves, antagonistic interests, conflicts within ourselves. Evolution, according to the Gita, is a painfully slow return to our native state. First tamas must be transformed into rajas  apathy and insensitiveness into energetic, enthusiastic activity. But the energy of rajas is self-centered and dispersed; it must be harnessed to a higher ideal by the will. Then it becomes sattva, when all this passionate energy is channeled into selfless action. This state is marked by happiness, a calm mind, abundant vitality, and the concentration of genius. But even this is not the end. The goal of evolution is to return to unity: that is, to still the mind. Then the soul rests in pure, unitary consciousness,  \fwhich is a state of permanent joy. In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. (6:20) THE ESSENCE OF THE GITA  The Gita does not present a system of philosophy. It offers something to every seeker after God, of whatever temperament, by whatever path. The reason for this universal appeal is that it is basically practical: it is a handbook for Self-realization and a guide to action. Some scholars will find practicality a tall claim, because the Gita is full of lofty and even abstruse philosophy. Yet even its philosophy is not there to satisfy intellectual curiosity; it is meant to explain to spiritual aspirants why they are asked to undergo certain disciplines. Like any handbook, the Gita makes most sense when it is practiced. As the traditional chapter titles put it, the Gita is brahmavidyayam yogashastra, a textbook on the supreme science of yoga. But yoga is a word with many meanings  as many, perhaps, as there are paths to Selfrealization. What kind of yoga does the Gita teach? The common answer is that it presents three yogas or even four  the four main paths of Hindu mysticism. In jnana yoga, the yoga of knowledge, aspirants use their will and discrimination to disidentify themselves from the body, mind, and senses until they know they are nothing but the Self. The followers of bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion, achieve the same goal by identifying themselves completely with the Lord in love; by and large, this is the path taken by most of the mystics of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. In karma yoga, the yoga of selfless action, the aspirants dissolve their identification with body and mind by identifying with the whole of life, forgetting the finite self in the service of others. And the followers of raja yoga, the yoga of meditation, discipline the mind and senses until the mind-process is suspended in a healing stillness and they merge in the Self. Indians like to classify, and the eighteen chapters of the Gita are said to break into three six-chapter parts. The first third, according to this, deals with karma yoga, the second with jnana yoga, and the last with bhakti yoga: that is, the Gita begins with the way of selfless action, passes into the way of Self-knowledge, and ends with the way of love. This scheme is not tight,  \fand non-Hindu readers may find it difficult to discover in the text. But the themes are there, and Krishna clearly shifts his emphasis as he goes on using this one word yoga. Here he focuses on transcendental knowledge, there on selfless action, here on meditation, there on love. Thus the Gita offers something for every kind of spiritual aspirant, and for two thousand years each of the major schools of Indian philosophy has quoted the Gita in defense of its particular claims. This fluidity sometimes exasperates scholars, who feel the Gita contradicts itself. It also puzzled Arjuna, the faithful representative of you and me. Krishna, he says at the beginning of chapter 3, youve been telling me that knowledge [jnana] is better than action [karma]; so why do you urge me into such terrible action? Your words are inconsistent; they confuse me. Tell me one path to the highest good (3:12). No doubt he speaks for every reader at this point, and for those who go on wanting one path only, the confusion simply grows worse. For those who try to practice the Gita, however, there is a thread of inner consistency running through Krishnas advice. Like a person walking around the same object, the Gita takes more than one point of view. Whenever Krishna describes one of the traditional paths to God he looks at it from the inside, extolling its virtues over the others. For the time being, that is the path; when he talks about yoga, he means that one particular yoga. Thus this ancient word yoga, says Gandhis intimate friend and secretary, Mahadev Desai, is pressed by the Gita into service to mean the entire gamut of human endeavor to storm the gates of heaven. . [It means] the yoking of all the powers of the body and the mind and soul to God; it means the discipline of the intellect, the mind, the emotions, the will, which such a yoking presupposes; it means a poise of the soul which enables one to look at life in all its aspects and evenly. The Gita brings together all the specialized senses of the word yoga to emphasize their common meaning: the sum of what one must do to realize the Self. The thread through Krishnas teaching, the essence of the Gita, can be given in one word: renunciation. This is the common factor in the four yogas. It is a bleak word in English, conjuring up the austerity and self-  \fdeprivation enjoined on the monastic orders  the poverty, chastity, and obedience so perfectly embodied by Francis of Assisi. When the Gita promises freedom through renunciation, the impression most of us get is that we are being asked to give up everything we want out of life; in this drab state, having lost whatever we value, we will be free from sorrow. Who wants that kind of freedom? But this is not at all what the Gita means. It does not even enjoin material renunciation, although it certainly encourages simplicity. As always, its emphasis is on the mind. It teaches that we can become free by giving up not material things, but selfish attachments to material things  and, more important, to people. It asks us to renounce not the enjoyment of life, but the clinging to selfish enjoyment whatever it may cost others. It pleads, in a word, for the renunciation of selfishness in thought, word, and action  a theme that is common to all mystics, West and East alike. Mahatma Gandhi encapsulates the Gitas message in one phrase: nishkama karma, selfless action, work free from any selfish motives. In this special sense, whatever path the Gita is presenting at a given time, it remains essentially a manual of karma yoga, for it is addressed to the person who wants to realize God without giving up an active life in the world. In the Gita the four traditional yogas are not watertight compartments, and in practice, all of them blend and support each other on the path to Self-realization. Nishkama karma means literally work that is without kama, that is, without selfish desire. This word kama  indeed the whole idea of desire in Hindu and Buddhist psychology  is frequently misunderstood. These religions, it is sometimes held, teach an ideal of desireless action, a nirvana equated with the extinction of all desires. This drab view is far from the truth. Desire is the fuel of life; without desire nothing can be achieved, let alone so stupendous a feat as Self-realization. Kama is not desire; it is selfish desire. The Buddha calls it tanha, thirst: the fierce, compulsive craving for personal satisfaction that demands to be slaked at any cost, whether to oneself or to others. Thus the concept also includes what Western mystics call self-will  the naked ego insisting on getting what it wants for its own gratification. The Gita teaches simply that this selfish craving is what makes a person feel separate from the rest of life. When it is extinguished  the literal meaning of nirvana  the mask of the transient, petty empirical ego falls, revealing our real Self.  \fWork hard in the world without any selfish attachment, the Gita counsels, and you will purify your consciousness of self-will. In this way any man or woman can gradually attain freedom from the bondage of selfish conditioning. This is a mental discipline, not just a physical one, and I want to repeat that to understand the Gita, it is important to look beneath the surface of its injunctions and see the mental state involved. Nishkama karma is not good works or philanthropic activity; work can benefit others and still carry a substantial measure of ego involvement. Such work is good, but it is not yoga. It may benefit others, but it will not necessarily benefit the doer. Everything depends on the state of mind. Action without selfish motive purifies the mind: the doer is less likely to be ego-driven later. The same action done with a selfish motive entangles a person further, precisely by strengthening that motive so it is more likely to prompt selfish action again. In the Gita this is said in many ways, and from differences in language it may seem that Krishna is giving different pieces of advice. In practice, however, it becomes evident that these are only various ways of saying the same thing. To begin with, Krishna often tells Arjuna to renounce the fruits of action (karma-phala): You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself  without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. (2:4748) Fruits, of course, means the outcome. What Krishna means is to give up attachment to the results of what you do: that is, to give your best to every undertaking without insisting that the results work out the way you want, or even whether what you do is pleasant or unpleasant. You have the right to action, but not to the fruits of action: each of us has the obligation to act rightly, but no power to dictate what is to come of what we do. Mahatma Gandhi explains with the authority of his personal experience: By detachment I mean that you must not worry whether the desired result follows from your action or not, so long as your motive is pure,  \fyour means correct. Really, it means that things will come right in the end if you take care of the means and leave the rest to Him. But renunciation of fruit, Gandhi warns, in no way means indifference to the result. In regard to every action one must know the result that is expected to follow, the means thereto, and the capacity for it. He who, being thus equipped, is without desire for the result and is yet wholly engrossed in the due fulfillment of the task before him, is said to have renounced the fruits of his action. This attitude frees us completely. Whatever comes  success or failure, praise or blame, victory or defeat  we can give our best with a clear, unruffled mind. Nothing can shake our courage or break our will; no setback can depress us or make us feel burned out. Clearly, as the Gita says, Yoga is skill in action (2:50). Only the person who is utterly detached and utterly dedicated, Gandhi says, is free to enjoy life. Asked to sum up his life in twenty-five words or less, he replied, I can do it in three! and quoted the Isha Upanishad: Renounce and enjoy. Those who are compulsively attached to the results of action cannot really enjoy what they do; they get downcast when things do not work out and cling more desperately when they do. So the Gita classifies the karma of attachment as pleasant at first, but bitter as poison in the end (18:38), because of the painful bondage of conditioning. Again, Krishna repeatedly tells Arjuna to surrender everything to him in love. But this is not different advice, merely different words. Krishna is asking Arjuna to act entirely for His sake, not for any personal gain. The whole point of the path of love is to transform motivation from I, I, I to thou, thou, thou  that is, to surrender selfish attachments by dissolving them in the desire to give. Krishna puts this most beautifully in the famous verses of Chapter 9 which begin, Whatever you do, make it an offering to me (9:27). Do it, that is, not for personal reward but out of love for the Lord, present in every creature. Whatever you eat, whatever worship you perform, whatever you give, whatever you suffer: everything is to be done and given and endured and enjoyed for the sake of the Lord in all, not for ourselves. Manmana: this is the refrain of the Gita. Krishna tells Arjuna repeatedly, Fill your  \fmind with me, focus every thought on me, think of me always; then you will be united with me (see 9:34). The same injunction was given to Moses and reiterated by Jesus and Mohammed. In practical terms, it means that awareness will be integrated down to the deepest recesses of the unconscious, which is precisely the significance of the word yoga. Meister Eckhart says eloquently of this state: Whoever has God in mind, simply and solely God, in all things, such a man carries God with him into all his works and into all places, and God alone does all his works. He seeks nothing but God; nothing seems good to him but God. He becomes one with God in every thought. Just as no multiplicity can dissipate God, so nothing can dissipate this man or make him multiple. Thus we arrive at the idea of actionless action: of persons so established in identification with the Self that in the midst of tireless service of those around them, they remain in inner peace, the still witness of action. They do not act, the Gita says; it is the Self that acts through them: They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved (13:29). Again, this is a universal testimony. Here is one of the most active of mystics, St. Catherine of Genoa: When the soul is naughted and transformed, then of herself she neither works nor speaks nor wills, nor feels nor hears nor understands; neither has she of herself the feeling of outward or inward, where she may move. And in all things it is God who rules and guides her, without the mediation of any creature. And the state of this soul is then a feeling of such utter peace and tranquility that it seems to her that her heart, and her bodily being, and all both within and without, is immersed in an ocean of utmost peace. . And she is so full of peace that though she press her flesh, her nerves, her bones, no other thing comes forth from them than peace. Again, when the Gita talks about inaction in the midst of action (4:18, etc.), we can call on Ruysbroeck to illumine the seeming paradox. The person who has realized God, he says, mirrors both His aspects: tranquility according to His essence, activity according to His nature: absolute repose, absolute fecundity. And he adds,  \fThe interior person lives his life according to these two ways; that is to say, in rest and in work. And in each of them he is wholly and undividedly; for he dwells wholly in God in virtue of his restful fruition and wholly in himself in virtue of his active love. . This is the supreme summit of the inner life. This is the only kind of inaction the Gita recommends. It is action of the most tireless kind; the only thing inactive is the ego. To live without the daily sacrifice (yajna) of selfless service  to work just for oneself, or worse, to do nothing at all  is simply to be a thief (3:12). It is not possible to do nothing, Krishna says; the very nature of the mind is incessant activity. The Gitas goal is to harness this activity in selfless service, removing the poisonous agency of the ego: As long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward (18:11). Meister Eckhart explains, To be right, a person must do one of two things: either he must learn to have God in his work and hold fast to him there, or he must give up his work altogether. Since, however, man cannot live without activities that are both human and various, we must learn to keep God in everything we do, and whatever the job or place, keep on with him, letting nothing stand in our way. It would be difficult to find a better summary of the Gitas message anywhere  and this, incidentally, from someone considered to represent the path of knowledge. Krishna wraps all this up in one famous verse: Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve (18:66). Krishna is the Self; the words mean simply to cast aside external props and dependencies and rely on the Self alone, seeking strength nowhere but within. Why does selfless action lead to Self-realization? It is not a matter of good action being divinely rewarded. Self-realization is not some kind of compensation for good deeds. We can understand the dynamics if we remember that the Gitas emphasis is on the mind. Most human activity, good and bad, is tainted by ego-involvement. Such activity cannot purify consciousness, because it goes on generating new karma in the mind  in  \fpractical terms, we go on getting entangled in what we do. Selfless work purifies consciousness because when there is no trace of ego involvement, new karma is not produced; the mind is simply working out the karma it has already accumulated. Shankara illustrates this with the simile of a potters wheel. The egos job is to go on incessantly spinning the wheel of the mind and making karmapots: new ideas to act on, fresh desires to pursue. When this pointless activity stops, no more pots are made, but for a while the wheel of the mind goes on spinning out of the momentum of its past karma. This is an anguishing period in the life of every mystic: you have done everything you can; now you can only wait with a kind of impatient patience. Eventually, for no reason that one can understand, the wheel does come to a stop, dissolving the mind-process in samadhi. A HIGHER IMAGE  Perhaps the clearest way to grasp the Gita is to look at the way it describes those who embody its teachings. There are portraits like this at the beginning of the Gita, the middle, and the end, each offering a model of our full human potential. The first is given at the end of chapter 2 (2:5472), verses which Gandhi said hold the key to the entire Gita. Arjuna has just been told about Selfknowledge; now he asks a very practical question: when a person attains this knowledge, how does it show? How do such people conduct themselves in everyday life? We expect a list of virtues. Instead, Krishna delivers a surprise: the surest sign is that they have banished all selfish desires. Their senses and mind are completely trained, so they are free from sensory cravings and self-will. Identified completely with the Self, not with body or mind, they realize their immortality here on earth. The implications of this are not spelled out; we have to see them in a living person. G. K. Chesterton once said that to understand the Sermon on the Mount, we should look not at Christ but at St. Francis. To understand the Gita I went to look at Mahatma Gandhi, who had done his best for forty years to translate those verses into his daily life. Seeing him, I understood that those who see themselves in all and all in them would simply not be capable of harming others. Augustine says daringly, Love, then do as you like: nothing will come out of you but goodness. I saw too what it meant to view ones body with detachment: not indifference, but compassionate care  \fas an instrument of service. I saw what it means to rest in the midst of intense action. Most important, I grasped one of the most refreshing ideas in Hindu mysticism: original goodness. Since the Self is the core of every personality, no one needs to acquire goodness or compassion; they are already there. All that is necessary is to remove the selfish habits that hide them. Chapter 12 gives another portrait in its closing verses (12:1320), and here we do get an inspiring list of the marks of those who follow the path of love: That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure and pain, patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me  with such as these I am in love. (12:1314) And finally comes the passionate description with which the Gita ends, when Krishna tells Arjuna how to recognize the man or woman who has reached lifes supreme goal: One who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action. Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom. (18:4950) These are not separate paths, separate ideals. All three passages describe one person: vital, active, compassionate, self-reliant in the highest sense, for he looks to the Self for everything and needs nothing from life but the opportunity to give. In brief, such a person knows who he is, and in that knowing is everything. This is not running away from life, as is so often claimed. It is running into life, open-handed, open-armed: flying, running, and rejoicing, says Thomas  Kempis, for he is free and will not be bound, never entangled in self-doubts, conflict, or vacillation. Far from being desireless  look at Gandhi, St. Catherine of Siena, St. Teresa, St. Francis  the man or woman who realizes God has yoked all human passions to the overriding desire to give and love and serve; and in that unification we can see, not the  \fextinction of personality, but its full blossoming. This is what it means to be fully human; our ordinary lives of stimulus and response, getting and spending, seem by comparison as faint as remembered dreams. This flowering of the spirit appeals, I think, to everyone. This is the true joy in life, says Bernard Shaw: the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; . . the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. Instead of Nature with a capital N, of course, the Gita would say an instrument of the Self; but that is the only difference. One of the most appealing features of the Gita for our times is that it clears up misunderstandings about the spiritual life and shows it for what it is: active, joyful, intentional, a middle path between extremes that transfigures everyday living. FAITH AND SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION  One last untranslatable concept and I will let the Gita speak for itself. That concept is shraddha, and its nearest English equivalent is faith. I have translated it as such, but shraddha means much more. It is literally that which is placed in the heart: all the beliefs we hold so deeply that we never think to question them. It is the set of values, axioms, prejudices, and prepossessions that colors our perceptions, governs our thinking, dictates our responses, and shapes our lives, generally without our even being aware of its presence and power. This may sound philosophical, but shraddha is not an intellectual abstraction. It is our very substance. The Gita says, A person is what his shraddha is (17:3). The Bible uses almost the same words: As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. Shraddha reflects everything that we have made ourselves and points to what we have become. But there is nothing passive about shraddha. It is full of potency, for it prompts action, conditions behavior, and determines how we see and therefore respond to the world around us. When Norman Cousins talks about a belief system analogous to the bodys organ systems, that is one aspect of shraddha; he is referring to the  \fpower to heal or harm that is inherent in our ideas of ourselves. One person with a serious illness believes he has a contribution to make to the world and so he recovers; another believes his life is worthless and he dies: that is the power of shraddha. Similarly, self-image is part of shraddha. One person believes she will succeed in life and overcomes great obstacles; another, who believes she can do nothing, may be more gifted and face fewer difficulties but accomplish very little. Yet shraddha is not brute determination or wishful thinking. When St. John of the Cross says We live in what we love, he is explaining shraddha. This is our world. Our lives are an eloquent expression of our belief: what we deem worth having, doing, attaining, being. What we strive for shows what we value; we back our shraddha with our time, our energy, our very lives. Thus shraddha determines destiny. As the Buddha puts it, All that we are is the result of what we have thought. We are made of our thoughts; we are molded by our thoughts. As we think, so we become. This is true not only of individuals but of societies, institutions, and civilizations, according to the dominant ideas that shape their actions. Faith in technology, for example, is part of the shraddha of modern civilization. Right shraddha, according to the Gita, is faith in spiritual laws: in the unity of life, the presence of divinity in every person, the essentially spiritual nature of the human being. Wrong shraddha is not necessarily morally wrong, merely ignorant. It means believing that there is no more to life than physical existence, that the human being is only a biochemical entity, that happiness can be got by pursuing private interests and ignoring the rest of life. Such beliefs are misplaced: we have attached our shraddha to beliefs that life cannot bear out. Sooner or later they must prove false, and then our shraddha changes. Like our thinking, therefore  like we ourselves  shraddha evolves. The purpose of karma is to teach the consequences of shraddha, so that by trial and error, life after life, the individual soul acquires the kind of faith that leads to fulfillment of lifes supreme goal. Krishna explains the dynamics: When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that. Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. (7:21 22)  \fThis is perhaps the most compassionate insight into human evolution ever expressed. The Gita is steeped in it, but it is not exclusive to the Gita or to Hinduism. Whether you like it or not, whether you know it or not, says Meister Eckhart, secretly Nature seeks and hunts and tries to ferret out the track in which God may be found. The whole purpose of every experience, every activity, every faculty, is to turn the human being inward and lead each of us back to our divine source. Thus every person seeking satisfaction in the world outside  pleasure, power, profit, prestige  is really looking for God: As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me (4:11). Two forces pervade human life, the Gita says: the upward thrust of evolution and the downward pull of our evolutionary past. Ultimately, then, the Gita is not a book of commandments but a book of choices. It does mention sin, but mostly it talks about ignorance and its consequences. Krishna tells Arjuna about the Self, the forces of the mind, the relationship between thought and action, the law of karma, and then concludes, Now, Arjuna, reflect on these words and then do as you choose (18:63). The struggle is between two halves of human nature, and choices are posed every moment. Everyone who has accepted this challenge, I think, will testify that life offers no fiercer battle than this war within. We have no choice about the fighting; it is built into human nature. But we do have the choice of which side to fight on: Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. If you egotistically say, I will not fight this battle, your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. (18:5859) Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. (8:7) Thus the Gita places human destiny entirely in human hands. Its world is not deterministic, but neither is it an expression of blind chance: we shape ourselves and our world by what we believe and think and act on, whether for good or for ill. In this sense the Gita opens not on Kurukshetra but on dharmakshetra, the field of dharma, where Arjuna and Krishna are standing for us all.  \fChapter One  The War Within Sri Krishna consoles and instructs Prince Arjuna as he is about to go into battle against family and friends to defend his older brothers claim to the ancient throne of the Kurus. Thus the great scripture called Bhagavad Gita, the Song of the Lord, begins. Sri Krishna is Bhagavan, the Lord, the mysterious incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the aspect of God who fosters and preserves the universe against the forces constantly working to destroy and corrupt it. Krishna has appeared on earth as a royal prince of the house of the Yadavas; thus he combines earthly majesty with a hidden spiritual power. Most know him only as an unimportant prince, but the wise have seen him reveal his power to destroy evil and protect the good. The battle of the Bhagavad Gita is not Krishnas fight, however; it is Arjunas. Krishna is only Arjunas charioteer and advisor. He has promised Arjuna that he will be with him throughout the ordeal, but much as he passionately hopes for Arjunas victory, he has sworn to be a noncombatant in the struggle. A charioteers position is a lowly one compared to the status and glory of the warrior he drives, but Krishna assumes this modest role out of love for Arjuna. As charioteer, he is in a perfect position to give advice and encouragement to Arjuna without violating his promise not to join the fight himself. To secure their claim to the throne, Arjuna and his brothers must fight not an alien army but their own cousins, who have held the kingdom for many years. Tragically, the forces against them include their own uncle, the blind king Dhritarashtra, and even the revered teachers and elders who guided Arjuna and his brothers when they were young. Arjuna, of course, wants to win the throne for his brother, who is the rightful heir to the Kuru dynasty and has endured many wrongs. But he is dismayed at the prospect of fighting his own people. Thus, on the morning the great battle is to begin, he turns to Krishna, his friend and spiritual advisor, and asks him the deeper questions about life that he has never asked before. The Bhagavad Gita is Krishnas answer. Other warriors who appear elsewhere in the drama are mentioned in this first chapter of the Gita. To Indians these are familiar figures from the  \flegendary past, but to most Western readers they will be unknown and even unpronounceable names. Arjuna and his brothers are known as the Pandavas, the sons of Pandu: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Sahadeva, and Nakula. The other side is called the Kauravas, the sons of Kuru. This is somewhat misleading, for both sides of the royal family are Kurus by birth. But the Pandavas are now in the position of appearing to be the dissident faction, so they are called sons of Pandu to distinguish them from the larger family. Pandu was once king of the kingdom of Hastinapura, but he retired into the forest on spiritual retreat and died young. His elder brother, Dhritarashtra, was blind since birth, so he was never named ruler, but he did share power with his brother. When Pandu died his eldest son, Yudhishthira, should have succeeded him; but because Yudhishthira was only a boy, Dhritarashtra continued on after Pandus death. As time passed, however, Dhritarashtras attachment to his own eldest son, Duryodhana, gradually overcame him. Instead of rising to royal impartiality and allowing Yudhishthira his fair claim, the old, blind king began to connive at his sons demand to succeed to the throne. Actually, the line of succession had grown convoluted over several generations, and it was not unthinkable that Duryodhana should rule next. But Yudhishthiras outstanding qualities and Duryodhanas corruption gradually decided the issue, at least from the moral point of view. For Duryodhana, the conflict could be resolved only on the battlefield. Other warriors are mentioned briefly in chapter 1. Two particularly important figures in the Mahabharata story are Drona and Bhishma. Drona was born a brahmin, a member of the priestly caste, but in search of wealth he took up the way of the warrior and excelled in the knowledge of arms. He was the teacher, the guru, of all the royal princes in their youth, the sons of Pandu and the sons of Dhritarashtra alike. Thus it was he who taught both sides the skills of war  an irony which sharp-tongued Duryodhana points out in verse 3. Arjuna was Dronas best pupil when it came to the bow, excelling even Dronas own son, Ashvatthama. Bhishma, the grandsire of both sides, is not actually the princes grandfather but a respected elder statesman. As Dhritarashtras advisor of many years standing, he considers it his duty to stand by his king and try to protect him from his weaknesses and wrong decisions.  \fAnother figure introduced in chapter 1 is Sanjaya, who narrates the entire Gita to the blind king Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya is not present on the battlefield, but the text tells us that the sage Vyasa, the composer of the Gita, has given him divine sight so that he can see and report everything. Chapter 1 leaves us acutely aware that we are on a battlefield, waiting for a catastrophic war to begin; but once Krishna begins his instruction, we leave the battlefield behind and enter the realms of philosophy and mystical vision. The first chapter is but a bridge to the real subjects of the Gita, and thus need not detain us too long in our study of the poem. Yet the first chapter has caused a great deal of debate, largely because of what it has to say about the morality of war. Basically there have been two points of view, which are almost (but perhaps not completely) irreconcilable. First, there is the orthodox Hindu viewpoint that the Gita condones war for the warrior class: it is the dharma, the moral duty, of soldiers to fight in a good cause, though never for evil leaders. (It should be added that this is part of an elaborate and highly chivalrous code prescribing the just rules of war.) According to this orthodox view, the lesson of the Mahabharata (and therefore of the Gita) is that although war is evil, it is an evil that cannot be avoided  an evil both tragic and honorable for the warrior himself. War in a just cause, justly waged, is also in accord with the divine will. Because of this, in the Mahabharata, Yudhishthira and his noble brothers find their peace in the next world when they have finished their duty on earth. The mystics point of view is more subtle. For them the battle is an allegory, a cosmic struggle between good and evil. Krishna has revealed himself on earth to reestablish righteousness, and he is asking Arjuna to engage in a spiritual struggle, not a worldly one. According to this interpretation, Arjuna is asked to fight not his kith and kin but his own lower self. Mahatma Gandhi, who based his daily life on the Gita from his twenties on, felt it would be impossible to live the kind of life taught in the Gita and still engage in violence. To argue that the Gita condones violence, he said, was to give importance only to its opening verses  its preface, so to speak  and ignore the scripture itself. For some, it helps clarify this question to look upon the Gita as an Upanishad, a mystical statement from the Vedas, that was incorporated into the warrior epic of a later age. Chapter 1 of the Gita then forms a rather  \fperilous bridge between the warriors world and the essential part of the Gita  Sri Krishnas revelations of spiritual truth.   \f1: The War Within DHRITARASHTRA  O Sanjaya, tell me what happened at Kurukshetra, the field of dharma, where my family and the Pandavas gathered to fight. 1  SANJAYA  Having surveyed the forces of the Pandavas arrayed for battle, prince Duryodhana approached his teacher, Drona, and spoke. 3 O my teacher, look at this mighty army of the Pandavas, assembled by your own gifted disciple, Yudhishthira. 4 There are heroic warriors and great archers who are the equals of Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana, Virata, the mighty Drupada, 5 Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja,the great leader Shaibya, 6 the powerful Yudhamanyu, the valiant Uttamaujas, and the son of Subhadra, in addition to the sons of Draupadi. All these command mighty chariots. 2  O best of brahmins, listen to the names of those who are distinguished among our own forces: 8 Bhishma, Karna, and the victorious Kripa; Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta. 7  There are many others, too, heroes giving up their lives for my sake, all proficient in war and armed with a variety of weapons. 10 Our army is unlimited and commanded by Bhishma; theirs is small and commanded by Bhima. 11 Let everyone take his proper place and stand firm supporting Bhishma! 9  Then the powerful Bhishma, the grandsire, oldest of all the Kurus, in order to cheer Duryodhana, roared like a lion and blew his 12  \fconch horn. 13 And after Bhishma, a tremendous noise arose of conchs and cow horns and pounding on drums. Then Sri Krishna and Arjuna, who were standing in a mighty chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conchs. 15 Sri Krishna blew the conch named Panchajanya, and Arjuna blew that called Devadatta. The mighty Bhima blew the huge conch Paundra. 16 Yudhishthira, the king, the son of Kunti, blew the conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conchs as well. 17 Then the king of Kashi, the leading bowman, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the invincible Satyaki, 18 Drupada, all the sons of Draupadi, and the strong-armed son of Subhadra joined in, 19 and the noise tore through the heart of Duryodhanas army. Indeed, the sound was tumultuous, echoing throughout heaven and earth. 14  Then, O Dhritarashtra, lord of the earth, having seen your sons forces set in their places and the fighting about to begin, Arjuna spoke these words to Sri Krishna: 20  ARJUNA  O Krishna, drive my chariot between the two armies. 22 I want to see those who desire to fight with me. With whom will this battle be fought? 23 I want to see those assembled to fight for Duryodhana, those who seek to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra by engaging in war. 21  SANJAYA  Thus Arjuna spoke, and Sri Krishna, driving his splendid chariot between the two armies, 25 facing Bhishma and Drona and all the kings of the earth, said: Arjuna, behold all the Kurus gathered together. 24  And Arjuna, standing between the two armies, saw fathers and grandfathers, teachers, uncles, and brothers, sons and grandsons, 27 in-laws and friends. Seeing his kinsmen established in opposition, 28 Arjuna was overcome by sorrow. Despairing, he spoke these words: 26  \fARJUNA  O Krishna, I see my own relations here anxious to fight, 29 and my limbs grow weak; my mouth is dry, my body shakes, and my hair is standing on end. 30 My skin burns, and the bow Gandiva has slipped from my hand. I am unable to stand; my mind seems to be whirling. 31 These signs bode evil for us. I do not see that any good can come from killing our relations in battle. 32 O Krishna, I have no desire for victory, or for a kingdom or pleasures. Of what use is a kingdom or pleasure or even life, 33 if those for whose sake we desire these things  34 teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, in-laws, grandsons, and others with family ties  are engaging in this battle, renouncing their wealth and their lives? 35 Even if they were to kill me, I would not want to kill them, not even to become ruler of the three worlds. How much less for the earth alone? O Krishna, what satisfaction could we find in killing Dhritarashtras sons? We would become sinners by slaying these men, even though they are evil. 37 The sons of Dhritarashtra are related to us; therefore, we should not kill them. How can we gain happiness by killing members of our own family? 36  Though they are overpowered by greed and see no evil in destroying families or injuring friends, we see these evils. 39 Why shouldnt we turn away from this sin? 40 When a family declines, ancient traditions are destroyed. With them are lost the spiritual foundations for life, and the family loses its sense of unity. 41 Where there is no sense of unity, the women of the family become corrupt; and with the corruption of its women, society is plunged into chaos. 42 Social chaos is hell for the family and for those who have destroyed the family as well. It disrupts the process of spiritual evolution begun by our ancestors. 43 The timeless spiritual foundations of family and society would be destroyed by these terrible deeds, which violate the unity of life. 38  It is said that those whose family dharma has been destroyed dwell in hell. 45 This is a great sin! We are prepared to kill our own relations out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. 46 Better for 44  \fme if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, were to attack me in battle and kill me unarmed and unresisting. SANJAYA  Overwhelmed by sorrow, Arjuna spoke these words. And casting away his bow and his arrows, he sat down in his chariot in the middle of the battlefield. 47  \fChapter Two  Self-Realization As Arjunas spiritual teacher, Sri Krishnas task now is to rouse Arjuna from his despair and set him on the way to Self-realization. Arjuna is essentially a man of action, renowned for his bravery, nobility, and skill in the arts of war  intelligent, but not given to reflection. Yet in his present crisis, he finds that the active life is not enough. He is forced to ask the perennial questions about life and death: Does he have a soul? Does it survive death? Is there a deeper reality than we perceive in the world around us? If so, is it possible to know it directly, and (for Arjuna is always practical) what effect does such knowing have in everyday life? In his answer, Krishna touches on almost all the main themes and concepts of the Gita. Chapter 2 is thus a kind of overview of the sixteen chapters to come. Sri Krishna begins by reminding Arjuna of his immortal nature: his real Self, the Atman, never dies, for it is never born; it is eternal. Thus the Gita does not lead us from stage to stage of spiritual awareness, but begins with the ultimate premise: the immortal soul is more important than the passing world. Knowing he is out of his depth in these inner realms of the mind and spirit, Arjuna formally asks Krishna to be his spiritual teacher or guru. This is a basic prerequisite of a disciples initiation in the Hindu tradition, where it is believed that virtually all seekers need the guidance of an experienced teacher. Arjuna is no exception, and he is fortunate to have Krishna himself as his guru. In the allegorical sense, Krishna is a symbol of the Atman, Arjunas deepest Self. This chapter introduces the idea of rebirth or samsara. The Self wears the body as a garment; when the garment is old, it is cast aside and a new one is put on. Thus the soul, or jiva, travels from life to life. Just as death is certain for the living, rebirth is certain for the dead. Krishna assures Arjuna that his basic nature is not subject to time and death; yet he reminds him that he cannot realize this truth if he cannot see beyond the dualities of life: pleasure and pain, success and failure, even heat and cold. The Gita does not teach a spirituality aimed at an enjoyable life in the hereafter, nor does it  \fteach a way to enhance power in this life or the next. It teaches a basic detachment from pleasure and pain, as this chapter says more than once. Only in this way can an individual rise above the conditioning of lifes dualities and identify with the Atman, the immortal Self. Also, the Gita does not teach an enlightenment based on a knowledge of the scriptures. The important thing is direct mystical experience, which Krishna will later urge Arjuna to acquire for himself. This chapter establishes the various definitions of yoga taught in the Gita. Here the word does not refer to the physical postures and exercises (hatha yoga) it connotes in the West; it refers primarily to disciplining the mind. Yoga is evenness of mind: detachment from the dualities of pain and pleasure, success and failure. Therefore yoga is skill in action, because this kind of detachment is required if one is to act in freedom, rather than merely react to events compelled by conditioning. Krishna is not trying to persuade Arjuna to lead a different kind of life and renounce the world as would a monk or recluse. He tells Arjuna that if he can establish himself in yoga  in unshakable equanimity, profound peace of mind  he will be more effective in the realm of action. His judgment will be better and his vision clear if he is not emotionally entangled in the outcome of what he does. Arjuna now asks his first question as Krishnas student. His teacher has been talking about spiritual wisdom: direct, experiential knowledge of the immortal Self. Arjuna wants to know what difference this kind of wisdom makes in everyday life. If a person establishes an ever-present awareness of the core of divinity within himself, how does it affect the way he lives? Arjuna is not interested in what people believe, but in how they conduct themselves in life. Krishnas answer (2:55 72 ) is one of the most quoted passages in the Gita. Mahatma Gandhi said these verses contain the essence of the Gita: if the rest of the scripture were lost, this passage alone would be enough to teach a complete way of life. Those who are established in wisdom (sthitaprajna) live in continuous, unbroken awareness that they are not the perishable body but the Atman. Further, they see the same Self in everyone, for the Atman is universally present in all. Such a one, Krishna says, does not identify with personal desires. These desires are on the surface of personality, and the Self is its very core. The Self-realized man or woman is not motivated by personal desires  in other words, by any desire for kama, personal satisfaction. This idea is perhaps  \fforeign to modern ways of thinking, but basic to the Gita  and, indeed, to mystics of all traditions. More specifically, the word kama refers to any gratification of the ego or the senses that entangles us in the world of samsara, and thus draws us away from the core of our being, the Self. Those established in Selfrealization control their senses instead of letting their senses control them. If the senses are not controlled, Krishna warns, the mind (or emotions) will follow wherever they lead. Eventually a person following the senses loses strength of will and unity of purpose; his choices are dictated by his desires. When the will is led astray by the desire for pleasure, the mind becomes confused and scattered. Ultimately, Krishna warns, this leads to spiritual destruction: When you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste. (2:62 63 ) Yet the Gita does not recommend asceticism. It is more a matter of training the body, mind, and senses. At the very close of the chapter, Krishna introduces the idea that it is not enough to master all selfish desires; it is also necessary to subdue possessiveness and egocentricity. If this ultimate bourne can be passed, then the seeker will know the true, immortal Self within. This is the mystics supreme goal: knowing their real nature, they know their own immortality and realize their union with eternal Being.   \f2: Self-Realization SANJAYA  These are the words that Sri Krishna spoke to the despairing Arjuna, whose eyes were burning with tears of pity and confusion. 1  KRISHNA  This despair and weakness in a time of crisis are mean and unworthy of you, Arjuna. How have you fallen into a state so far from the path to liberation? 3 It does not become you to yield to this weakness. Arise with a brave heart and destroy the enemy. 2  ARJUNA  How can I ever bring myself to fight against Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of reverence? How can I, Krishna? 5 Surely it would be better to spend my life begging than to kill these great and worthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would be tainted. 6 I dont even know which would be better, for us to conquer them or for them to conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashtra have confronted us; but why would we care to live if we killed them? 4  My will is paralyzed, and I am utterly confused. Tell me which is the better path for me. Let me be your disciple. I have fallen at your feet; give me instruction. 8 What can overcome a sorrow that saps all my vitality? Even power over men and gods or the wealth of an empire seem empty. 7  SANJAYA  \fThis is how Arjuna, the great warrior, spoke to Sri Krishna. With the words, O Krishna, I will not fight, he fell silent. 10 As they stood between the two armies, Sri Krishna smiled and replied to Arjuna, who had sunk into despair. 9  KRISHNA  You speak sincerely, but your sorrow has no cause. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. 12 There has never been a time when you and I and the kings gathered here have not existed, nor will there be a time when we will cease to exist. 13 As the same person inhabits the body through childhood, youth, and old age, so too at the time of death he attains another body. The wise are not deluded by these changes. 11  When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. 15 Those who are unaffected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. Assert your strength and realize this! 14  The impermanent has no reality; reality lies in the eternal. Those who have seen the boundary between these two have attained the end of all knowledge. 17 Realize that which pervades the universe and is indestructible; no power can affect this unchanging, imperishable reality. 18 The body is mortal, but that which dwells in the body is immortal and immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, fight in this battle. 16  One believes he is the slayer, another believes he is the slain. Both are ignorant; there is neither slayer nor slain. 20 You were never born; you will never die. You have never changed; you can never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, you do not die when the body dies. 21 Realizing that which is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and unchanging, how can you slay or cause another to slay? 19  \fAs one abandons worn-out clothes and acquires new ones, so when the body is worn out a new one is acquired by the Self, who lives within. 22  The Self cannot be pierced by weapons or burned by fire; water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it. 24 The Self cannot be pierced or burned, made wet or dry. It is everlasting and infinite, standing on the motionless foundations of eternity. 25 The Self is unmanifested, beyond all thought, beyond all change. Knowing this, you should not grieve. 23  O mighty Arjuna, even if you believe the Self to be subject to birth and death, you should not grieve. 27 Death is inevitable for the living; birth is inevitable for the dead. Since these are unavoidable, you should not sorrow. 28 Every creature is unmanifested at first and then attains manifestation. When its end has come, it once again becomes unmanifested. What is there to lament in this? 26  The glory of the Self is beheld by a few, and a few describe it; a few listen, but many without understanding. 30 The Self of all beings, living within the body, is eternal and cannot be harmed. Therefore, do not grieve. 29  Considering your dharma, you should not vacillate. For a warrior, nothing is higher than a war against evil. 32 The warrior confronted with such a war should be pleased, Arjuna, for it comes as an open gate to heaven. 33 But if you do not participate in this battle against evil, you will incur sin, violating your dharma and your honor. 31  The story of your dishonor will be repeated endlessly: and for a man of honor, dishonor is worse than death. 35 These brave warriors will think you have withdrawn from battle out of fear, and those who formerly esteemed you will treat you with disrespect. 36 Your enemies will ridicule your strength and say things that should not be said. What could be more painful than this? 34  Death means the attainment of heaven; victory means the enjoyment of the earth. Therefore rise up, Arjuna, resolved to fight! 37  \fHaving made yourself alike in pain and pleasure, profit and loss, victory and defeat, engage in this great battle and you will be freed from sin. 38  You have heard the intellectual explanation of Sankhya, Arjuna; now listen to the principles of yoga. By practicing these you can break through the bonds of karma. 40 On this path effort never goes to waste, and there is no failure. Even a little effort toward spiritual awareness will protect you from the greatest fear. 39  Those who follow this path, resolving deep within themselves to seek me alone, attain singleness of purpose. For those who lack resolution, the decisions of life are many-branched and endless. 41  There are ignorant people who speak flowery words and take delight in the letter of the law, saying that there is nothing else. 43 Their hearts are full of selfish desires, Arjuna. Their idea of heaven is their own enjoyment, and the aim of all their activities is pleasure and power. The fruit of their actions is continual rebirth. 44 Those whose minds are swept away by the pursuit of pleasure and power are incapable of following the supreme goal and will not attain samadhi. 42  The scriptures describe the three gunas. But you should be free from the action of the gunas, established in eternal truth, selfcontrolled, without any sense of duality or the desire to acquire and hoard. 45  Just as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is flooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined man or woman, who sees the Lord everywhere. 46  You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. 48 Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself  without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. 47  \fSeek refuge in the attitude of detachment and you will amass the wealth of spiritual awareness. Those who are motivated only by desire for the fruits of action are miserable, for they are constantly anxious about the results of what they do. 50 When consciousness is unified, however, all vain anxiety is left behind. There is no cause for worry, whether things go well or ill. Therefore, devote yourself to the disciplines of yoga, for yoga is skill in action. 49  The wise unify their consciousness and abandon attachment to the fruits of action, which binds a person to continual rebirth. Thus they attain a state beyond all evil. 51  When your mind has overcome the confusion of duality, you will attain the state of holy indifference to things you hear and things you have heard. 53 When you are unmoved by the confusion of ideas and your mind is completely united in deep samadhi, you will attain the state of perfect yoga. 52  ARJUNA  Tell me of those who live established in wisdom, ever aware of the Self, O Krishna. How do they talk? How sit? How move about? 54  KRISHNA  They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them, who have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving tormenting the heart. 55  Neither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live free from lust and fear and anger. Established in meditation, they are truly wise. 57 Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are neither elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. Such are the seers. 56  Even as a tortoise draws in its limbs, the wise can draw in their senses at will. 59 Aspirants abstain from sense pleasures, but they still crave for them. These cravings all disappear when they see the highest goal. 60 Even of those who tread the path, the stormy senses 58  \fcan sweep off the mind. 61 They live in wisdom who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in me. When you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. 63 Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste. 64 But when you move amidst the world of sense, free from attachment and aversion alike, 65 there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you live in the wisdom of the Self. 62  The disunited mind is far from wise; how can it meditate? How be at peace? When you know no peace, how can you know joy? 67 When you let your mind follow the call of the senses, they carry away your better judgment as storms drive a boat off its charted course on the sea. 66  Use all your power to free the senses from attachment and aversion alike, and live in the full wisdom of the Self. 69 Such a sage awakes to light in the night of all creatures. That which the world calls day is the night of ignorance to the wise. 68  As rivers flow into the ocean but cannot make the vast ocean overflow, so flow the streams of the sense-world into the sea of peace that is the sage. But this is not so with the desirer of desires. 70  They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away from the ego-cage of I, me, and mine to be united with the Lord. 72 This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality. 71  \fChapter Three  Selfless Service The title of this chapter in Sanskrit is Karma Yoga, The Way of Action, and here we take an apparently sharp turn away from the subject of the previous chapter. In fact, Arjuna changes the subject completely. Krishna has been trying to convince him that he has an immortal soul, but Arjuna continues to worry about his immediate predicament. It is not that he is uninterested in mystical enlightenment, but his main concern at the moment is just what he is supposed to do next. Or, he asks, perhaps what he does is not so important after all. Has Krishna been telling him to concentrate on acquiring spiritual wisdom and to forget about his apparent duties in the world? Krishna replies that there is no way Arjuna can avoid the obligation of selfless action, or karma yoga. Arjuna must act selflessly, out of a sense of duty. He must work not for his own sake, but for the welfare of all. Krishna points out that this is a basic law underlying all creation. Each being must do its part in the grand scheme of things, and there is no way to avoid this obligation  except perhaps by the complete enlightenment which loosens all the old bonds of karma. Here the Gita refers to the doctrine of karma, one of the basic teachings in all Hindu and Buddhist scriptures. Karma literally means deed or action; what is sometimes called the law of karma refers to an underlying law of cause and effect that is seen to permeate all existence. The idea is that every action leads to a reasonable result  and, consequently, that everything that happens can be traced to something done in the past. Actions determine destiny: this is the basic idea of karma. If anything happens to us that is truly good, we must have done something in the past to deserve it; if something ill befalls us, then at some time in the past we did something that was not so meritorious. This is a basic moral law that all great spiritual traditions share: the belief that we reap what we sow. The Hindu tradition gave a great deal of thought to this problem of moral cause and effect, and generation after generation of spiritual teachers fathomed its depths and implications. One fear that developed over time was that all action was in a sense an open door to bondage: anything a  \fperson did would bind him to the endless cycle of cause and effect. Some fruits of action would of course be pleasant  not all karma is painful. But even this pleasure could be a trap, because we would seek it compulsively, tying ourselves tighter and tighter to the responsibilities and opportunities of the worldly life and forgetting our spiritual dimension altogether. In chapter 3 Krishna begins to tell Arjuna the way out of this maze of cause and effect. It is not to avoid work, especially the duties required by his station in life, but to perform those duties without selfish attachment to their fruit, or outcome. If Arjuna follows this path of selfless work, Krishna explains, he will enjoy this world as well as the next. More important, he will gain a spiritual blessing and will be lessening his debt of karma. Only when he is free from every bond of karma  every consequence of past action  can he achieve lifes ultimate goal. The world is bound in its own activity, for all creatures except the illumined man or woman work for their own pleasure and gain. Because they act selfishly, they are bound by the results, whether good or bad. We must act in a selfless spirit, Krishna says, without ego-involvement and without getting entangled in whether things work out the way we want; only then will we not fall into the terrible net of karma. We cannot hope to escape karma by refraining from our duties: even to survive in the world, we must act. True, the Hindu scriptures do hold out another path  jnana yoga, the path of wisdom  which does not enjoin action. But Krishna does not really offer this to Arjuna as an alternative; it is acknowledged and then dropped. Perhaps Krishna knows that Arjuna is not the type to disengage himself and go off on a search for the mystical vision. For Arjuna, the active life is essential. The danger, of course, of a life of active engagement in the world is that Arjuna will get caught up in his actions and begin to act out of selfish motives. If this were to happen, he would be doomed to spiritual failure. Having a good deal of self-knowledge, Arjuna senses this danger. He asks Krishna a fundamental question: What power binds us to our selfish ways? Even if we wish to act rightly, so often we do the wrong thing. What power moves us? Krishna replies that anger and selfish desire are our greatest enemies. They are the destructive powers that can compel us to wander away from our purpose, to end up in self-delusion and despair.  \fHere it is necessary to introduce two technical terms from Hindu philosophy. The Gita is not an academic work of philosophy, but a poetic, practical text. Still, it does refer from time to time to Sankhya, one of the six traditional schools of Indian philosophy. In Sankhya, the phenomenal world of mind and matter is described as having three basic qualities or gunas: sattva goodness, light, purity; rajas passion, activity, energy; and tamas darkness, ignorance, inertia. According to Sankhya, spiritual evolution progresses from tamas to rajas to sattva, and final liberation takes the soul beyond the three gunas altogether. Here Krishna warns Arjuna to beware the pitfalls of rajas, for it is from rajas that anger and selfish desire arise. Arjuna must realize that his true nature, the Atman, is above entanglement in the gunas. The gunas act and react upon one another, but Arjunas inner being is not affected. If he cannot reach this detachment, he will be always caught in the emotional storms of passion (rajas) or the quagmires of inertia (tamas) which alternate in dominating the mind and body. Krishna offers Arjuna the example of King Janaka, well known from holy legend, as a model for the princely estate. Janaka was a king who ruled well and did not shirk his responsibilities, yet he was detached and worked from a sense of duty, not for personal gain or enjoyment. He was revered as a royal sage who pursued his enlightenment not by renouncing the world, but by working in it and contributing to its welfare, thus enjoying the best of both worlds.   \f3: Selfless Service ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have said that knowledge is greater than action; why then do you ask me to wage this terrible war? 2 Your advice seems inconsistent. Give me one path to follow to the supreme good. 1  KRISHNA  At the beginning of time I declared two paths for the pure heart: jnana yoga, the contemplative path of spiritual wisdom, and karma yoga, the active path of selfless service. 3  One who shirks action does not attain freedom; no one can gain perfection by abstaining from work. 5 Indeed, there is no one who rests for even an instant; all creatures are driven to action by their own nature. 4  Those who abstain from action while allowing the mind to dwell on sensual pleasure cannot be called sincere spiritual aspirants. 7 But they excel who control their senses through the mind, using them for selfless service. 6  Fulfill all your duties; action is better than inaction. Even to maintain your body, Arjuna, you are obliged to act. 9 Selfish action imprisons the world. Act selflessly, without any thought of personal profit. 8  At the beginning, mankind and the obligation of selfless service were created together. Through selfless service, you will always be 10  \ffruitful and find the fulfillment of your desires: this is the promise of the Creator. Honor and cherish the devas as they honor and cherish you; through this honor and love you will attain the supreme good. 12 All human desires are fulfilled by the devas, who are pleased by selfless service. But anyone who enjoys the things given by the devas without offering selfless acts in return is a thief. 11  The spiritually minded, who eat in the spirit of service, are freed from all their sins; but the selfish, who prepare food for their own satisfaction, eat sin. 14 Living creatures are nourished by food, and food is nourished by rain; rain itself is the water of life, which comes from selfless worship and service. 13  Every selfless act, Arjuna, is born from Brahman, the eternal, infinite Godhead. Brahman is present in every act of service. 16 All life turns on this law, O Arjuna. Those who violate it, indulging the senses for their own pleasure and ignoring the needs of others, have wasted their life. 17 But those who realize the Self are always satisfied. Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no longer seek happiness from the external world. 18 They have nothing to gain or lose by any action; neither people nor things can affect their security. 15  Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. 20 Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path. 19  What the outstanding person does, others will try to do. The standards such people create will be followed by the whole world. 22 There is nothing in the three worlds for me to gain, Arjuna, nor is there anything I do not have; I continue to act, but I am not driven by any need of my own. 23 If I ever refrained from continuous work, everyone would immediately follow my example. 24 If I stopped working I would be the cause of cosmic chaos, and finally of the destruction of this world and these people. 21  \fThe ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare of the world, without thought for themselves. 26 By abstaining from work you will confuse the ignorant, who are engrossed in their actions. Perform all work carefully, guided by compassion. 25  All actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti. Deluded by identification with the ego, a person thinks, I am the doer. 28 But the illumined man or woman understands the domain of the gunas and is not attached. Such people know that the gunas interact with each other; they do not claim to be the doer. 27  Those who are deluded by the operation of the gunas become attached to the results of their action. Those who understand these truths should not unsettle the ignorant. 30 Performing all actions for my sake, completely absorbed in the Self, and without expectations, fight!  but stay free from the fever of the ego. 29  Those who live in accordance with these divine laws without complaining, firmly established in faith, are released from karma. 32 Those who violate these laws, criticizing and complaining, are utterly deluded, and are the cause of their own suffering. 31  Even the wise act within the limitations of their own nature. Every creature is subject to prakriti; what is the use of repression? 34 The senses have been conditioned by attraction to the pleasant and aversion to the unpleasant. Do not be ruled by them; they are obstacles in your path. 33  It is better to strive in ones own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following ones own dharma, but competition in anothers dharma breeds fear and insecurity. 35  ARJUNA  What is the force that binds us to selfish deeds, O Krishna? What power moves us, even against our will, as if forcing us? 36  \fKRISHNA  It is selfish desire and anger, arising from the guna of rajas; these are the appetites and evils which threaten a person in this life. 37  Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, just as the embryo rests deep within the womb, knowledge is hidden by selfish desire  39 hidden, Arjuna, by this unquenchable fire for self-satisfaction, the inveterate enemy of the wise. 38  Selfish desire is found in the senses, mind, and intellect, misleading them and burying the understanding in delusion. 41 Fight with all your strength, Arjuna! Controlling your senses, conquer your enemy, the destroyer of knowledge and realization. 40  The senses are higher than the body, the mind higher than the senses; above the mind is the intellect, and above the intellect is the Atman. 43 Thus, knowing that which is supreme, let the Atman rule the ego. Use your mighty arms to slay the fierce enemy that is selfish desire. 42  \fChapter Four  Wisdom in Action Krishna is eager to grant Arjuna knowledge of the highest spiritual truths, or even a rare mystical vision; but Arjuna has been asking for Krishna to simply get him out of his present difficulties. Of course these difficulties are not minor  he is caught in a family tragedy that has developed into a vicious conflict. If he cannot extricate himself, he knows that he will have to take part in a catastrophic battle that no one wants. So when Krishna begins to tell Arjuna about the secret teachings he will be privileged to hear because he is Krishnas favorite devotee and friend, it hardly registers in Arjunas consciousness. His reply is confused. How could you have taught any secret wisdom to the sages of old? he asks. At this point Krishna reminds Arjuna again of the process of rebirth. They have both been reborn many times, but naturally Arjuna does not remember his past lives because he has no access to this kind of knowledge. Krishna remembers his former births, but he is no ordinary being. He reveals that he has chosen to take on human birth many times for the welfare of the world. Whenever dharma, the law of lifes unity, declines, he wraps himself in his maya and takes on a finite form. Thus he returns age after age. Vishnu, the preserving or sustaining person of the Hindu Trinity, is not mentioned here, but Krishna is usually looked upon as an incarnation of this aspect of God. As the Lord, Krishna explains, he dwells in every being, but he is manifested with special power in his incarnations or avatars. Avatara literally means descent: Vishnu is believed to descend and incarnate himself on earth from age to age to reestablish divine law (dharma). Without such intervention the entire created universe would go into decline. The natural course of creation is to go through cycles of regeneration and decay, but Vishnu  Krishna  has compassion for all the suffering of the world, and comes himself to protect the good and destroy evil. Thus Vishnu has a special relationship with all beings: he personifies the aspect of God who so loves the world that he comes into it to reestablish the purity and happiness of the Golden Age.  \fKrishna here reveals a little of his hidden, divine nature. He tells Arjuna that mystical union with him is possible through devotion, by which one can enter the state of divine love in which one sees God in every creature. Krishna also takes on the role of creator. It is he who has patterned the world along the lines of guna and karma. This mystic aspect of Krishnas being dominates the Gita. In the Mahabharata, Krishna is a princely ally who is wise and daring in his support of his friend Arjuna. But the author of the Gita is not concerned with this Krishna; he turns his attention to the mystery of Krishnas divine nature as an aspect of Vishnu. In this sense Krishna is the inner Self in all beings. His name comes from the Sanskrit root krish, to draw to oneself, to attract. He is the attractive one, the Lord of loving attraction. By another etymology, the word Krishna means the dark one. The author of the Gita sees revealed in him the ultimate Godhead, the supreme being. But this reality is often veiled, and then Krishna is seen as an ordinary human being  or, rather, as an exceptionally gifted man, but not as God. Many of Krishnas words make most sense when we realize that when he speaks of himself, he is often not describing a transcendental reality so much as trying to tell Arjuna about the Self in every human being. When he says, for example, Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results, he means, Arjuna, actions do not cling to your real Self. The Self in us is not touched by action; whatever we do, it remains unsullied. Those who understand this  about themselves  and practice it live in freedom. The latter part of this chapter turns from lofty mystical topics back to Arjunas immediate problem. Krishna begins to talk about action, and work, and things that should be done and should not be done. It is essential, he reminds Arjuna, to act wisely, with detachment. The wise never act with selfish attachment to the fruit of their labor; they give their best in fortune and misfortune alike. Such people act in freedom. The next section deals with the various kinds of yajna  worship or offering  that may be performed by spiritual aspirants of differing temperaments. Hindu rituals often involve making an offering to the gods by pouring an oblation into the sacred fire. Here the image is the same: whatever is offered is symbolically thrown into a consuming fire that carries the offering to God. The offering may be as obvious as worldly goods, or as subtle as knowledge or meditation: in any case it requires a  \fmeasure of self-sacrifice. Yajna is a basic action, necessary to life, and those who do not perform some kind of selfless service find no home in this world or the next. The final verses of chapter 4 introduce a new principle. In the last chapter, Krishna mentioned the path of spiritual wisdom as an alternative to the path of action or karma yoga. Now he reveals that wisdom is the goal of selfless action: knowing is the fruit of doing. The goal of all karma yoga or yajna is liberation and spiritual wisdom. The fire of spiritual awareness burns to ashes even a great heap of karma; thus true knowledge is the greatest purifier of the soul. Krishna ends by exhorting Arjuna to cut through the doubts that still stifle him. This is the first  but not the last  mention that Krishna makes of Arjunas doubting heart. There has been no indication so far that Arjuna has taken in and accepted Krishnas words. But even though Arjuna continues to drag his feet, Krishna does not abandon him.   \f4: Wisdom in Action KRISHNA  I told this eternal secret to Vivasvat. Vivasvat taught Manu, and Manu taught Ikshvaku. 2 Thus, Arjuna, eminent sages received knowledge of yoga in a continuous tradition. But through time the practice of yoga was lost in the world. 1  The secret of these teachings is profound. I have explained them to you today because you are my friend and devotee. 3  ARJUNA  You were born much after Vivasvat; he lived very long ago. Why do you say that you taught this yoga in the beginning? 4  KRISHNA  You and I have passed through many births, Arjuna. You have forgotten, but I remember them all. 5  My true being is unborn and changeless. I am the Lord who dwells in every creature. Through the power of my own maya, I manifest myself in a finite form. 6  Whenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I manifest myself on earth. 8 I am born in every age to protect the good, to destroy evil, and to reestablish dharma. 7  Those who know me as their own divine Self break through the belief that they are the body and are not reborn as separate creatures. Such a one, Arjuna, is united with me. 10 Delivered from selfish 9  \fattachment, fear, and anger, filled with me, surrendering themselves to me, purified in the fire of my being, many have reached the state of unity in me. As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. 11  Those desiring success in their actions worship the gods; through action in the world of mortals, their desires are quickly fulfilled. 13 The distinctions of caste, guna, and karma have come from me. I am their cause, but I myself am changeless and beyond all action. 14 Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results. Those who understand this and practice it live in freedom. 15 Knowing this truth, aspirants desiring liberation in ancient times engaged in action. You too can do the same, pursuing an active life in the manner of those ancient sages. 12  What is action and what is inaction? This question has confused the greatest sages. I will give you the secret of action, with which you can free yourself from bondage. 17 The true nature of action is difficult to grasp. You must understand what is action and what is inaction, and what kind of action should be avoided. 16  The wise see that there is action in the midst of inaction and inaction in the midst of action. Their consciousness is unified, and every act is done with complete awareness. 18  The awakened sages call a person wise when all his undertakings are free from anxiety about results; all his selfish desires have been consumed in the fire of knowledge. 20 The wise, ever satisfied, have abandoned all external supports. Their security is unaffected by the results of their action; even while acting, they really do nothing at all. 21 Free from expectations and from all sense of possession, with mind and body firmly controlled by the Self, they do not incur sin by the performance of physical action. 19  They live in freedom who have gone beyond the dualities of life. Competing with no one, they are alike in success and failure and 22  \fcontent with whatever comes to them. 23 They are free, without selfish attachments; their minds are fixed in knowledge. They perform all work in the spirit of service, and their karma is dissolved. The process of offering is Brahman; that which is offered is Brahman. Brahman offers the sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. Brahman is attained by those who see Brahman in every action. 24  Some aspirants offer material sacrifices to the gods. Others offer selfless service as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. 26 Some renounce all enjoyment of the senses, sacrificing them in the fire of sense restraint. Others partake of sense objects but offer them in service through the fire of the senses. 27 Some offer the workings of the senses and the vital forces through the fire of self-control, kindled in the path of knowledge. 25  Some offer wealth; others offer sense restraint and suffering. Some take vows and offer knowledge and study of the scriptures; and some make the offering of meditation. 29 Some offer the forces of vitality, regulating their inhalation and exhalation, and thus gain control over these forces. 30 Others offer the forces of vitality through restraint of their senses. All these understand the meaning of service and will be cleansed of their impurities. 28  True sustenance is in service, and through it a man or woman reaches the eternal Brahman. But those who do not seek to serve are without a home in this world. Arjuna, how can they be at home in any world to come? 31  These offerings are born of work, and each guides mankind along a path to Brahman. Understanding this, you will attain liberation. 33 The offering of wisdom is better than any material offering, Arjuna; for the goal of all work is spiritual wisdom. 32  Approach those who have realized the purpose of life and question them with reverence and devotion; they will instruct you in 34  \fthis wisdom. 35 Once you attain it, you will never again be deluded. You will see all creatures in the Self, and all in me. Even if you were the most sinful of sinners, Arjuna, you could cross beyond all sin by the raft of spiritual wisdom. 37 As the heat of a fire reduces wood to ashes, the fire of knowledge burns to ashes all karma. 38 Nothing in this world purifies like spiritual wisdom. It is the perfection achieved in time through the path of yoga, the path which leads to the Self within. 36  Those who take wisdom as their highest goal, whose faith is deep and whose senses are trained, attain wisdom quickly and enter into perfect peace. 40 But the ignorant, indecisive and lacking in faith, waste their lives. They can never be happy in this world or any other. 39  Those established in the Self have renounced selfish attachments to their actions and cut through doubts with spiritual wisdom. They act in freedom. 42 Arjuna, cut through this doubt in your own heart with the sword of spiritual wisdom. Arise; take up the path of yoga! 41  \fChapter Five  Renounce & Rejoice At the beginning of this chapter, the traditional approach to the spiritual life  that is, leaving the world, retiring from the ordinary affairs of job and family  is contrasted with working in the world with detachment. The general term for retiring from the world is sannyasa, renunciation. Traditionally, sannyasa meant renouncing all worldly ties and attachments. The person undertaking the vow of sannyasa would leave home, family, and occupation to pursue a strict contemplative life. This was a path chosen by very few, even in ancient India. Yet we shouldnt forget that surprising numbers of people in traditional societies, both in the East and the West, have chosen a monastic life removed from the turmoil of the world. In India, the Compassionate Buddha provides the classic example of one who leaves the comforts and fulfillments of family and worldly life to seek the lonely way to Self-realization. The story is well known throughout Asia. Siddhartha Gautama was a prince with every worldly satisfaction within his reach, who left his palace to find a way to lead the world beyond suffering and death. He became a wandering sannyasi, a lonely, austere monk. Only after he had attained to complete enlightenment did he return to society, to teach others of the peace of nirvana. Though Krishna acknowledges here that this way of sannyasa can lead to the goal, he recommends the path of selfless action or selfless service as the better way. He contrasts the way of Sankhya  which in this context means knowledge of the Self in a general way  to the way of yoga, which here means the way of action. This term yoga presents difficulties in the Gita because it means different things at different times, and many definitions are given of this all-purpose term. But for several chapters the topic under discussion has been the active spiritual life, or karma yoga, and that is clearly what is meant in this context. Sankhya and yoga might also be translated as theory and practice. It would seem that at the time of the Gita the path of wisdom was regarded very highly, while the path of action may have been looked upon as an adulteration of the spiritual life. It is even possible that the Gita was  \fthe first Hindu scripture to introduce the novel idea of combining karma yoga with the pursuit of Self-knowledge. Krishna says that only immature, inexperienced people look upon the paths of knowledge and action as different. The true goal of action is knowledge of the Self. Following either path faithfully will lead to the complete spiritual vision. It is essential in karma yoga that the selfish ego not expect gratification from the work. When there is no selfish involvement in work, the worker does not come to spiritual harm. The example is the lotus: it spends its life floating in water, yet the drops of water roll off its leaves without ever wetting them. Similarly, as long as the karma yogis do not expect reward or recognition, any evil that might stain them has nowhere to cling. Such yogis are said to be detached from the outcome or fruits of their actions (karma phala). Krishna warns Arjuna that a life of work, even successful work, cannot be fulfilling without Self-knowledge. Ultimately, the true Self within him is not affected by what he does, whether good or bad. Only knowledge of the Self, which rises like the sun at dawn, can fulfill the purpose of his life and lead him beyond rebirth. This knowledge of the Self or Atman is, by its very nature, also knowledge of Brahman, the all-pervading, immanent and transcendent Godhead. Krishna says that the illumined person sees this divine essence in all beings. He or she has equal vision and sees the divine Self in all, regardless of the outer aspect. The last three verses of the chapter describe a state of profound meditation called samadhi. When meditation becomes very deep, breathing becomes slow, steady, and even, and the windows of the senses close to all outward sensations. Next the faculties of the mind quiet down, resting from their usually frantic activity; even the primal emotions of desire, fear, and anger subside. When all these sensory and emotional tides have ceased to flow, then the spirit is free, mukta  at least for the time being. It has entered the state called samadhi. Samadhi can come and go; generally it can be entered only in a long period of meditation and after many years of ardent endeavor. But one verse (5:28) adds the significant word sada, always. Once this state of deep concentration becomes established, the person lives in spiritual freedom, or moksha, permanently. This is extremely rare. Mystics of the West as well as the East have attained brief glimpses of unity, but very few can be said to  \fhave dwelt in it permanently, as if it were their natural habitat. In the West the most prominent figures are Meister Eckhart, St. Teresa of Avila, and St. John of the Cross, though there have been others. In the Hindu tradition there is a long line of saints and mystics who have tried to communicate something of the nature of this union with Reality or God, from the unknown recorders of the Upanishads through the Buddha, Shankara, and Meera, to Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi.   \f5: Renounce & Rejoice ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have recommended both the path of selfless action and sannyasa, the path of renunciation of action. Tell me definitely which is better. 1  KRISHNA  Both renunciation of action and the selfless performance of action lead to the supreme goal. But the path of action is better than renunciation. 2  Those who have attained perfect renunciation are free from any sense of duality; they are unaffected by likes and dislikes, Arjuna, and are free from the bondage of self-will. 4 The immature think that knowledge and action are different, but the wise see them as the same. The person who is established in one path will attain the rewards of both. 5 The goal of knowledge and the goal of service are the same; those who fail to see this are blind. 3  Perfect renunciation is difficult to attain without performing action. But the wise, following the path of selfless service, quickly reach Brahman. 6  Those who follow the path of service, who have completely purified themselves and conquered their senses and self-will, see the Self in all creatures and are untouched by any action they perform. 7  Those who know this truth, whose consciousness is unified, think always, I am not the doer. While seeing or hearing, touching or 8  \fsmelling; eating, moving about, or sleeping; breathing 9 or speaking, letting go or holding on, even opening or closing the eyes, they understand that these are only the movements of the senses among sense objects. Those who surrender to Brahman all selfish attachments are like the leaf of a lotus floating clean and dry in water. Sin cannot touch them. 11 Renouncing their selfish attachments, those who follow the path of service work with body, senses, and mind for the sake of self-purification. 10  Those whose consciousness is unified abandon all attachment to the results of action and attain supreme peace. But those whose desires are fragmented, who are selfishly attached to the results of their work, are bound in everything they do. 12  Those who renounce attachment in all their deeds live content in the city of nine gates, the body, as its master. They are not driven to act, nor do they involve others in action. 13  Neither the sense of acting, nor actions, nor the connection of cause and effect comes from the Lord of this world. These three arise from nature. 14  The Lord does not partake in the good and evil deeds of any person; judgment is clouded when wisdom is obscured by ignorance. 16 But ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self within. The light of this knowledge shines like the sun, revealing the supreme Brahman. 17 Those who cast off sin through this knowledge, absorbed in the Lord and established in him as their one goal and refuge, are not reborn as separate creatures. 15  Those who possess this wisdom have equal regard for all. They see the same Self in a spiritual aspirant and an outcaste, in an elephant, a cow, and a dog. 19 Such people have mastered life. With even mind they rest in Brahman, who is perfect and is everywhere the same. 20 They are not elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. With mind established in Brahman, they are free from delusion. 18  \fNot dependent on any external support, they realize the joy of spiritual awareness. With consciousness unified through meditation, they live in abiding joy. 21  Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses have a beginning and an end and give birth to misery, Arjuna. The wise do not look for happiness in them. 23 But those who overcome the impulses of lust and anger which arise in the body are made whole and live in joy. 24 They find their joy, their rest, and their light completely within themselves. United with the Lord, they attain nirvana in Brahman. 22  Healed of their sins and conflicts, working for the good of all beings, the holy sages attain nirvana in Brahman. 26 Free from anger and selfish desire, unified in mind, those who follow the path of yoga and realize the Self are established forever in that supreme state. 25  Closing their eyes, steadying their breathing, and focusing their attention on the center of spiritual consciousness, 28 the wise master their senses, mind, and intellect through meditation. Self-realization is their only goal. Freed from selfish desire, fear, and anger, they live in freedom always. 29 Knowing me as the friend of all creatures, the Lord of the universe, the end of all offerings and all spiritual disciplines, they attain eternal peace. 27  \fChapter Six  The Practice of Meditation This is surely one of the most intriguing chapters of the Gita, for here we are given a detailed explanation of meditation addressed to the layperson. The same meditation techniques are given in more esoteric writings, such as the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, but the Gita does it more simply, without any unnecessary mystery or complexity. This chapter also explores the question, Who is the true yogi? This word yogi, if it has any associations for the Western reader, is likely to bring up images of rather far-out types who do strange contortions with their bodies. Yogis are still thought of as standing on their heads or reclining on a bed of nails. It is true that there are many practitioners of a kind of yoga that involves physical exercises and postures; and there are those who have achieved remarkable feats like lying on beds of nails, or even being buried alive and surviving. But this physical side of yoga (called hatha yoga, the yoga of force) is not what is meant in the Gita. In fact, though physical techniques have a place, the Gita regards undue emphasis on them as extreme, not belonging to the normal course of spiritual development. In the Gita, the word yogi often has a more modest definition: it can mean a person who does his or her job with detachment from the rewards (6:1), or it can be rendered as one who has attained the goal of meditation. For yogi literally means one who is accomplished in yoga, and yoga means integration of the spirit. In this sense, yoga means wholeness or the process of becoming whole at the deepest spiritual level. The word yoga is also often used as a synonym for raja yoga, the practice of meditation as taught by Patanjali; for meditation is the direct means of becoming integrated, united with ones truest, deepest Self. Thus a yogi, among other things, is a person who is an adept at meditation. Until now, Krishna has been instructing Arjuna in the need for karma yoga, the active life of service. Now he is ready to initiate his disciple into the practice of the more interior disciplines of the spiritual life. Karma yoga, he says, is the path for those who wish to climb the mountain of Selfrealization; for those who have reached the summit, the path is shama, the peace of contemplation. At the beginning of the spiritual life, great exertion  \fis required; as the summit is approached, though the climb gets no easier, the dimension of contemplation or stillness is added. Many spiritual traditions, of course, use this image when speaking of the religious quest. The mountaintop is the place where the holy, like Moses, commune with God; and St. John of the Cross describes the path to union with God as climbing the mountain of Carmel. In climbing this mountain, willpower, self-help, intense personal effort, are absolute essentials. The literal translation of verse 5 is one should lift oneself up by ones Self  a play on the word atman, which can mean the highest Self as well as self in the ordinary sense. Ones self is thus ones friend or ones own enemy. The lower self, as Western mystics sometimes call it, is self-will  will in the negative, selfish sense. An unruly will twisted toward self-aggrandizement is an enemy lurking right inside the fort, where it can do the most damage. But those who have conquered themselves by themselves have their truest friend in the Self. Only those who have genuine self-discipline, who are self-conquered, live in peace. These, Krishna says, are true yogis. They cannot harbor any malice, cannot even bring themselves to look upon anyone as an enemy. They are samabuddhi, of equable mind. The true yogi, the person who is truly integrated inside, looks upon and feels everyone elses joy and sorrow just as if it were his own. He sees the Self in all beings, everywhere. How is this self-conquest to be made? Very simply, the Gita teaches that the mind must be made one-pointed through the practice of meditation. This is the basic technique. In the Gita we do not see the tendency for elaboration, for ritual and mystery, that we sometimes find in the Hindu tradition. Krishna simply tells Arjuna, first, that he must find an appropriate place to meditate. A suitable spot for his practice will be clean and comfortable. In a nod to tradition, one verse recommends the meditation seat be covered with kusha grass and a deer skin  the traditional seat of the yogi. The important thing, however, is not how the meditation cushion is constructed, but what is going on in the mind. Meditation is an internal discipline to make the mind one-pointed, absolutely concentrated. Second, Krishna offers a bit of advice about holding the body, head, and neck in a straight line. This may seem esoteric  a reference to the contortion-school of yoga  but actually it has a practical purpose. Sitting absolutely straight, with the spinal column erect, prevents drowsiness. Also,  \fin advanced stages of meditation, it allows for the free flow of vital energy or kundalini (see Glossary). Then practical advice is given: moderation is the path. Neither extreme asceticism nor indulgence will aid meditation. A superficial acquaintance with Hindu culture may leave the impression that it fosters either the sensuality of the Kama Sutra or the asceticism of the hermit. It is true that in Indian civilization we can easily see the ultimate development of the sensual and beautiful life in its finest manifestation, in painting, sculpture, music, and dance. And Indian cuisine is famous for its incredible variety of flavors and spices. India also presents us with the austere simplicity of the wandering holy man or sadhu. The Gita, however, recommends the middle path. Success in meditation, Krishna says, comes neither to those who eat or sleep too much nor to those who eat or sleep too little. The body should be neither overindulged nor treated harshly  the same recommendation the Buddha was to offer later, after many years of severe asceticism. This chapter contains the famous verse (6:19) comparing the mind to a steady flame. By its very nature the untrained mind is restless, constantly wandering here and there in trying to fulfil its desires. It flickers wildly like a flame in a storm  never blown completely out, yet at the mercy of the wind. Wherever it wanders, Krishna says, it must be brought back to its source; it must learn to rest in the Self. Once it is at home in the depths of contemplation, the mind becomes steady, like an upright, unflickering flame in a windless place. In this deep meditation, and only there, can the human being find true fulfillment. Then the still mind touches Brahman and enjoys bliss. Now Arjuna asks the inevitable question. Krishna is way ahead of him, and the struggling disciple calls out, Wait a minute! or words to that effect. He says, My mind is so restless and unsteady that I cannot even comprehend anything about this state of mystic peace you are talking about. The mind is so powerful, so turbulent, that trying to bring it under control is like trying to catch the wind. Krishna admits that the mind is terribly hard to train, but he maintains that it can be done through regular practice if one has detachment. It is interesting that he does not offer to help Arjuna here; that will come later. For now, he tells Arjuna that he must do it for himself, through hard work and detachment from private, personal motives.  \fThen Arjuna asks a rather surprising question: what happens to the person who believes in a spiritual goal but does not pursue it to the end? What if one of his more powerful compulsive desires gets the better of him, scattering his resolution the way a cloud is scattered by the wind? Arjuna must be at least partly convinced that there is something to all this, but either he is not ready to begin meditating or he is afraid that somehow he might fail if he tried. If he were to fail, he asks, would he have lost everything  all that he had given up in worldly life as well as his goal of self-fulfillment? Affectionately, Krishna assures Arjuna that no attempt to improve his spiritual condition could possibly be a wasted effort. Even looking ahead to the next life, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. He will be reborn in a household suitable for taking up his quest where he left off. In his next life, he will feel drawn to the spiritual goal once again, and he will have a head start. The general Hindu belief is that Self-realization requires many, many lives of spiritual discipline.   \f6: Practice of Meditation KRISHNA  It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those who work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of meditation. Theirs is true renunciation. 2 Therefore, Arjuna, you should understand that renunciation and the performance of selfless service are the same. Those who cannot renounce attachment to the results of their work are far from the path. 1  For aspirants who want to climb the mountain of spiritual awareness, the path is selfless work; for those who have ascended to yoga the path is stillness and peace. 4 When a person has freed himself from attachment to the results of work, and from desires for the enjoyment of sense objects, he ascends to the unitive state. 3  Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. 5  To those who have conquered themselves, the will is a friend. But it is the enemy of those who have not found the Self within them. 6  The supreme Reality stands revealed in the consciousness of those who have conquered themselves. They live in peace, alike in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. 7  They are completely fulfilled by spiritual wisdom and Selfrealization. Having conquered their senses, they have climbed to the summit of human consciousness. To such people a clod of dirt, a stone, and gold are the same. 9 They are equally disposed to family, 8  \fenemies, and friends, to those who support them and those who are hostile, to the good and the evil alike. Because they are impartial, they rise to great heights. Those who aspire to the state of yoga should seek the Self in inner solitude through meditation. With body and mind controlled they should constantly practice one-pointedness, free from expectations and attachment to material possessions. 10  Select a clean spot, neither too high nor too low, and seat yourself firmly on a cloth, a deerskin, and kusha grass. 12 Then, once seated, strive to still your thoughts. Make your mind one-pointed in meditation, and your heart will be purified. 13 Hold your body, head, and neck firmly in a straight line, and keep your eyes from wandering. 14 With all fears dissolved in the peace of the Self and all desires dedicated to Brahman, controlling the mind and fixing it on me, sit in meditation with me as your only goal. 15 With senses and mind constantly controlled through meditation, united with the Self within, an aspirant attains nirvana, the state of abiding joy and peace in me. 11  Arjuna, those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too much or sleep too little, will not succeed in meditation. 17 But those who are temperate in eating and sleeping, work and recreation, will come to the end of sorrow through meditation. 18 Through constant effort they learn to withdraw the mind from selfish cravings and absorb it in the Self. Thus they attain the state of union. 16  When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp in a windless place. 20 In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. 21 Having attained that abiding joy beyond the senses, revealed in the stilled mind, he never swerves from the eternal truth. 22 He desires nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow. 19  \fThe practice of meditation frees one from all affliction. This is the path of yoga. Follow it with determination and sustained enthusiasm. 24 Renouncing wholeheartedly all selfish desires and expectations, use your will to control the senses. 25 Little by little, through patience and repeated effort, the mind will become stilled in the Self. 23  Wherever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for satisfaction without, lead it within; train it to rest in the Self 27 Abiding joy comes to those who still the mind. Freeing themselves from the taint of self-will, with their consciousness unified, they become one with Brahman. 26  The infinite joy of touching Brahman is easily attained by those who are free from the burden of evil and established within themselves. 29 They see the Self in every creature and all creation in the Self. With consciousness unified through meditation, they see everything with an equal eye. 28  I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me. 31 They worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. 30  When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. 32  ARJUNA  O Krishna, the stillness of divine union which you describe is beyond my comprehension. How can the mind, which is so restless, attain lasting peace? 34 Krishna, the mind is restless, turbulent, powerful, violent; trying to control it is like trying to tame the wind. 33  KRISHNA  \fIt is true that the mind is restless and difficult to control. But it can be conquered, Arjuna, through regular practice and detachment. 36 Those who lack self-control will find it difficult to progress in meditation; but those who are self-controlled, striving earnestly through the right means, will attain the goal. 35  ARJUNA  Krishna, what happens to the man who has faith but who lacks self-control and wanders from the path, not attaining success in yoga? 38 If a man becomes deluded on the spiritual path, will he lose the support of both worlds, like a cloud scattered in the sky? 39 Krishna, you can dispel all doubts; remove this doubt which binds me. 37  KRISHNA  Arjuna, my son, such a person will not be destroyed. No one who does good work will ever come to a bad end, either here or in the world to come. 40  When such people die, they go to other realms where the righteous live. They dwell there for countless years and then are reborn into a home which is pure and prosperous. 42 Or they may be born into a family where meditation is practiced; to be born into such a family is extremely rare. 43 The wisdom they have acquired in previous lives will be reawakened, Arjuna, and they will strive even harder for Self-realization. 44 Indeed, they will be driven on by the strength of their past disciplines. Even one who inquires after the practice of meditation rises above those who simply perform rituals. 41  Through constant effort over many lifetimes, a person becomes purified of all selfish desires and attains the supreme goal of life. 45  Meditation is superior to severe asceticism and the path of knowledge. It is also superior to selfless service. May you attain the goal of meditation, Arjuna! 47 Even among those who meditate, that 46  \fman or woman who worships me with perfect faith, completely absorbed in me, is the most firmly established in yoga.  \fChapter Seven  Wisdom from Realization In Sanskrit this chapter is called The Yoga of Wisdom and Realization  or The Yoga of Wisdom from Realization. The term used for wisdom is jnana; for realization, vijnana. There is room for confusion in this terminology, as jnana and vijnana are open to differing interpretations. Both words are from the root jna, to know, which is related to the Greek word gnosis. The prefix vi added to a noun usually intensifies its meaning; so vijnana could mean to know intensely or to a greater degree. In this context, however, jnana is the standard term for the highest kind of knowledge: not scholarship or book-learning but direct knowledge of God, spiritual wisdom. If we take jnana in this sense, we are not left with an obvious meaning for vijnana, a more intense kind of jnana. Ramakrishna takes vijnana to mean an intimate, practical familiarity with God, the ability to carry through in daily affairs with the more abstract understanding that is jnana. Ramakrishna says, One who has merely heard of fire has ajnana, ignorance. One who has seen fire has jnana. But one who has actually built a fire and cooked on it has vijnana. In this chapter we find ourselves following several trails and sometimes lose the unifying theme, which is knowledge of the supreme reality underlying nature. Eventually, however, we come back to the starting point: knowledge contrasted with ignorance, transcendent reality as opposed to the phenomenal world. But to pursue the byways. First, Krishnas two natures are discussed. On the one hand, he has created out of himself the elements and all things that make up the phenomenal world. Beyond this is Krishnas spiritual nature as the transcendent Lord of the universe. Here the Gita is referring to a concept that later became a basis of the Sankhya school of Hindu philosophy. Sankhya recognized two fundamental principles underlying all things: prakriti, the principle of mind and matter, and Purusha, the principle of pure spirit. The union of these two eternal, fundamental forces sets in motion the creation of the world as we know it. Their union also shapes and defines all ordinary human experience. In Sankhya, the goal of Self-  \frealization is seen as the final freeing of the spirit (Purusha) from its flirtation with mind and matter (prakriti). Unlike Sankhya, however, in the Gita it is Krishna who is behind both prakriti and Purusha. In this chapter, Krishna is presented as the Creator of the world. His divine nature can be glimpsed in his bewildering and wonderful creation. In much Hindu mythology, it is the god Brahma who takes credit for creating the world. It is he, the four-faced deity, who has flung forth the manifold worlds of this and former (as well as future) universes. But in the mythology of Vishnu, Brahma is born in the lotus that grows from Vishnus navel. The lotus is Vishnus womb. In it Brahma is born, and at Vishnus urging he creates the worlds. Vishnu is the real Creator; Brahma is a demigod born of Vishnus will to create. Here in the Gita Krishna directly assumes all the roles and honors usually shared with the other aspects of God worshipped in the Hindu faith. It is not that these other divine personifications are rejected, but simply that all attention is on Krishna. For the author of the Gita, Krishna is the form of God to be worshipped, and for the time being all other forms of God disappear. Krishna alone is. In fact, one verse states that whatever other god one seems to worship, one is in reality approaching Krishna himself. Worshipping him, knowing him, enables the devotee to attain the goal. Though the word is not used in the Gita, the idea of the world as Krishnas lila, his play, became a cherished theme of later Hinduism. Krishna, it is said, created the world in play: just as a child might desire to have companions to play with, Krishna desired companions, and made the world. Krishna participates in the game of life; his divine qualities shine through in the world wherever there is excellence of any kind. He is, he tells Arjuna, the essence of every created thing: the sapidity of water, the brightness of fire, the effort of the spiritual aspirant. This may be what is meant by the vijnana of our title  the mystics vision of the divine as present here and now is perhaps the real meaning of the term. The word maya appears here, though not for the first time in the Gita. Just as the concepts of prakriti and Purusha are later developed in Sankhya philosophy, maya is later built into the formal structure of Vedanta, another of the six major schools of Indian philosophy. The word maya comes from the root ma, to measure out, and originally meant the power of a deity to create, especially to create what Indian philosophy calls name and form: matter and its percepts. Maya was the magical capacity to create form and  \fillusion  a gods divine power to put on a disguise, or to fling forth world after world of life. Maya is also the outward look of things, the passing show that conceals immortal being. Maya can be both delightful and dangerous, alluring and yet treacherous. The gunas, the three basic qualities of all created things, swirl within the world of maya. Crossing over the ocean of maya is the goal of the wise voyager, and one boat is devotion. In this chapter the Gita begins to stress the importance of love and devotion  themes that later become dominant. Krishnas true nature is hidden by maya (7:25). The dangers of maya are not depicted strongly in this chapter, but the delusions  moha  of life in mayas world are hinted at; they are, essentially, the self-centered attachments Krishna has been warning against. Moha, which means confusion or delusion, is something like dreaming while awake, living in a dream. The duality of attachment and aversion (love and hate) beguiles the mind into this moha-swoon right at birth (7:27). Knowing Krishna, and devotion to him, is the way beyond this delusion. Thus chapter 7 contrasts wisdom (jnana and vijnana) with the delusion (moha) of spiritual ignorance. We find here many seminal ideas that are elaborated in the later philosophies of Sankhya and Vedanta. These concepts of prakriti, Purusha, and maya do not originate with the Gita, however. The word maya appears in the Rig Veda, the most ancient of the Vedas, and Purusha is a recurring theme in the Upanishads. The Gita is a halfway point between the spontaneous insights of the Upanishads and the later, highly formalized philosophical systems. In the Gita we find an organized presentation of these and other key concepts without a cumbersome technical explanation.    \f7: Wisdom from Realization KRISHNA  With your mind intent on me, Arjuna, discipline yourself with the practice of yoga. Depend on me completely. Listen, and I will dispel all your doubts; you will come to know me fully and be united with me. 1  I will give you both jnana and vijnana. When both these are realized, there is nothing more you need to know. 2  One person in many thousands may seek perfection, yet of these only a few reach the goal and come to realize me. 4 Earth, water, fire, air, akasha, mind, intellect, and ego  these are the eight divisions of my prakriti. 5 But beyond this I have another, higher nature, Arjuna; it supports the whole universe and is the source of life in all beings. 3  In these two aspects of my nature is the womb of all creation. The birth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. 7 There is nothing that exists separate from me, Arjuna. The entire universe is suspended from me as my necklace of jewels. 6  Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings. 9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant. 8  My eternal seed, Arjuna, is to be found in every creature. I am the power of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory 10  \fof the noble. 11 In those who are strong, I am strength, free from passion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life. The states of sattva, rajas, and tamas come from me, but I am not in them. 13 These three gunas deceive the world: people fail to look beyond them to me, supreme and imperishable. 14 The three gunas make up my divine maya, difficult to overcome. But they cross over this maya who take refuge in me. 15 Others are deluded by maya; performing evil deeds, they have no devotion to me. Having lost all discrimination, they follow the way of their lower nature. 12  Good people come to worship me for different reasons. Some come to the spiritual life because of suffering, some in order to understand life; some come through a desire to achieve lifes purpose, and some come who are men and women of wisdom. 17 Unwavering in devotion, always united with me, the man or woman of wisdom surpasses all the others. To them I am the dearest beloved, and they are very dear to me. 18 All those who follow the spiritual path are blessed. But the wise who are always established in union, for whom there is no higher goal than me, may be regarded as my very Self. 16  After many births the wise seek refuge in me, seeing me everywhere and in everything. Such great souls are very rare. 20 There are others whose discrimination is misled by many desires. Following their own nature, they worship lower gods, practicing various rites. 19  When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that. 22 Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. 23 Those whose understanding is small attain only transient satisfaction: those who worship the gods go to the gods. But my devotees come to me. 21  Through lack of understanding, people believe that I, the Unmanifest, have entered into some form. They fail to realize my 24  \ftrue nature, which transcends birth and death. 25 Few see through the veil of maya. The world, deluded, does not know that I am without birth and changeless. 26 I know everything about the past, the present, and the future, Arjuna; but there is no one who knows me completely. Delusion arises from the duality of attraction and aversion, Arjuna; every creature is deluded by these from birth. 28 But those who have freed themselves from all wrongdoing are firmly established in worship of me. Their actions are pure, and they are free from the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites. 27  Those who take refuge in me, striving for liberation from old age and death, come to know Brahman, the Self, and the nature of all action. 30 Those who see me ruling the cosmos, who see me in the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva, and the adhiyajna, are conscious of me even at the time of death. 29  \fChapter Eight  Eternal Godhead This chapter alludes briefly to several important concepts presented more fully in the Upanishads, and it will be helpful to quote the Upanishads to elucidate these points. Also, this chapter presents a very ancient view of the souls journey after death. These ideas about the afterlife did not originate in the Gita, and are even more ancient than the Upanishads. Another ancient concept here is that of a cyclical universe, which is elaborated in other Hindu scriptures in great detail; this chapter merely refers to it in passing. The chapter begins with Arjuna asking what appear to be questions of theology, but the role of theologian does not fit him naturally. These questions are asked in response to the technical terms mentioned in the last verse of chapter 7. The sense of Krishnas answer is in accord with what he said earlier about his maya: he is God immanent in all things as well as God transcendent. But it is Arjunas other question that determines the direction the discourse now takes. Arjuna asks how Krishna can be known at the hour of death. Here, of course, Arjuna means Krishna in his cosmic, mystical aspect, so he is asking in essence, How can the Self-realized person enter the supreme state of immortality at the time of death? Krishna replies that whoever remembers him at the time of death will enter madbhavam, my being. If Arjuna can remember Krishna in the hour of death, he will be united with Krishna and enter into immortality. In fact, whatever it may be, the content of the mind at the hour of death directs the soul in its journey to rebirth. Thus the mind influences the evolution of the soul as it moves into the next life. Whatever a person thinks about in life  his or her deepest motivations  are likely to be the last thoughts at the time of death. So there is a continuity between this life and the next, and all the baggage of desire and motivation goes right along with the soul. But here Krishna is talking about the person  he hopes Arjuna will be such a one  who has no worldly baggage, who will remember Krishna at the final hour. To ensure he will focus his devotion on Krishna at the hour of death, Arjuna should make a practice of remembering him continually now. If he  \fmakes his mind one-pointed in meditation and learns to focus his being on Krishna, then naturally at the time of death he will think of nothing else. Otherwise, in the chaos of death, he will panic and lose his way. Krishna describes in detail what happens to consciousness at the moment of death (8:1213). These verses actually describe the yogis as being in control of the process of death. Directing their consciousness step by step through the difficult ordeal of leaving the body, they attain the supreme goal. This idea is also accepted by one of the greatest teachers of meditation in ancient India, Patanjali, who says in the Yoga Sutras that the yogi dies at will. Similar descriptions of the death process occur in the Upanishads, though there the dying person is not necessarily in control. The Upanishads give a detailed account: When the Self seems to become weak and sink into unconsciousness, the vital breaths gather to him. Then he takes with him those particles of light and descends into the heart. When the consciousness that is in the eye turns back, the dying person no longer sees any form. He is becoming one, they say; he does not see. He is becoming one, they say; he does not smell. He is becoming one, they say; he does not taste. He is becoming one, they say; he does not speak. He is becoming one, they say; he does not hear. He is becoming one, they say; he does not think or touch or know. The point of his heart lights up, and by that light the Self departs, either through the eye, or the skull, or through some other door of the body. And when he departs, life departs: and when life departs, all other vital forces depart after it. He is conscious, and with consciousness he leaves the body. Then his knowledge and his works and his previous impressions go along with him. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad iv.4.12) First consciousness is withdrawn from the senses. The dying no longer hear or see what is going on around them. They are still conscious, but the light of consciousness has been withdrawn from the senses, here called the gates of the body. There are said to be nine such gates: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, the mouth, and the organs of generation and excretion. Sometimes two more are added: the navel and the sagittal suture, located at the top of the skull and called in Sanskrit brahmarandhra, the aperture of Brahman.  \fWhen consciousness has been withdrawn from these gates, Krishna says, the mind is placed [locked up] in the heart. (8:12) Here, as in Christian mysticism, it is the heart and not the head that is taken to be the home of the soul. Probably what is meant is the heart chakra, the center of consciousness corresponding to the center of the chest. Prana (vital energy) and awareness have been withdrawn from the outer frontiers of personality and consolidated within. At this stage of the death process an ordinary person has no access to the will; but it is just here that prana, with conscious awareness, must be made to move upwards to the head. If prana leaves the body through the brahmarandhra, there will be no rebirth: that is, the dying person will enter samadhi at the time of death. In samadhi, prana is withdrawn from lower levels of awareness to rush upwards to the seventh center at the crown of the head. This is possible only for the yogi who has thoroughly mastered meditation and the control of prana. If prana exits through some other one of the eleven doors of the body, the Upanishads say, the state of immortality will not be gained: When he departs from this body, he ascends with the rays of the sun, repeating the syllable Om. As soon as he thinks of it, he comes to the sun. That, indeed, is the door to the next world. Those who know enter; those who do not know are stopped. There is a verse: A hundred and one subtle tracks lead from the heart; One of these goes upwards to the crown of the head. Going up by it, he goes to eternal life. Others depart in various directions. (Chandogya Upanishad viii.6.56) In the Gita, as well as in this passage from the Chandogya Upanishad, the mantram Om is used. If the yogis can remember the mantram even as consciousness itself is departing the body  and, the Gita adds, if they can meditate on Krishna  they will go to the highest goal. Relinquishing the body in a state of samadhi, they attain the mystic eternity that is union with Krishna. In this chapter the Gita alludes to the two paths, northern and southern, that the soul may take after death. Verses 2425 present in  \fabbreviated form what the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad spells out in obscure detail: Those who know this, who meditate upon Truth with faith while living in the forest, go to the light, from light to day, from day to the fortnight of the moons waxing, from the waxing fortnight to the six months of the suns northern journey, from those six months to the world of the devas, from the world of the devas to the sun, from the sun to the lightning. Then a spirit approaches them and leads them to the world of Brahman. In that world they live for eternal ages. They do not return again. But those who conquer worlds through sacrifice, charity, and austerity pass into the smoke, from the smoke into the night, from the night into the fortnight of the waning moon, from the fortnight of the waning moon into the six months of the suns southern journey, from there into the world of the ancestors, from the world of the ancestors into the moon, . . and from there to rebirth. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad vi.2.1516) Northern and southern paths refers to the path of the sun, which seems to move northward after the winter solstice and southward after the summer solstice. To die during the period in which the sun is moving southward was considered inauspicious; dying during the period after the winter solstice, when the sun is moving back north, meant the soul might take the northern path which leads to immortality. In the Gita and the Upanishads, this northern path has come to signify that the soul has been released from karma and need not be reborn. The southern path, by contrast, leads the soul to a new birth in this world, a birth suitable to its karma. This view of the souls journey after death has a primordial quality about it, giving the feeling that it far predates even the Upanishads. Perhaps it is a belief of very ancient times that found its way into the Upanishads, which say that the spiritually ready soul makes the journey of the northern route while those who have only practiced rituals take the southern. This chapter also briefly alludes to the Days and Nights of Brahma. Brahma is the Creator of the Hindu trinity, who brings forth the cosmos at the will of Vishnu. But Brahma in a sense is not in control of this creative  \fprocess. Just as day follows night in eternal, unvarying rhythm, so does the entire universe undergo cycles of creation, death, and new birth. As the Day of Brahma dawns, the cosmos comes into being; as the Day comes to an end, the entire creation dies and ceases to exist. Then, for a Night as long as the cosmic Day, the universe rests. It ceases to be  or, rather, it continues only in a subtle, unmanifest form, a dream in the mind of Vishnu, who lies sleeping on the waves of the cosmic ocean. Then, without deviating from the eternal rhythm, the cosmos is reborn when the Night is over. The new universe dawns, and Brahma once again moves into his active, creative Day. Scholars have noted that this grand vision of the cosmos being born, dying, and being reborn for eternity  cosmos after cosmos arising from the black immensity of nothingness  is quite similar to modern theories of the expanding and contracting universe put forward by contemporary cosmology. The vast time spans accepted by present-day physics are also similar to the cosmic Days and Nights of Brahma. Each Day lasts for a thousand yugas, which equals 4,320,000,000 years. For this near-eternity of time the universe lives and grows; then it dies and lies dormant for an equal time, before the new Day dawns. There is a state of being, however, that is higher than the perishable cosmos, which is not born and does not die the cosmic death. Here (8:20) it is called simply avyakta, the Unmanifest. This is the supreme goal of all living things, and it is Krishnas home (8:21). Returning to this final resting place, the soul enters into immortal bliss and is not reborn.   \f8: Eternal Godhead ARJUNA  O Krishna, what is Brahman, and what is the nature of action? What is the adhyatma, the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva? 2 What is the adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, and how is it to be offered? How are the self-controlled united with you at the time of death? 1  KRISHNA  My highest nature, the imperishable Brahman, gives every creature its existence and lives in every creature as the adhyatma. My action is creation and the bringing forth of creatures. 4 The adhibhuta is the perishable body; the adhidaiva is Purusha, eternal spirit. The adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, is made to me as the Lord within you. 3  Those who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do not doubt this. 6 Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death determines the destination of the dying; always they will tend toward that state of being. 7 Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. 8 When you make your mind one-pointed through regular practice of meditation, you will find the supreme glory of the Lord. 5  The Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler, subtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable, bright as the sun, beyond darkness. 10 Remembering him in this way at the time of death, through devotion and the power of meditation, with your mind completely stilled and your concentration fixed in 9  \fthe center of spiritual awareness between the eyebrows, you will realize the supreme Lord. I will tell you briefly of the eternal state all scriptures affirm, which can be entered only by those who are self-controlled and free from selfish passions. Those whose lives are dedicated to Brahman attain this supreme goal. 11  Remembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of the senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in meditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. 13 Repeating in this state the divine name, the syllable Om that represents the changeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the supreme goal. 12  I am easily attained by the person who always remembers me and is attached to nothing else. Such a person is a true yogi, Arjuna. 15 Great souls make their lives perfect and discover me; they are freed from mortality and the suffering of this separate existence. 16 Every creature in the universe is subject to rebirth, Arjuna, except the one who is united with me. 14  Those who understand the cosmic laws know that the Day of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas and the Night of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas. 18 When the day of Brahma dawns, forms are brought forth from the Unmanifest; when the night of Brahma comes, these forms merge in the Formless again. 19 This multitude of beings is created and destroyed again and again in the succeeding days and nights of Brahma. 20 But beyond this formless state there is another, unmanifested reality, which is eternal and is not dissolved when the cosmos is destroyed. 21 Those who realize lifes supreme goal know that I am unmanifested and unchanging. Having come home to me, they never return to separate existence. 17  This supreme Lord who pervades all existence, the true Self of all creatures, may be realized through undivided love. 23 There are two paths, Arjuna, which the soul may follow at the time of death. One leads to rebirth and the other to liberation. 22  \fThe six months of the northern path of the sun, the path of light, of fire, of day, of the bright fortnight, leads knowers of Brahman to the supreme goal. 25 The six months of the southern path of the sun, the path of smoke, of night, of the dark fortnight, leads other souls to the light of the moon and to rebirth. 24  These two paths, the light and the dark, are said to be eternal, leading some to liberation and others to rebirth. 27 Once you have known these two paths, Arjuna, you can never be deluded again. Attain this knowledge through perseverance in yoga. 28 There is merit in studying the scriptures, in selfless service, austerity, and giving, but the practice of meditation carries you beyond all these to the supreme abode of the highest Lord. 26  \fChapter Nine  The Royal Path This chapter praises Krishna as the Supreme Being who has created the world and dwells immanent in his creation. Krishnas exalted nature is stressed, and warning is given to those who think that God is limited to his creation. It is true that Krishna has taken on a human form, but those who see only a limited human being and show him disrespect are courting great spiritual harm. These verses contain a warning for those who would underestimate Krishnas divine power. In this chapter Krishna replaces the many gods and goddesses of the usual Hindu pantheon, each of which represents a different divine power; here Krishna is seen as containing within himself all such powers. It is Krishna and Krishna alone who is to be worshipped: he is the goal, the support, the only refuge, the one true friend; he is the beginning and the end (9:18). It follows that those who practice a ritual religion, offering the ritual sacrifices ordained by the Vedas, do not attain the true goal of their lives. True, they do enjoy heaven after death. But when their store of merit is used up, they are born again in order to have another chance at turning away from personal gain and aiming at lifes supreme goal. So long as they are motivated only by self-centered desires they must be born again and again, and their spiritual evolution either stands still or they make very little progress. Even these souls, however, are really worshipping Krishna, though they do not know it. They seek Krishna, the Supreme Being, in all their wanderings through many, many lives and even in their sojourns in heaven, where they enjoy the reward of their good deeds. Because they do not know his real nature, however, they will not attain the goal, but will be reborn. An endless round of rebirths may seem like a living damnation of the struggling soul  a harsh note that would be uncharacteristic of the Gita. But this is not a question of damnation. The purpose of life is to realize God, and until this is done, the soul cannot escape creating more karma which has to be worked out, however many lives it might take. The choice to turn toward Self-realization is always open.  \fThe Gita does not dwell on the obstacles, however, but quickly goes on to reveal Krishnas more compassionate nature. It makes the point that whatever a person deeply desires  whatever he or she worships  will eventually be attained, in some life or other. In particular, to have real, selfless love, regardless of the object, is to love Krishna, the ultimate good. This kind of love, called bhakti, is far more potent than observances and rituals  a point the Gita is slowly revealing. But to have this devotion without understanding Krishnas nature is not enough. In the end, to attain his goal, Arjuna must have devotion and understand it is Krishnas universal aspect that he loves. Then he will truly attain the eternal, immortal state. This chapter contains a famous and very popular series of verses: Whatever you do, make it an offering to me  the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. In this way you will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and painful. (9:2728) Krishna accepts every offering made to him in the right spirit; he assures Arjuna of this. Then he demands that Arjuna make everything  every act, every meal, every sacrifice, every gift, even his sufferings  an offering to God. He demands this so that Arjuna can be released from the bondage of karma. This is a new emphasis, a new way. If Arjuna can live in complete union with Krishnas will, doing everything for Krishna alone, then by that very purity of will he will be free from selfish motives and thus released from karma. His spirit will be free, and he will attain his goal of mystic union with Krishna. Krishna declares that he is impartial to all creatures: he neither favors nor rejects anyone. It is their sincere love that is important. Those who are truly devoted to Krishna live in him, and he abides in them. With some daring, probably at the risk of discomfort to the more orthodox, Krishna adds that even a sinner who takes wholehearted refuge in him becomes good. The word used is sadhu, which literally means a good person but has come to signify one who leads the spiritual life, giving up all selfish desires to achieve the final goal. The word for sinner, sudurachara, should not be passed by either. Su is literally good; dur is bad: thus one whose conduct is really bad, as we might say good and hot to mean really hot.  \fKrishna promises that his devotees must attain peace at last. No one who has genuine love and devotion can perish. The meaning here is taken to be perish in a spiritual sense, come to spiritual harm. The message of this chapter is simple. It contains no philosophy and only a little theology. The one message is: anyone who has real love, love for the Lord of Love who is in all creatures, will in the end attain the goal. This is the royal secret that Krishna had promised to reveal.   \f9: The Royal Path KRISHNA  Because of your faith, I shall tell you the most profound of secrets: obtaining both jnana and vijnana, you will be free from all evil. 1  This royal knowledge, this royal secret, is the greatest purifier. Righteous and imperishable, it is a joy to practice and can be directly experienced. 3 But those who have no faith in the supreme law of life do not find me, Arjuna. They return to the world, passing from death to death. 2  I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifested form. All creatures find their existence in me, but I am not limited by them. 5 Behold my divine mystery! These creatures do not really dwell in me, and though I bring them forth and support them, I am not confined within them. 6 They move in me as the winds move in every direction in space. 4  At the end of the eon these creatures return to unmanifested matter; at the beginning of the next cycle I send them forth again. 8 Controlling my prakriti, again and again I bring forth these myriad forms and subject them to the laws of prakriti. 9 None of these actions binds me, Arjuna. I am unattached to them, so they do not disturb my nature. 7  Under my watchful eye the laws of nature take their course. Thus is the world set in motion; thus the animate and the inanimate are created. 10  \fThe immature do not look beyond physical appearances to see my true nature as the Lord of all creation. 12 The knowledge of such deluded people is empty; their lives are fraught with disaster and evil, and their work and hopes are all in vain. 11  But truly great souls seek my divine nature. They worship me with a one-pointed mind, having realized that I am the eternal source of all. 14 Constantly striving, they make firm their resolve and worship me without wavering. Full of devotion, they sing of my divine glory. 13  Others follow the path of jnana, spiritual wisdom. They see that where there is One, that One is me; where there are many, all are me; they see my face everywhere. 15  I am the ritual and the sacrifice; I am true medicine and the mantram. I am the offering and the fire which consumes it, and the one to whom it is offered. 16  I am the father and mother of this universe, and its grandfather too; I am its entire support. I am the sum of all knowledge, the purifier, the syllable Om; I am the sacred scriptures, the Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas. 17  I am the goal of life, the Lord and support of all, the inner witness, the abode of all. I am the only refuge, the one true friend; I am the beginning, the staying, and the end of creation; I am the womb and the eternal seed. 18  I am heat; I give and withhold the rain. I am immortality and I am death; I am what is and what is not. 19  Those who follow the rituals given in the Vedas, who offer sacrifices and take soma, free themselves from evil and attain the vast heaven of the gods, where they enjoy celestial pleasures. 21 When they have enjoyed these fully, their merit is exhausted and they return to this land of death. Thus observing Vedic rituals but caught in an endless chain of desires, they come and go. 20  \fThose who worship me and meditate on me constantly, without any other thought  I will provide for all their needs. 22  Those who worship other gods with faith and devotion also worship me, Arjuna, even if they do not observe the usual forms. 24 I am the object of all worship, its enjoyer and Lord. But those who fail to realize my true nature must be reborn. 25 Those who worship the devas will go to the realm of the devas; those who worship their ancestors will be united with them after death. Those who worship phantoms will become phantoms; but my devotees will come to me. 23  Whatever I am offered in devotion with a pure heart  a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water  I accept with joy. 27 Whatever you do, make it an offering to me  the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. 28 In this way you will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and painful. Then, firm in renunciation and yoga, with your heart free, you will come to me. 26  I look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and none more dear. But those who worship me with love live in me, and I come to life in them. 29  Even sinners become holy when they take refuge in me alone. 31 Quickly their souls conform to dharma and they attain to boundless peace. Never forget this, Arjuna: no one who is devoted to me will ever come to harm. 30  All those who take refuge in me, whatever their birth, race, sex, or caste, will attain the supreme goal; this realization can be attained even by those whom society scorns. 33 Kings and sages too seek this goal with devotion. Therefore, having been born in this transient and forlorn world, give all your love to me. 34 Fill your mind with me; love me; serve me; worship me always. Seeking me in your heart, you will at last be united with me. 32  \fChapter Ten  Divine Splendor Krishna goes deeper into the revelation of his divine being, revealing himself as the source from which all things come, the One who is the reality behind the many. Though the source of all virtues, he is also the ultimate reality that transcends all opposites. Thus he is both happiness and suffering, birth and death, being and nonbeing. Like the Brahman of the Upanishads, he is beyond duality, utterly beyond the constricting categories of the things of this world. His true nature is beyond the reach of thought. He can only be known in the state of samadhi, where knower and known become one. Arjuna calls Krishna Purushottama, the supreme Purusha, the supreme Person. Krishna is now no human charioteer but Bhagavan, the munificent Lord; and Arjuna, leaving his warrior persona behind, now stands revealed as a seeker after truth. At Arjunas request, Krishna now reveals a few of his divine powers and attributes (vibhutis). From this point on the chapter becomes difficult because of the many unfamiliar names that are mentioned. In whatever category, Krishna is the chief, the best, the most intense, the most beautiful, the most awesome, the essence. Many of the allusions will be familiar  for example, among rivers Krishna is the Ganges. But many of the names come from Hindu mythology and are not well known. There is no room here to explain every name, but the following paragraphs will highlight a few of importance. First, Krishna is the Atman, the inner Self in all beings. It is fitting that this be mentioned first, for of all his myriad manifestations this is the most important, at least to the struggling spiritual aspirant that is Arjuna. Krishna is Arjunas innermost Self, and that is how he is to be known in contemplation. Of all the forms in which to meditate upon Krishna, the Atman is mentioned first. Krishna is Vishnu, the great compassionate, sustaining God of the Hindu faith. It is Vishnu who cares so much about the sufferings of Mother Earth and her children that he comes to earth again and again, in age after age, to relieve oppression and renew righteousness.  \fKrishna is the sun, worshipped in India since ancient times. He is Indra, the chief of the Vedic gods, the lord of storm and battle, who hurls the thunderbolt against the enemies of the gods. In Vedic religion he is a mighty lord, not to be trifled with, but later on he must admit defeat at the hands of Krishna, who protects the people from Indras stormy wrath. Krishna is also Shankara, the more beneficent aspect of the awesome deity Rudra, better known as Shiva. Among mountains Krishna is Meru, the high mountain home of Shiva and the other gods, the highest peak and center of the world. Krishna is consciousness, the syllable Om, and the mantram or holy name. He is the mythic horse and the fabulous elephant that were produced when the cosmic ocean was churned for the elixir of immortality. Krishna is Ananta, the cosmic serpent on which Lord Vishnu sleeps. He is Varuna, Vedic god of the oceans, and Yama, the god of death; among demons (asuras) he is Prahlada, who, though born in the race of demons, was devoted to God and never swayed in his love, even when his own father tried to kill him. And of course Krishna is Rama, the great warriorprince  also an incarnation of Vishnu  whose exploits are told in the immortal epic, the Ramayana. Of all fields of knowledge, Krishna says, he is knowledge of the Self. The study of Sanskrit and its grammar were important in ancient India, and Krishna doesnt neglect this field. He is A among letters; among compound words he is the dvandva, which joins equals. He is the Gayatri  a particular meter found in the poetry of the Vedas, but generally taken to be a famous prayer from the Rig Veda (iii.62.10) composed in that meter, which has been chanted every morning by countless worshippers for three thousand years. It is fitting that among seasons Krishna is the spring, the season of flowers. Less easily understood is his claim to be the gambling of gamblers. Krishna has a sense of play, and as gambling is the obsession of the gambler, it seems natural that Krishna might claim this as a vibhuti. Also, in ancient India gambling was considered a royal pastime, and no king of repute would refuse a friendly game of dice. In the human realm, Krishna is the son of Vasudeva, a prince of the Vrishni line  in other words, the human form that is Arjunas friend and charioteer. He is also Arjuna! And he is Vyasa, the composer of the Gita  indeed, of the whole Mahabharata.  \fWherever Arjuna finds strength, beauty, or power, Krishna concludes, he should recognize it as coming from a spark of Krishnas glory. Then, after overwhelming Arjuna with this stupendous list of divine powers and revelations, Krishna asks casually, But what use is it to know all of these details? The important fact is to know that I am, and that a tiny portion of my being supports all things.   \f10: Divine Splendor KRISHNA  Listen further, Arjuna, to my supreme teaching, which gives you such joy. Desiring your welfare, O strong-armed warrior, I will tell you more. 1  Neither gods nor sages know my origin, for I am the source from which the gods and sages come. 3 Whoever knows me as the Lord of all creation, without birth or beginning, knows the truth and frees himself from all evil. 2  Discrimination, wisdom, understanding, forgiveness, truth, selfcontrol, and peace of mind; pleasure and pain, birth and death, fear and courage, honor and dishonor; 5 nonviolence, charity, equanimity, contentment, and perseverance in spiritual disciplines  all the different qualities found in living creatures have their source in me. 4  The seven great sages and the four ancient ancestors were born from my mind and received my power. From them came all the creatures of this world. 7 Whoever understands my power and the mystery of my manifestations comes without doubt to be united with me. 6  I am the source from which all creatures evolve. The wise remember this and worship me with loving devotion. 9 Their thoughts are all absorbed in me, and all their vitality flows to me. Teaching one another, talking about me always, they are happy and fulfilled. 8  \fTo those steadfast in love and devotion I give spiritual wisdom, so that they may come to me. 11 Out of compassion I destroy the darkness of their ignorance. From within them I light the lamp of wisdom and dispel all darkness from their lives. 10  ARJUNA  You are Brahman supreme, the highest abode, the supreme purifier, the self-luminous, eternal spirit, first among the gods, unborn and infinite. 13 The great sages and seers  Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa too  have acclaimed you thus; now you have declared it to me yourself. 12  Now, O Krishna, I believe that everything you have told me is divine truth. O Lord, neither gods nor demons know your real nature. 15 Indeed, you alone know yourself, O supreme spirit. You are the source of being and the master of every creature, God of gods, the Lord of the universe. 14  Tell me all your divine attributes, leaving nothing unsaid. Tell me of the glories with which you fill the cosmos. 17 Krishna, you are a supreme master of yoga. Tell me how I should meditate to gain constant awareness of you. In what things and in what ways should I meditate on you? 18 O Krishna, you who stir up peoples hearts, tell me in detail your attributes and your powers; I can never tire of hearing your immortal words. 16  KRISHNA  All right, Arjuna, I will tell you of my divine powers. I will mention only the most glorious; for there is no end to them. 19  I am the true Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence. 20  Among the shining gods I am Vishnu; of luminaries I am the sun; among the storm gods I am Marichi, and in the night sky I am the moon. 21  \fAmong scriptures I am the Sama Veda, and among the lesser gods I am Indra. Among the senses I am the mind, and in living beings I am consciousness. 22  Among the Rudras I am Shankara. Among the spirits of the natural world I am Kubera, god of wealth, and Pavaka, the purifying fire. Among mountains I am Meru. 23  Among priests I am Brihaspati, and among military leaders I am Skanda. Among bodies of water I am the ocean. 24  Among the great seers I am Bhrigu, and among words, the syllable Om; I am the repetition of the holy name, and among mountains I am the Himalayas. 25  Among trees I am the ashvattha, the sacred fig; among the gandharvas, the heavenly musicians, I am Chitraratha. Among divine seers I am Narada, and among sages I am Kapila. 26  I was born from the nectar of immortality as the primordial horse and as Indras noble elephant. Among human beings, I am the king. 27  Among weapons I am the thunderbolt. I am Kamadhuk, the cow that fulfills all desires; I am Kandarpa, the power of sex, and Vasuki, the king of snakes. 28  I am Ananta, the cosmic serpent, and Varuna, the god of water; I am Aryaman among the noble ancestors. Among the forces which restrain I am Yama, the god of death. 29  Among animals I am the lion; among birds, the eagle Garuda. I am Prahlada, born among the demons, and of all that measures, I am time. 30  Among purifying forces I am the wind; among warriors, Rama. Of water creatures I am the crocodile, and of rivers I am the Ganges. 31  \fI am the beginning, middle, and end of creation. Of all the sciences I am the science of Self-knowledge, and I am logic in those who debate. 33 Among letters I am A; among grammatical compounds I am the dvandva. I am infinite time, and the sustainer whose face is seen everywhere. 32  I am death, which overcomes all, and the source of all beings still to be born. I am the feminine qualities: fame, beauty, perfect speech, memory, intelligence, loyalty, and forgiveness. 34  Among the hymns of the Sama Veda I am the Brihat; among poetic meters, the Gayatri. Among months I am Margashirsha, first of the year; among seasons I am spring, that brings forth flowers. 35  I am the gambling of the gambler and the radiance in all that shines. I am effort, I am victory, and I am the goodness of the virtuous. 36  Among the Vrishnis I am Krishna, and among the Pandavas I am Arjuna. Among sages I am Vyasa, and among poets, Ushanas. 37  I am the scepter which metes out punishment, and the art of statesmanship in those who lead. I am the silence of the unknown and the wisdom of the wise. 38  I am the seed that can be found in every creature, Arjuna; for without me nothing can exist, neither animate nor inanimate. 39  But there is no end to my divine attributes, Arjuna; these I have mentioned are only a few. 41 Wherever you find strength, or beauty, or spiritual power, you may be sure that these have sprung from a spark of my essence. 40  But of what use is it to you to know all this, Arjuna? Just remember that I am, and that I support the entire cosmos with only a fragment of my being. 42  \fChapter Eleven  The Cosmic Vision This is the most exalted chapter of the entire Gita, for here Arjuna sees the divine vision of Krishna in his full nature as God himself, Lord of the Universe. It is difficult to see at first why the ultimate spiritual vision should be granted to Arjuna at this point. We must remember that Krishna and Arjuna have been companions for many lives. Yet at the opening of the Gita, Arjuna is a warrior, little concerned with mystic visions. Step by step Krishna has led him to an understanding of the real purpose of his life  to know who he is and to know also who Krishna is. In the last chapter, Krishna had reached the point where he was willing to reveal to Arjuna the manifestations of divine power. Arjuna had not only asked about those powers, but had even wanted to know in which forms he might meditate on Krishna  the first time Arjuna had spoken of contemplation. Now, in chapter 11, Arjuna asks to see Krishna as He really is. His desire is granted, and in essence the rest of the chapter describes Arjunas samadhi. Samadhi is the word used by Patanjali in his classic work, the Yoga Sutras, to describe the final stage in meditation, in which the mind is completely concentrated and a superconscious mode of knowing comes into play. Patanjali speaks of many different kinds of samadhi, but for practical purposes we may speak of two: savikalpa and nirvikalpa. Arjunas vision begins with savikalpa samadhi, in which he sees God in a personal manifestation. Then, as he passes into nirvikalpa samadhi, Arjuna sees all forms disappearing into God, until only a supernatural fire consuming the entire phenomenal world is left. This supreme vision dazzles Arjuna with the blinding splendor of a thousand suns. Mystics have often described their experiences in terms of light. In an ancient prayer of the Veda, the poet asks for divine wisdom to dawn in his heart just as the sun rises in the sky. And in the West we have countless testimonies like that of St. Teresa of Avila: When the soul looks upon this Divine Sun, the brightness dazzles it. . And very often it remains completely blind, absorbed, amazed, and dazzled by all the wonders it sees.  \fAs this vision begins to unfold, Arjuna sees the whole world in the body of Krishna and he begins a hymn of praise. He sees Krishna as Vishnu with his traditional weapons, the mace and the discus, and wearing a crown. As the vision becomes more intense, Arjuna begins to feel afraid. He sees the light of God become a fire that burns to consume all things, as if at the end of time. All the warriors on the battlefield are mortals, and Arjuna sees them slain, burning in the universal fire. All creatures rush to destruction like moths into a flame. Gods radiance is both a great light and a burning fire. Terrified, Arjuna wants to know the identity of this awesome God, who bears no resemblance now to the Krishna he had known as his teacher and friend. In answer to the question, Who are you? Krishnas reply is the verse (11:32) that burst into Robert Oppenheimers mind when he saw the atomic bomb explode over Trinity in the summer of 1945: I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds. . But the word kala means not just death but time, which eventually devours all. Arjuna is brave, and worthy of this vision, for he does not lose consciousness or completely break down. He praises Krishna and then asks for forgiveness if during their long friendship he has ever said or done anything to offend the Lord through mistaking him for a mere human being. Finally, the vision is too much for Arjuna. Though he experiences the deep peace and joy of samadhi, he is terrified at the same time. He wishes to see the more human face of God. Krishna grants his desire and returns to his gentle, normal aspect. He tells Arjuna how very difficult it is to see him in his exalted form as the Lord of Yoga, the God of gods. Only pure devotion attains this vision. This theme dominates the remaining chapters of the Gita: it is devotion that is allimportant on the spiritual quest.    \f11: The Cosmic Vision ARJUNA  Out of compassion you have taught me the supreme mystery of the Self. Through your words my delusion is gone. 2 You have explained the origin and end of every creature, O lotus-eyed one, and told me of your own supreme, limitless existence. 1  Just as you have described your infinite glory, O Lord, now I long to see it. I want to see you as the supreme ruler of creation. 4 O Lord, master of yoga, if you think me strong enough to behold it, show me your immortal Self. 3  KRISHNA  Behold, Arjuna, a million divine forms, with an infinite variety of color and shape. 6 Behold the gods of the natural world, and many more wonders never revealed before. 7 Behold the entire cosmos turning within my body, and the other things you desire to see. 5  But these things cannot be seen with your physical eyes; therefore I give you spiritual vision to perceive my majestic power. 8  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, Krishna, the master of yoga, revealed to Arjuna his most exalted, lordly form. 9  He appeared with an infinite number of faces, ornamented by heavenly jewels, displaying unending miracles and the countless weapons of his power. 11 Clothed in celestial garments and covered with garlands, sweet-smelling with heavenly fragrances, he showed 10  \fhimself as the infinite Lord, the source of all wonders, whose face is everywhere. If a thousand suns were to rise in the heavens at the same time, the blaze of their light would resemble the splendor of that supreme spirit. 12  There, within the body of the God of gods, Arjuna saw all the manifold forms of the universe united as one. 14 Filled with amazement, his hair standing on end in ecstasy, he bowed before the Lord with joined palms and spoke these words. 13  ARJUNA  O Lord, I see within your body all the gods and every kind of living creature. I see Brahma, the Creator, seated on a lotus; I see the ancient sages and the celestial serpents. 15  I see infinite mouths and arms, stomachs and eyes, and you are embodied in every form. I see you everywhere, without beginning, middle, or end. You are the Lord of all creation, and the cosmos is your body. 16  You wear a crown and carry a mace and discus; your radiance is blinding and immeasurable. I see you, who are so difficult to behold, shining like a fiery sun blazing in every direction. 17  You are the supreme, changeless Reality, the one thing to be known. You are the refuge of all creation, the immortal spirit, the eternal guardian of eternal dharma. 18  You are without beginning, middle, or end; you touch everything with your infinite power. The sun and moon are your eyes, and your mouth is fire; your radiance warms the cosmos. 19  O Lord, your presence fills the heavens and the earth and reaches in every direction. I see the three worlds trembling before this vision of your wonderful and terrible form. 20  \fThe gods enter your being, some calling out and greeting you in fear. Great saints sing your glory, praying, May all be well! 21  The multitudes of gods, demigods, and demons are all overwhelmed by the sight of you. 23 O mighty Lord, at the sight of your myriad eyes and mouths, arms and legs, stomachs and fearful teeth, I and the entire universe shake in terror. 22  O Vishnu, I can see your eyes shining; with open mouth, you glitter in an array of colors, and your body touches the sky. I look at you and my heart trembles; I have lost all courage and all peace of mind. 24  When I see your mouths with their fearful teeth, mouths burning like the fires at the end of time, I forget where I am and I have no place to go. O Lord, you are the support of the universe; have mercy on me! 25  I see all the sons of Dhritarashtra; I see Bhishma, Drona, and Karna; I see our warriors and all the kings who are here to fight. 27 All are rushing into your awful jaws; I see some of them crushed by your teeth. 28 As rivers flow into the ocean, all the warriors of this world are passing into your fiery jaws; 29 all creatures rush to their destruction like moths into a flame. 26  You lap the worlds into your burning mouths and swallow them. Filled with your terrible radiance, O Vishnu, the whole of creation bursts into flames. 30  Tell me who you are, O Lord of terrible form. I bow before you; have mercy! I want to know who you are, you who existed before all creation. Your nature and workings confound me. 31  KRISHNA  I am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world. Even without your participation, all the warriors gathered here will die. 32  \fTherefore arise, Arjuna; conquer your enemies and enjoy the glory of sovereignty. I have already slain all these warriors; you will only be my instrument. 33  Bhishma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna, and many others are already slain. Kill those whom I have killed. Do not hesitate. Fight in this battle and you will conquer your enemies. 34  SANJAYA  Having heard these words, Arjuna trembled in fear. With joined palms he bowed before Krishna and addressed him stammering. 35  ARJUNA  O Krishna, it is right that the world delights and rejoices in your praise, that all the saints and sages bow down to you and all evil flees before you to the far corners of the universe. 36  How could they not worship you, O Lord? You are the eternal spirit, who existed before Brahma the Creator and who will never cease to be. Lord of the gods, you are the abode of the universe. Changeless, you are what is and what is not, and beyond the duality of existence and nonexistence. 37  You are the first among the gods, the timeless spirit, the resting place of all beings. You are the knower and the thing which is known. You are the final home; with your infinite form you pervade the cosmos. 38  You are Vayu, god of wind; Yama, god of death; Agni, god of fire; Varuna, god of water. You are the moon and the creator Prajapati, and the great-grandfather of all creatures. I bow before you and salute you again and again. 39  You are behind me and in front of me; I bow to you on every side. Your power is immeasurable. You pervade everything; you are everything. 40  \fSometimes, because we were friends, I rashly said, Oh, Krishna! Say, friend!  casual, careless remarks. Whatever I may have said lightly, whether we were playing or resting, alone or in company, sitting together or eating, 42 if it was disrespectful, forgive me for it, O Krishna. I did not know the greatness of your nature, unchanging and imperishable. 41  You are the father of the universe, of the animate and the inanimate; you are the object of all worship, the greatest guru. There is none to equal you in the three worlds. Who can match your power? 44 O gracious Lord, I prostrate myself before you and ask for your blessing. As a father forgives his son, or a friend a friend, or a lover his beloved, so should you forgive me. 43  I rejoice in seeing you as you have never been seen before, yet I am filled with fear by this vision of you as the abode of the universe. Please let me see you again as the shining God of gods. 46 Though you are the embodiment of all creation, let me see you again not with a thousand arms but with four, carrying the mace and discus and wearing a crown. 45  KRISHNA  Arjuna, through my grace you have been united with me and received this vision of my radiant, universal form, without beginning or end, which no one else has ever seen. 47  Not by knowledge of the Vedas, nor sacrifice, nor charity, nor rituals, nor even by severe asceticism has any other mortal seen what you have seen, O heroic Arjuna. 48  Do not be troubled; do not fear my terrible form. Let your heart be satisfied and your fears dispelled in looking at me as I was before. 49  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, the Lord once again assumed the gentle form of Krishna and consoled his devotee, who had been so 50  \fafraid. ARJUNA  O Krishna, now that I have seen your gentle human form my mind is again composed and returned to normal. 51  KRISHNA  It is extremely difficult to obtain the vision you have had; even the gods long always to see me in this aspect. 53 Neither knowledge of the Vedas, nor austerity, nor charity, nor sacrifice can bring the vision you have seen. 54 But through unfailing devotion, Arjuna, you can know me, see me, and attain union with me. 55 Those who make me the supreme goal of all their work and act without selfish attachment, who devote themselves to me completely and are free from ill will for any creature, enter into me. 52  \fChapter Twelve  The Way of Love This short chapter focuses upon the supreme importance of devotion and faith in spiritual development. Here love, or personal devotion, is the most powerful motivation in spiritual life. The worlds great religions agree on this point. All religions allow for a way of devotion, and millions of men and women have found spiritual fulfillment in devotion to Christ, the Buddha, or Muhammad. Hinduism has allowed a place for the path of knowledge as well as the path of devotion; here, however, the Gita stresses the efficacy of devotion. The Upanishads, the final word on mystic experience uttered by the Vedas, stressed the ultimate reality, the eternal truth behind the ephemeral things of this world. The teachers of the Upanishads told their students to seek knowledge of the Atman, their true Self. The consummation of this knowledge was to know that the Self within was one with Brahman, the ultimate reality pervading all things. This was encapsulated in the statement Tat tvam asi, You are that  that imperishable being, that immortal Reality. Brahman, the nameless, formless Godhead, could be known only in the superconscious state. The Gita moves away from such an approach to religion. For as Krishna says, seeking an eternal, indefinable, hidden Godhead is rather a tall order for the average (or even above average) person. In fact, in this chapter it is said to be beyond the reach of practically all embodied beings (dehavat, those who have bodies). This path of wisdom may be just too spiritual for earths children, because those who identify to a large degree with their physical nature find the way of knowledge too steep a climb. We can turn to one of the Western followers of this path to see why; this is Dionysius the Areopagite, a Christian monk of the fifth century, sounding remarkably like verses 34 of this very chapter: Then, beyond all distinction between knower and known, the aspirant becomes merged in the nameless, formless Reality, wholly absorbed in That which is beyond all things and in nothing else. . Having stilled  \fhis intellect and mind, he is united by his highest faculty with That which is beyond all knowing. Fortunately there is the path of love; for when God is loved in personal aspect, the way is vastly easier. According to the Hindu scriptures, God can be loved as a merciful father, a divine mother, a wise friend, a passionate beloved, or even as a mischievous child. We might turn to the Christian mystics for help here, for most of them have walked the way of love. The medieval Christian work called The Cloud of Unknowing states that love is the sure, safe path to God: By love He can be gotten and holden, by thought never. In a well-known passage in the New Testament, St. Paul puts love above knowledge and even above miraculous powers: But I shall give you a more excellent way. . Love never faileth. But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. And St. John of the Cross tells concisely why the vast majority of human beings find it easier to overcome their weaknesses through love than through knowledge: In order to overcome our desires and to renounce all those things, our love and inclination for which are wont to inflame the will that it delights therein, we require a more ardent fire and a nobler love  that of the Bridegroom. . if our spiritual nature were not on fire with other and nobler passions, we should never cast off the yoke of the senses. But such love is often not forthcoming in the struggling soul, even in one like Arjuna. So Krishna says that if Arjuna is not able to focus his devotion, he should learn to do so through the regular practice of meditation. Even love and devotion can be cultivated through regular practice; they neednt be regarded as mysterious forces, divine gifts of the spirit. If even the attempt at regular practice should fail, Krishna is still not ready to let Arjuna admit defeat. He should, Krishna says, work selflessly without desire for the fruits of his labors. But real peace of mind comes only from renunciation. The word tyaga here seems to mean renunciation or abandonment of self-will more than anything else. Such self-surrender may be a last resort, but if it is genuine it brings immediate peace.  \fVerses 1320 describe the characteristics of the genuine lover of God. Such a saintly person, Krishna points out, is greatly loved and dear to Krishna himself.   \f12: The Way of Love ARJUNA  Of those steadfast devotees who love you and those who seek you as the eternal formless Reality, who are the more established in yoga? 1  KRISHNA  Those who set their hearts on me and worship me with unfailing devotion and faith are more established in yoga. 2  As for those who seek the transcendental Reality, without name, without form, contemplating the Unmanifested, beyond the reach of thought and of feeling, 4 with their senses subdued and mind serene and striving for the good of all beings, they too will verily come unto me. 3  Yet hazardous and slow is the path to the Unrevealed, difficult for physical creatures to tread. 6 But they for whom I am the supreme goal, who do all work renouncing self for me and meditate on me with single-hearted devotion, 7 these I will swiftly rescue from the fragments cycle of birth and death, for their consciousness has entered into me. 5  Still your mind in me, still your intellect in me, and without doubt you will be united with me forever. 9 If you cannot still your mind in me, learn to do so through the regular practice of meditation. 10 If you lack the will for such self-discipline, engage yourself in my work, for selfless service can lead you at last to complete fulfillment. 11 If you are unable to do even this, surrender yourself to 8  \fme, disciplining yourself and renouncing the results of all your actions. Better indeed is knowledge than mechanical practice. Better than knowledge is meditation. But better still is surrender of attachment to results, because there follows immediate peace. 12  That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure and pain, 14 patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me  with such as these I am in love. 13  Not agitating the world or by it agitated, they stand above the sway of elation, competition, and fear: that one is my beloved. 15  They are detached, pure, efficient, impartial, never anxious, selfless in all their undertakings; they are my devotees, very dear to me. 16  That one is dear to me who runs not after the pleasant or away from the painful, grieves not, lusts not, but lets things come and go as they happen. 17  That devotee who looks upon friend and foe with equal regard, who is not buoyed up by praise nor cast down by blame, alike in heat and cold, pleasure and pain, free from selfish attachments, 19 the same in honor and dishonor, quiet, ever full, in harmony everywhere, firm in faith  such a one is dear to me. 18  Those who meditate upon this immortal dharma as I have declared it, full of faith and seeking me as lifes supreme goal, are truly my devotees, and my love for them is very great. 20  \fChapter Thirteen  The Field & the Knower This chapter presents us with two sweeping categories: the field and the knower of the field. To simplify, we may think of the field as the body and the knower of the field as the Self that resides in the body. This chapter, then, is about the duality between soul and body. This duality is seen as eternal, a basic division of all things  a fundamental concept elaborated in Sankhya philosophy. We said that the field is the body, but this is not precise enough. The field also includes the mind: in fact, it comprises all the components of prakriti including ahamkara  the awareness each of us has that we are an individual ego, from aham I and kara maker. Ahamkara is the basic awareness of separateness: that which makes me I, a being separate from the rest of creation. In this wide sense the field encompasses everything, except for the elusive consciousness that knows the field. The field is the object; the knower is the subject. Krishna is the hidden knower of the field: that is, the Self. This term field is a surprisingly modern one, for it describes what today we might call an extension of the continuum of mass, energy, time, and space to include the strata of mind as well  in other words, a field of forces both physical and mental. Just as physics no longer regards matter and energy as essentially separate, the Gita would not regard matter and mind as separate; they are different aspects of prakriti, the underlying stuff of existence. Another dimension of Krishnas use of the word field is brought out by a traditional Hindu anecdote. A wandering sadhu or holy man is asked what his work in life is; he replies, Im a farmer. When the questioner looks surprised he adds, This body of mine is my field. I sow good thoughts and actions, and in my body I reap the results. The Buddha explains, All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts; it is made of our thoughts. What we think, we become, for as Emerson says, the ancestor of every action is a thought. Thus our thoughts, taken together, bear fruit in the actions, decisions, and desires that shape our lives. In part, the body bears the fruit of what we think insofar as our way of  \fthinking affects our health and safety. But in a larger sense, the whole field of human activity (indeed the whole of prakriti) is also a field of karma  where, for example, the global environment is shaped by the sum of what its inhabitants do, which in turn is shaped by how they think. This idea will be picked up and elaborated on in detail in the concluding chapters of the Gita. Verses 711 then describe the person who understands his or her own true nature. This is an attractive picture of the modest, truly wise person who is in control of his or her own life. One implication of these verses is that it is quite an achievement to understand the difference between the field and the Self, the knower. Most people confuse the two, taking the body and mind to be who they are. In the usual course of events, we may be totally unaware that there is a Self, a consciousness underneath the surface awareness of a separate I. Verses 1217 describe the ultimate underlying reality: Brahman, pure, undifferentiated consciousness, the divine ground of existence. Verse 19 returns us to the discussion of the basic duality of mind/matter and spirit (Self). Again the technical terms prakriti and Purusha are used. Purusha is the knower and prakriti the field. From the union of these two all things are born. Both prakriti and Purusha are essential to the creation of the world: nothing could exist without the spiritual basis of Purusha, and nothing could develop in a manifest form without the mind and matter of prakriti. With its need to think of abstract principles in human terms, Hinduism embodies these two eternal principles in the figures of Shiva and Shakti, the divine Father and Mother. The Gita does not mention these two because it comes essentially from the Vishnu tradition, but in the other great stream of the Hindu faith, Shiva is the eternal Spirit, the Absolute, represented as dwelling aloof on the mountain peak of spiritual peace. Shakti, the Divine Mother, is his creative partner, and without her, Shiva could never have created the world. Shakti  she has many names in her various manifestations  rules in the realm of birth and death; Shiva, Purusha, lives in the realm of the immortal. Together the two represent Brahman, the attributeless Godhead, and the creative power of the Godhead called maya. Thus it is in the union of Shiva and Shakti that all things are born. This chapter emphasizes that the Self, the real knower, is ever uninvolved in the shifting forces that play over the field. There is no possibility of any  \fsoul being eternally lost, for all beings partake of the immortal, pure nature of Purusha. We may endure countless eons of birth and death, but we must finally find our rest in the eternal spirit. By definition, nothing taking place in the realm of prakriti can affect Purusha; but the exact nature of the interaction of these two is a profound mystery. Verse 32 explains this mystery by drawing a comparison with akasha, the subtlest element recognized by the ancient philosophers. Akasha is space itself. Just as space pervades the cosmos, yet remains pure even in the midst of impure things, so the Self remains completely pure, even though it dwells in all things. Though it seems to live in the land of mortals and to undergo change and death, the real knower in every creature is deathless, hidden in the heart.   \f13: The Field & the Knower KRISHNA  The body is called a field, Arjuna; the one who knows it is called the Knower of the field. This is the knowledge of those who know. 2 I am the Knower of the field in everyone, Arjuna. Knowledge of the field and its Knower is true knowledge. 1  Listen and I will explain the nature of the field and how change takes place within it. I will also describe the Knower of the field and his power. 4 These truths have been sung by great sages in a variety of ways, and expounded in precise arguments concerning Brahman. 3  The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy from which all these evolved. 6 In this field arise desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the body, intelligence, and will. 5  Those who know truly are free from pride and deceit. They are gentle, forgiving, upright, and pure, devoted to their spiritual teacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled. 8 Detached from sense objects and self-will, they have learned the painful lesson of separate birth and suffering, old age, disease, and death. 7  Free from selfish attachment, they do not get compulsively entangled even in home and family. They are even-minded through good fortune and bad. 10 Their devotion to me is undivided. Enjoying solitude and not following the crowd, they seek only me. 9  \fThis is true knowledge, to seek the Self as the true end of wisdom always. To seek anything else is ignorance. 11  I will tell you of the wisdom that leads to immortality: the beginningless Brahman, which can be called neither being nor nonbeing. 12  It dwells in all, in every hand and foot and head, in every mouth and eye and ear in the universe. 14 Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. 13  It is both near and far, both within and without every creature; it moves and is unmoving. 16 In its subtlety it is beyond comprehension. It is indivisible, yet appears divided in separate creatures. Know it to be the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. 15  Dwelling in every heart, it is beyond darkness. It is called the light of light, the object and goal of knowledge, and knowledge itself. 17  I have revealed to you the nature of the field and the meaning and object of true knowledge. Those who are devoted to me, knowing these things, are united with me. 18  Know that prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning, and that from prakriti come the gunas and all that changes. 20 Prakriti is the agent, cause, and effect of every action, but it is Purusha that seems to experience pleasure and pain. 19  Purusha, resting in prakriti, witnesses the play of the gunas born of prakriti. But attachment to the gunas leads a person to be born for good or evil. 21  Within the body the supreme Purusha is called the witness, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the supreme Lord, the highest Self. 22  \fWhoever realizes the true nature of Purusha, prakriti, and the gunas, whatever path he or she may follow, is not born separate again. 23  Some realize the Self within them through the practice of meditation, some by the path of wisdom, and others by selfless service. 25 Others may not know these paths; but hearing and following the instructions of an illumined teacher, they too go beyond death. 24  Whatever exists, Arjuna, animate or inanimate, is born through the union of the field and its Knower. 26  They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. 28 Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. 27  They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved. 30 When they see the variety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they attain fulfillment in Brahman. 29  This supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is touched by action. 32 As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every creature. 31  As the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the source of all light in the field. 34 Those who, with the eye of wisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to freedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal. 33  \fChapter Fourteen  The Forces of Evolution The last chapter gave us the distinction between Purusha and prakriti. This chapter will tell us in more detail about the nature of prakriti  the basis of the world of mind and matter. Here the Gita explains human experience in terms of the three qualities of prakriti, known as gunas: sattva, rajas, and tamas. When the soul attains illumination it goes beyond the confines of prakriti into the spiritual realm of Purusha. But until then, the soul must learn to deal with these three all-powerful forces. No single English word can be given to translate the words sattva, rajas, and tamas. The quality of sattva combines goodness, purity, light, harmony, balance. In terms of evolution, sattva is on the highest level. Rajas is energy  or, on the human level, passion  which can be both good and bad. In personality rajas may express itself in anger, hatred, or greed; but it also provides motivation, the will to act. Rajas is ambitious, which is not altogether a bad thing for the evolution of the soul. It is definitely superior to the third guna, tamas, which combines inertia, sloth, darkness, ignorance, insensitivity. This is the lowest state in terms of evolution; for tamas means a dead stability, where nothing much happens for good or ill. Worse, tamas can mean not just stability but a sliding backwards in the struggle of evolution, where to stand still may mean to be left behind (14:18). In any given personality or phenomenon all the three gunas are likely to be present. It is the mix of the three that colors our experience. Sattva may be dominant, with an admixture of rajas or tamas. Or perhaps rajas dominates, with a little sattva and a good measure of tamas. Finally, the personality may be basically tamasic, with a few rays of the light of sattva and a little of the heat of rajas. In any case, no mix of the three gunas is stable, for it is the very nature of prakriti to be in constant flux. The gunas are constantly shifting, always changing in intensity. It is essential that the gunas, even the purity and goodness of sattva, be transcended if the soul is to attain its final release. For the three gunas are forces that operate within the world of prakriti: in fact, their three strands make up the whole fabric of the phenomenal world. Liberation lies beyond the conditioning of prakriti, in the realm of Purusha. When Arjuna asks  \fKrishna to describe the person who has gone beyond prakritis net, Krishna replies that such a person is detached from the constant shifting and interaction of the gunas. Identified with the Self, he or she realizes that the gunas and their play are external  even the emotions and thoughts that seem so personal, so interior, are really only the play of prakriti. Thoughts and emotions, and ahamkara itself, stop at the gate of the inner Self. The Self abides in the inner chamber of the heart, always at peace, whatever forces of prakriti may storm outside. The illumined man or woman maintains a joyful evenness of mind in happiness and sorrow. At the end of the chapter, again reminding him of the power of devotion (bhakti), Krishna says that Arjuna can transcend the gunas through steadfast love. If he has devotion and has gone beyond the three gunas, then he will be fit to know Brahman.   \f14: Forces of Evolution KRISHNA  Let me tell you more about the wisdom that transcends all knowledge, through which the saints and sages attained perfection. 2 Those who rely on this wisdom will be united with me. For them there is neither rebirth nor fear of death. 1  My womb is prakriti; in that I place the seed. Thus all created things are born. 4 Everything born, Arjuna, comes from the womb of prakriti, and I am the seed-giving father. 3  It is the three gunas born of prakriti  sattva, rajas, and tamas  that bind the immortal Self to the body. 6 Sattva  pure, luminous, and free from sorrow  binds us with attachment to happiness and wisdom. 7 Rajas is passion, arising from selfish desire and attachment. These bind the Self with compulsive action. 8 Tamas, born of ignorance, deludes all creatures through heedlessness, indolence, and sleep. 5  Sattva binds us to happiness; rajas binds us to action. Tamas, distorting our understanding, binds us to delusion. 9  Sattva predominates when rajas and tamas are transformed. Rajas prevails when sattva is weak and tamas overcome. Tamas prevails when rajas and sattva are dormant. 10  When sattva predominates, the light of wisdom shines through every gate of the body. 12 When rajas predominates, a person runs about pursuing selfish and greedy ends, driven by restlessness and 11  \fdesire. 13 When tamas is dominant a person lives in darkness  slothful, confused, and easily infatuated. Those dying in the state of sattva attain the pure worlds of the wise. 15 Those dying in rajas are reborn among people driven by work. But those who die in tamas are conceived in the wombs of the ignorant. 14  The fruit of good deeds is pure and sattvic. The fruit of rajas is suffering. The fruit of tamas is ignorance and insensitivity. 16  From sattva comes understanding; from rajas, greed. But the outcome of tamas is confusion, infatuation, and ignorance. 17  Those who live in sattva go upwards; those in rajas remain where they are. But those immersed in tamas sink downwards. 18  The wise see clearly that all action is the work of the gunas. Knowing that which is above the gunas, they enter into union with me. 19  Going beyond the three gunas which form the body, they leave behind the cycle of birth and death, decrepitude and sorrow, and attain to immortality. 20  ARJUNA  What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the gunas, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the gunas hold? 21  KRISHNA  They are unmoved by the harmony of sattva, the activity of rajas, or the delusion of tamas. They feel no aversion when these forces are active, nor do they crave for them when these forces subside. 22  They remain impartial, undisturbed by the actions of the gunas. Knowing that it is the gunas which act, they abide within 23  \fthemselves and do not vacillate. Established within themselves, they are equal in pleasure and pain, praise and blame, kindness and unkindness. Clay, a rock, and gold are the same to them. 25 Alike in honor and dishonor, alike to friend and foe, they have given up every selfish pursuit. Such are those who have gone beyond the gunas. 24  By serving me with steadfast love, a man or woman goes beyond the gunas. Such a one is fit for union with Brahman. 27 For I am the support of Brahman, the eternal, the unchanging, the deathless, the everlasting dharma, the source of all joy. 26  \fChapter Fifteen  The Supreme Self This is a difficult chapter, for it deals essentially with questions of theology and ultimate mystical experience. Krishna reveals that he transcends not only the world of matter but also the immortal Atman that dwells as the conscious knower within all beings. Krishna has said that he is the Atman; but the paradox is that he also transcends the Atman. In this highest aspect Krishna is Ishvara, the cosmic Lord, who abides in his own mystery. The liberated Self enjoys union with Krishna and lives in Krishnas highest home. But the Self does not become Krishna: the immortal soul, even when liberated from its mortal journeying, does not become God. The chapter opens with the image of an upside-down tree, a world-tree rooted in Brahman which branches out into a manifold creation in this realm below. This is said to be an ashvattha or pipal tree, a kind of fig. Like the banyan, it sends out roots into the air, spreading above and below. In this chapter about Krishnas most exalted nature, it is appropriate that his home, the highest goal of all, is described. It is an abode of light and eternal life. By its very nature, it is beyond the description of human language. Verse 4 uses an elemental and ancient word for the ultimate reality that defies all description, all human thought: Tat, which means simply that or it. Here the Gita personalizes Tat to the extent of giving It a home: avyayam padam, the immortal home, the eternal goal. Pada also means foot or step, and it is of interest here to recall a myth from the Vedas. At the beginning of time Vishnu took three steps that measured out the entire cosmos. The third and highest step became a heavenly world, the realm of the blessed. In the Rig Veda (I.154.5), the poet longs to find himself in this home of the god: May I go to his blessed world Where those who love the gods rejoice; For there, truly, is the company of the far-stepping god, A fountain of honey in the highest step of Vishnu.  \fThe Gita describes Krishnas home as a realm of light beyond the light of the sun (15:6). Here we might compare the Gita with the Katha Upanishad (5:15): There shines not the sun, neither moon nor star, Nor flash of lightning, nor fire lit on earth. The Self is the light reflected by all. He shining, everything shines after him. Even here, though, we are reminded that Krishna lives not just in this highest realm but also in the world below, where both darkness and light coexist. In his divine mystery he sends fragments of himself to become the inner Self in each creature. In this sense the Self enters the body at conception, dwells in the body, and then departs at death. Krishna is the prana  the breath or vitality  of the body. The Upanishads speak of five pranas; here the Gita mentions the two most prominent: the prana by which we breathe and the prana that digests food.   \f15: The Supreme Self KRISHNA  Sages speak of the immutable ashvattha tree, with its taproot above and its branches below. On this tree grow the scriptures; seeing their source, one knows their essence. 1  Nourished by the gunas, the limbs of this tree spread above and below. Sense objects grow on the limbs as buds; the roots hanging down bind us to action in this world. 2  The true form of this tree  its essence, beginning, and end  is not perceived on this earth. Cut down this strong-rooted tree with the sharp ax of detachment; 4 then find the path which does not come back again. Seek That, the First Cause, from which the universe came long ago. 3  Not deluded by pride, free from selfish attachment and selfish desire, beyond the duality of pleasure and pain, ever aware of the Self, the wise go forward to that eternal goal. 6 Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire can add to that light. This is my supreme abode, and those who enter there do not return to separate existence. 5  An eternal part of me enters into the world, assuming the powers of action and perception and a mind made of prakriti. 8 When the divine Self enters and leaves a body, it takes these along as the wind carries a scent from place to place. 9 Using the mind, ears, eyes, nose, and the senses of taste and touch, the Self enjoys sense objects. 7  \fThe deluded do not see the Self when it leaves the body or when it dwells within it. They do not see the Self enjoying sense objects or acting through the gunas. But they who have the eye of wisdom see. 10  Those who strive resolutely on the path of yoga see the Self within. The thoughtless, who strive imperfectly, do not. 11  The brightness of the sun, which lights up the world, the brightness of the moon and of fire  these are my glory. 13 With a drop of my energy I enter the earth and support all creatures. Through the moon, the vessel of life-giving fluid, I nourish all plants. 14 I enter breathing creatures and dwell within as the lifegiving breath. I am the fire in the stomach which digests all food. 12  Entering into every heart, I give the power to remember and understand; it is I again who take that power away. All the scriptures lead to me; I am their author and their wisdom. 15  In this world there are two orders of being: the perishable, separate creature and the changeless spirit. 17 But beyond these there is another, the supreme Self, the eternal Lord, who enters into the entire cosmos and supports it from within. 16  I am that supreme Self, praised by the scriptures as beyond the changing and the changeless. 19 Those who see in me that supreme Self see truly. They have found the source of all wisdom, Arjuna, and they worship me with all their heart. 18  I have shared this profound truth with you, Arjuna. Those who understand it will attain wisdom; they will have done that which has to be done. 20  \fChapter Sixteen  Two Paths In this most unusual chapter, the Gita departs from a lofty view of human nature and describes two opposing forces. The higher tendency, the divine, leads to increasing happiness in the course of the souls evolution, and eventually to its liberation; but there is also a downward current leading to suffering and enslavement of the spirit. This chapter is unusual in giving equal, if not in fact more, attention to this dark side of human nature. Here we get a detailed description of the divine qualities that liberate and the demonic qualities that enslave (16:5). In a rare somber tone, Krishna describes the sinful person, the individual of a demonic kind  and it seems he knows what he is talking about. But first he assures Arjuna that he is of the divine type, so he shouldnt be alarmed. The demonic personality is basically atheistic. For such people life does not originate in God or a divine reality but is grounded in biology, in sexual desire. Taking a low view of human nature, such people cause suffering to themselves as well as others. They are arrogant and have many insatiable selfish desires, and they do not hesitate to do anything that will get them what they want. Krishna grants that they may attain their desires, enjoying wealth and power, but their destination is hell  a hell of their own making, often in this very life, as their karma bears fruit. One of the least likable characteristics of demonic personalities is their sense of self-importance. They like to give gifts ostentatiously and offer ritual sacrifices; this legitimizes their wealth and makes them feel respectable and esteemed. They like being generous if it will make them look good. Krishna does not disguise his aversion to cruel people. He tells Arjuna that he arranges for them to be born again and again in a harsh world. Such souls cannot seem to purify their sinful hearts; repeating the same selfish ways, they sink lower and lower. This is a bleak picture, which the Gita dwells on only in this chapter. But even here, amidst the gloom, Krishna will not say that such a soul is eternally damned. It may be that such a sinful creature is condemned to birth after birth in harsh, unfavorable  \fcircumstances, sinking into more and more hellish states of mind; but the cycle goes on, the choice to change direction is always open, and the Atman itself can never be stained. Lust, anger, and greed are the three doors to hell that Arjuna must at all costs not enter. The person who enters will not only fail to reach lifes final goal, but will not achieve any measure of lasting happiness and prosperity. In Sanskrit this chapter is called the Way of Divine and Demonic Destinies. The words deva, god, and asura, demon, are not to be taken too literally here. The Hindu scriptures often tell stories of the battles between the gods and the demons; thus they dramatize the struggle between good and evil in the world. No divine character from Hindu myth escapes a challenge from some demon. Usually the god or goddess is victorious; but often the demon will win a battle or two, though not the final victory. Krishna has a long battle record, celebrated by epithets like Madhusudana, slayer of the demon Madhu. Rama, another incarnation of Vishnu, had to confront and kill Ravana. The stories go on. The gods never seem to rest for long: there is always a new challenge to their authority, a new source of malignant evil to be destroyed. The Mahabharata and the Gita do not dwell on these mythical battles. Here the interest is more frankly human, and when Krishna discusses the divine and demonic qualities, he speaks not of gods and demons but of human good and evil.   \f16: Two Paths KRISHNA  Be fearless and pure; never waver in your determination or your dedication to the spiritual life. Give freely. Be self-controlled, sincere, truthful, loving, and full of the desire to serve. Realize the truth of the scriptures; learn to be detached and to take joy in renunciation. 2 Do not get angry or harm any living creature, but be compassionate and gentle; show good will to all. 3 Cultivate vigor, patience, will, purity; avoid malice and pride. Then, Arjuna, you will achieve your divine destiny. 1  Other qualities, Arjuna, make a person more and more inhuman: hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty, ignorance. 4  The divine qualities lead to freedom; the demonic, to bondage. But do not grieve, Arjuna; you were born with divine attributes. 5  Some people have divine tendencies, others demonic. I have described the divine at length, Arjuna; now listen while I describe the demonic. 6  The demonic do things they should avoid and avoid the things they should do. They have no sense of uprightness, purity, or truth. 7  There is no God, they say, no truth, no spiritual law, no moral order. The basis of life is sex; what else can it be? 9 Holding such distorted views, possessing scant discrimination, they become enemies of the world, causing suffering and destruction. 8  \fHypocritical, proud, and arrogant, living in delusion and clinging to deluded ideas, insatiable in their desires, they pursue their unclean ends. 11 Although burdened with fears that end only with death, they still maintain with complete assurance, Gratification of lust is the highest that life can offer. 10  Bound on all sides by scheming and anxiety, driven by anger and greed, they amass by any means they can a hoard of money for the satisfaction of their cravings. 12  I got this today, they say; tomorrow I shall get that. This wealth is mine, and that will be mine too. 14 I have destroyed my enemies. I shall destroy others too! Am I not like God? I enjoy what I want. I am successful. I am powerful. I am happy. 15 I am rich and well-born. Who is equal to me? I will perform sacrifices and give gifts, and rejoice in my own generosity. This is how they go on, deluded by ignorance. 16 Bound by their greed and entangled in a web of delusion, whirled about by a fragmented mind, they fall into a dark hell. 13  Self-important, obstinate, swept away by the pride of wealth, they ostentatiously perform sacrifices without any regard for their purpose. 18 Egotistical, violent, arrogant, lustful, angry, envious of everyone, they abuse my presence within their own bodies and in the bodies of others. 17  Life after life I cast those who are malicious, hateful, cruel, and degraded into the wombs of those with similar demonic natures. 20 Birth after birth they find themselves with demonic tendencies. Degraded in this way, Arjuna, they fail to reach me and fall lower still. 19  There are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and greed. Renounce these three. 22 Those who escape from these three gates of darkness, Arjuna, seek what is best and attain lifes supreme goal. 23 Others disregard the teachings of the scriptures. Driven by selfish desire, they miss the goal of life, miss even happiness and success. 21  \fTherefore let the scriptures be your guide in what to do and what not to do. Understand their teachings; then act in accordance with them. 24  \fChapter Seventeen  The Power of Faith At the end of the last chapter, Krishna told Arjuna to look to the scriptures to guide his actions, so that he can avoid the lower road that leads backwards to a less evolved state. Now Arjuna wants to know about those who do not follow the orthodox way set down in the scriptures, but who nevertheless offer some kind of worship with faith in their hearts. In reply Krishna goes into greater detail about the three gunas  sattva, rajas, and tamas. He also stresses the importance of shraddha or faith. This is a difficult word. Faith is not an adequate translation, and the etymology of the word is obscure; it probably has an underlying meaning of what is held in the heart. We might say that our shraddha is the sum total of our values, what we really hold to be important in our lives. Every human being, Krishna says, is shraddhamaya,made up of faith  as the Bible puts it, as we think in our heart, so we are. Here, as elsewhere in the Gita, shraddha is a positive quality. It is good to have faith; yet faith can be of different kinds, different qualities. Sattvic faith is the most evolved, the most pure. Rajasic faith is dynamic, evolving, yet tainted with selfish motives. Tamasic faith goes astray in a spiritual desert. To illustrate this, Krishna tells Arjuna that sattvic people worship the devas  the gods of heaven, of light. The rajasic worship yakshas and rakshasas. The yakshas are servants of the god of wealth; rakshasas are powerful, fearsome spirits driven by the lust for power and pleasure. Finally, tamasic people worship the spirits of the dead and ghosts. In a practical digression, Krishna describes the different kinds of food liked by the sattvic, the rajasic, and the tamasic. Then he applies the three gunas to the act of worship and sacrifice or selfless service (yajna). Verses 1416 turn to the important question of tapas or sadhana, the disciplines undergone for the sake of spiritual growth. The Gita holds that no lasting progress is possible on the spiritual path without self-discipline. The root of the word tapas is tap, to be hot or to suffer pain; and in fact tapas can also mean heat or suffering. When certain spiritual practices are mastered, they create a feeling of heat in the body, which is a sign of  \fincreased spiritual potency. Tapas also refers to the power gained through spiritual austerity. Krishna dispels the mistaken belief that tapas means mortifying or torturing the body, and points out that spiritual disciplines can be sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. The sattvic kind of tapas is offered for a truly spiritual goal; rajasic tapas is performed to gain a selfish end, probably the admiration of others. Deluded by tamas, a person will undergo painful, foolish practices to try to gain power over, or even to injure, others. Changing course for a moment, Krishna discusses the mantram Om Tat Sat. Om is the most ancient of Hindu mantrams; it is the sacred syllable that is Brahman, the cosmic sound heard in the depths of meditation. Tat is That, the supreme reality beyond what language can describe or thought can think. And sat means both that which is and that which is good. The mantram Om Tat Sat affirms that only the good really exists; the opposite word, asat, implies that evil is transient and therefore is not ultimately real. The last verse concludes that no act or intention can add to spiritual growth if it is faithless. An act done without shraddha is asat, unreal; it cannot have meaning either in this world or the next.   \f17: The Power of Faith ARJUNA  O Krishna, what is the state of those who disregard the scriptures but still worship with faith? Do they act from sattva, rajas, or tamas? 1  KRISHNA  Every creature is born with faith of some kind, either sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. Listen, and I will describe each to you. 2  Our faith conforms to our nature, Arjuna. Human nature is made of faith. A person is what his shraddha is. 3  Those who are sattvic worship the forms of God; those who are rajasic worship power and wealth. Those who are tamasic worship spirits and ghosts. 5 Some invent harsh penances. Motivated by hypocrisy and egotism, 6 they torture their innocent bodies and me who dwells within. Blinded by their strength and passion, they act and think like demons. 4  The three kinds of faith express themselves in the habits of those who hold them: in the food they like, the work they do, the disciplines they practice, the gifts they give. Listen, and I will describe their different ways. 7  Sattvic people enjoy food that is mild, tasty, substantial, agreeable, and nourishing, food that promotes health, strength, cheerfulness, and longevity. 9 Rajasic people like food that is salty or bitter, hot, sour, or spicy  food that promotes pain, discomfort, and disease. 10 8  \fTamasic people like overcooked, stale, leftover, and impure food, food that has lost its taste and nutritional value. The sattvic perform sacrifices with their entire mind fixed on the purpose of the sacrifice. Without thought of reward, they follow the teachings of the scriptures. 12 The rajasic perform sacrifices for the sake of show and the good it will bring them. 13 The tamasic perform sacrifices ignoring both the letter and the spirit. They omit the proper prayers, the proper offerings, the proper food, and the proper faith. 11  To offer service to the gods, to the good, to the wise, and to your spiritual teacher; purity, honesty, continence, and nonviolence: these are the disciplines of the body. 15 To offer soothing words, to speak truly, kindly, and helpfully, and to study the scriptures: these are the disciplines of speech. 16 Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind. 14  When these three levels of self-discipline are practiced without attachment to the results, but in a spirit of great faith, the sages call this practice sattvic. 18 Disciplines practiced in order to gain respect, honor, or admiration are rajasic; they are undependable and transitory in their effects. 19 Disciplines practiced to gain power over others, or in the confused belief that to torture oneself is spiritual, are tamasic. 17  Giving simply because it is right to give, without thought of return, at a proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy person, is sattvic giving. 21 Giving with regrets or in the expectation of receiving some favor or of getting something in return is rajasic. 22 Giving at an inappropriate time, in inappropriate circumstances, and to an unworthy person, without affection or respect, is tamasic. 20  Om Tat Sat: these three words represent Brahman, from which come priests and scriptures and sacrifice. 24 Those who follow the Vedas, therefore, always repeat the word Om when offering sacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, or giving gifts. 25 Those seeking liberation and not any personal benefit add the word Tat 23  \fwhen performing these acts of worship, discipline, and charity. 26 Sat means that which is; it also indicates goodness. Therefore it is used to describe a worthy deed. To be steadfast in self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving is sat. To act in accordance with these three is sat as well. 28 But to engage in sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving without good faith is asat, without worth or goodness, either in this life or in the next. 27  \fChapter Eighteen  Freedom & Renunciation This final chapter of the Gita roams over many subjects, beginning with a discussion of the merits of renunciation versus the life of personally involved action. To begin with, Arjuna asks about two words commonly used for renunciation in Sanskrit, sannyasa and tyaga. Both words come from roots meaning to give up or abandon. Sannyasa acquired the specialized meaning of giving up ordinary life to live the austere, wandering life of a homeless pilgrim. A sannyasi is a monk: one who does not participate in family life and has withdrawn from society. In a sense, he has withdrawn from life. Krishna does not recommend this kind of renunciation. In fact, he says it is impossible for anyone to give up in this way, for as long as we have a body, we have to do a certain amount of work just to maintain it. Krishna does not advise dropping out of life, and the Gita is primarily aimed at people who live in the world yet desire genuine spiritual fulfillment. The kind of renunciation Krishna recommends is tyaga, where it is not activity but selfish desire for the rewards of action  of work, of life  that is to be renounced. Arjuna is advised to fulfill all his responsibilities, but without a selfish motive. In particular, he should not give up the three great virtuous works  sacrifice, giving, and spiritual disciplines. Having made plain to Arjuna that renunciation is essential, Krishna goes on to explain that renunciation can be of three kinds, depending upon the guna that dominates the individuals personality. As may be expected, rajasic and tamasic renunciation leave something to be desired. Many times Krishna has said that renunciation of the fruits of work is essential. Perhaps the verse in chapter 2 said it best  that we have control over our work and actions, but we have no command of the results. The word karma-phala-tyaga appears again and again, and the literal translation is renunciation of the fruits of action. In this final chapter, literally The Freedom [moksha] That Comes from Renunciation, Krishna sums up his teaching that in work, in life, one must not be driven by a selfish desire for any kind of reward, for such compulsive work can only stunt full spiritual development. In addition, Krishna points out, when we act out of selfish  \fattachment, we must fully partake of the result, the karma, of every thought, word, and deed; and although these results may be what was desired, they may also be something not desired at all, or a little of both (18:12). In this life we can never be sure that things will turn out as planned. In verse 13 the Sankhya philosophy is again mentioned. Scholars believe that at the time the Gita was composed the Sankhya school was at an early stage of development, yet even here we see the characteristic method of thorough categorizing. Using the Sankhya categories of the three gunas, the Gita goes on to give more detail about work, which is of three kinds  sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Similarly, the doer of the work is shown to be dominated by one of these all-pervasive qualities. In a very interesting passage Krishna talks of three kinds of happiness  a practical application of the abstract theories of Sankhya (18:3639). Pursuing the world of work, and how it contributes to spiritual growth, the Gita gives a short explanation of caste in this chapter. The Gita is not especially interested in caste  the social hierarchy of Hindu society  but we do find a short explanation here. The sannyasi, the renouncing monk, has left society and therefore belongs to no caste, but Krishna does not point out that course to Arjuna. Rather, he wants Arjuna to lead an active life. Krishna tells him that devotion to his own duty is best. It is better to do ones own work, even if imperfectly, than to try to take on some other work. The work proper to each of the four castes is then described. In general, the Gita takes a liberal view of caste, and it would be wrong to interpret this chapter as supporting a rigid caste system. The final part of this chapter, verses 50 and following, give a picture of the person who has attained siddhi success or perfection  in the spiritual life and who goes on to union with Brahman. In verse 61 Krishna returns to a favorite topic  the Lord dwelling in the hearts of all beings. But here he adds a startling revelation: the Lord dwells in all, yet he whirls them around through maya as if they were toys mounted on a machine. Having jarred Arjuna with this amazing image, Krishna reassures him that he can escape from the machine, the wheel of time, through devotion to God. If he wholeheartedly takes refuge in the Lord within, then through Krishnas grace he will find peace. As his all but final word, Krishna reminds Arjuna that he holds him very dear. Through devotion, Arjuna will be able to find his way, and he should not forget that Krishna feels deep love for him.  \fThe relationship between the teacher and student is given a parting word, partially of warning. Krishna does not want these profound truths told to anyone who is not ready. Anyone lacking devotion or self-control, who does not want to hear spiritual instruction or who scoffs at it, should not be accepted as a student. The sacred act of giving spiritual instruction cannot be undertaken lightly. It is the highest work, and the man or woman who does it is most dear to Krishna. Finally, Krishna asks Arjuna if he has understood. Arjuna says yes, his conflicts are over; he is ready to follow Krishnas instructions. This concludes the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna and the instruction of the Gita proper. Sanjaya, who has been narrating the poem to blind king Dhritarashtra, adds a few final verses of benediction. He has seen this dialogue through his mystic vision, granted by the grace of Vyasa. Just recalling this wonderful conversation makes his hair stand on end in ecstasy, and when he remembers Krishnas wonderful beauty, his joy is boundless.   \f18: Freedom & Renunciation ARJUNA  O Krishna, destroyer of evil, please explain to me sannyasa and tyaga and how one kind of renunciation differs from another. 1  KRISHNA  To refrain from selfish acts is one kind of renunciation, called sannyasa; to renounce the fruit of action is another, called tyaga. 2  Among the wise, some say that all action should be renounced as evil. Others say that certain kinds of action  self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline  should be continued. 4 Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain three kinds of tyaga and my conclusions concerning them. 3  Self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline should not be renounced, for they purify the thoughtful. 6 Yet even these, Arjuna, should be performed without desire for selfish rewards. This is essential. 5  To renounce ones responsibilities is not fitting. The wise call such deluded renunciation tamasic. 8 To avoid action from fear of difficulty or physical discomfort is rajasic. There is no reward in such renunciation. 9 But to fulfill your responsibilities knowing that they are obligatory, while at the same time desiring nothing for yourself  this is sattvic renunciation. 10 Those endowed with sattva clearly understand the meaning of renunciation and do not waver. They are not intimidated by unpleasant work, nor do they seek a job because it is pleasant. 7  \fAs long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward. 12 Those who are attached to personal reward will reap the consequences of their actions: some pleasant, some unpleasant, some mixed. But those who renounce every desire for personal reward go beyond the reach of karma. 11  Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain the five elements necessary for the accomplishment of every action, as taught by the wisdom of Sankhya. 14 The body, the means, the ego, the performance of the act, and the divine will: 15 these are the five factors in all actions, right or wrong, in thought, word, or deed. 13  Those who do not understand this think of themselves as separate agents. With their crude intellects they fail to see the truth. 17 The person who is free from ego, who has attained purity of heart, though he slays these people, he does not slay and is not bound by his action. 16  Knowledge, the thing to be known, and the knower: these three promote action. The means, the act itself, and the doer: these three are the totality of action. 19 Knowledge, action, and the doer can be described according to the gunas. Listen, and I will explain their distinctions to you. 18  Sattvic knowledge sees the one indestructible Being in all beings, the unity underlying the multiplicity of creation. 21 Rajasic knowledge sees all things and creatures as separate and distinct. 22 Tamasic knowledge, lacking any sense of perspective, sees one small part and mistakes it for the whole. 20  Work performed to fulfill ones obligations, without thought of personal reward or of whether the job is pleasant or unpleasant, is sattvic. 24 Work prompted by selfish desire or self-will, full of stress, is rajasic. 25 Work that is undertaken blindly, without any consideration of consequences, waste, injury to others, or ones own capacities, is tamasic. 23  \fSattvic workers are free from egotism and selfish attachments, full of enthusiasm and fortitude in success and failure alike. 27 Rajasic workers have strong personal desires and crave rewards for their actions. Covetous, impure, and destructive, they are easily swept away by fortune, good or bad. 28 Tamasic workers are undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, dishonest, and lazy. They are easily depressed and prone to procrastination. 26  Listen, Arjuna, as I describe the three types of understanding and will. 29  To know when to act and when to refrain from action, what is right action and what is wrong, what brings security and what insecurity, what brings freedom and what bondage: these are the signs of a sattvic intellect. 30  The rajasic intellect confuses right and wrong actions, and cannot distinguish what is to be done from what should not be done. 32 The tamasic intellect is shrouded in darkness, utterly reversing right and wrong wherever it turns. 31  The sattvic will, developed through meditation, keeps prana, mind, and senses in vital harmony. 34 The rajasic will, conditioned by selfish desire, pursues wealth, pleasure, and respectability. 35 The tamasic will shows itself in obstinate ignorance, sloth, fear, grief, depression, and conceit. 33  Now listen, Arjuna: there are also three kinds of happiness. By sustained effort, one comes to the end of sorrow. 37 That which seems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end  this is the joy of sattva, born of a mind at peace with itself. 38 Pleasure from the senses seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter as poison in the end. This is the kind of happiness that comes to the rajasic. 39 Those who are tamasic draw their pleasures from sleep, indolence, and intoxication. Both in the beginning and in the end, this happiness is a delusion. 36  \fNo creature, whether born on earth or among the gods in heaven, is free from the conditioning of the three gunas. 41 The different responsibilities found in the social order  distinguishing brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra  have their roots in this conditioning. 40  The responsibilities to which brahmins are born, based on their nature, are self-control, tranquility, purity of heart, patience, humility, learning, austerity, wisdom, and faith. 42  The qualities of kshatriyas, based on their nature, are courage, strength, fortitude, dexterity, generosity, leadership, and the firm resolve never to retreat from battle. 44 The occupations suitable for a vaishya are agriculture, dairying, and trade. The proper work of a shudra is service. 43  By devotion to ones own particular duty, everyone can attain perfection. Let me tell you how. 46 By performing ones own work, one worships the Creator who dwells in every creature. Such worship brings that person to fulfillment. 45  It is better to perform ones own duties imperfectly than to master the duties of another. By fulfilling the obligations he is born with, a person never comes to grief. 48 No one should abandon duties because he sees defects in them. Every action, every activity, is surrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke. 47  One who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action. 50 Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom. 49  Unerring in discrimination, sovereign of the senses and passions, free from the clamor of likes and dislikes, 52 such a one leads a simple, self-reliant life based on meditation, controlling speech, body, and mind. 51  \fFree from self-will, aggressiveness, arrogance, anger, and the lust to possess people or things, they are at peace with themselves and others and enter into the unitive state. 54 United with Brahman, ever joyful, beyond the reach of desire and sorrow, they have equal regard for every living creature and attain supreme devotion to me. 55 By loving me they come to know me truly; then they know my glory and enter into my boundless being. 56 All their acts are performed in my service, and through my grace they win eternal life. 53  Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always. 58 Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. 57  If you egotistically say, I will not fight this battle, your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. 60 Your own karma, born of your own nature, will drive you to do even that which you do not wish to do, because of your delusion. 59  The Lord dwells in the hearts of all creatures and whirls them round upon the wheel of maya. 62 Run to him for refuge with all your strength, and peace profound will be yours through his grace. 61  I give you these precious words of wisdom; reflect on them and then do as you choose. 64 These are the last words I shall speak to you, dear one, for your spiritual fulfillment. You are very dear to me. 63  Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me. 66 Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve. 65  Do not share this wisdom with anyone who lacks in devotion or self-control, lacks the desire to learn, or scoffs at me. 68 Those who teach this supreme mystery of the Gita to all who love me perform 67  \fthe greatest act of love; they will come to me without doubt. 69 No one can render me more devoted service; no one on earth can be more dear to me. Those who meditate on these holy words worship me with wisdom and devotion. 71 Even those who listen to them with faith, free from doubts, will find a happier world where good people dwell. 70  Have you listened with attention? Are you now free from your doubts and confusion? 72  ARJUNA  You have dispelled my doubts and delusions, and I understand through your grace. My faith is firm now, and I will do your will. 73  SANJAYA  This is the dialogue I heard between Krishna, the son of Vasudeva, and Arjuna, the great-hearted son of Pritha. The wonder of it makes my hair stand on end! 75 Through Vyasas grace, I have heard the supreme secret of spiritual union directly from the Lord of Yoga, Krishna himself. 74  Whenever I remember these wonderful, holy words between Krishna and Arjuna, I am filled with joy. 77 And when I remember the breathtaking form of Krishna, I am filled with wonder and my joy overflows. 76  Wherever the divine Krishna and the mighty Arjuna are, there will be prosperity, victory, happiness, and sound judgment. Of this I am sure! 78  \fNotes CHAPTER ONE  1 The phrase on the field of dharma (dharma-kshetre) gives a hint that the battle is to be an allegorical one, a fight of dharma, justice, against adharma, evil. The battle takes place not only at Kurukshetra, the field of the Kurus, but also on the elusive field of dharma, the spiritual realm where all moral struggles are waged. 4044 These verses are particularly difficult to translate, because they revolve around the complex word dharma: law, justice, or simply somethings inner nature. To try to capture the word in English we might say Gods law or eternal truth. Dharma is divinely given; it is the force that holds things together in a unity, the center that must hold if all is to go well. The opposite of dharma is adharma: evil, injustice, chaos. In these verses Arjuna gives expression to his fears of a coming chaos, an evil world where good people will be confused and violated. Sense of unity here translates dharma; the phrase loses its sense of unity would be more literally translated as is overcome by adharma. The translation speaks in a general way of the chaos that overcomes society when dharma is weak  when ancient spiritual truths are ignored. Thus varna-samkara, literally confusion of caste, is more meaningful as society [is] plunged into chaos. The subject here is not the observance of caste restrictions, but the essential cohesion of the social fabric. 42 The Sanskrit refers to the ancient pinda rites that offer homage to dead ancestors. These rites maintained the traditions of the family by respecting and worshipping those who had gone before. Again, the rather liberal rendering the spiritual evolution begun by our ancestors seems preferable to a narrower translation. CHAPTER TWO  \f17 Tat, that, is an ancient name for Brahman, the supreme reality. Brahman is neither masculine nor feminine; in fact, it has no attributes at all. It is impossible to describe Brahman in words, so it is simply pointed to: tat. 72 The state of immortality is brahma-nirvana, the nirvana that is Brahman. This is the state of release or liberation, union with the divine ground of existence. The word nirvana comes from the Sanskrit root va to blow with the prefix nir out; it means to extinguish, as a fire is said to be blown out. Thus it indicates the extinction of the old, limited personality. By adding the word brahman, complete union with the universal Godhead is indicated. Brahma-nirvana then means the mystic state of extinction of self in the union with God. Nirvana is a Buddhist term as well. Some misconceptions are unfortunately current about this rather esoteric concept. Nirvana is wrongly presented as a kind of empty nothingness, even a spiritual death. We get exactly the opposite impression if we approach the Hindus and Buddhists themselves. It is true there is much talk of extinguishing the petty ego and going beyond self-will  the mask that hides the creative, wise, loving Self underneath. This death of the old person to make way for the new is one purpose of spiritual disciplines. It can be painful, but the death of the old does not lead to annihilation but to a spiritual rebirth. CHAPTER THREE  9 Here and later yajna is translated as selfless work or selfless service. The literal meaning is sacrifice: essentially, self-sacrifice, giving up something one greatly values for the sake of a higher purpose. Some translators give a very narrow translation of yajna as a ritualistic sacrifice, but this is inaccurate. 39 Kama can be translated as selfish desire or pleasure, and often carries a connotation of sensual desire or sexual passion. It means essentially a personal desire for ease or pleasure, not desire of a more altruistic kind. CHAPTER FOUR  \f37 This is a well-known verse. The meanings of karma are complex, but the verse is widely taken to mean that true knowledge destroys the effects of past errors, which generate further karma. When consciousness is unified and illumined, one is released from the bondage of karma. CHAPTER FIVE  6 Yoga has many meanings in the Gita. Here yoga is translated as action and selfless service because a contrast is being made between Sankhya and yoga: that is, between philosophical explanation and the actual practice of the spiritual life. 9 The word for senses in Sanskrit is indriya, literally faculty or power. The indriyas are not only the five faculties of perception (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting) but also those of action, whose organs are the hands, the feet, the tongue, and the organs of excretion and reproduction. 13 The city of nine gates is the body. The gates are the two eyes, the two nostrils, the two ears, the mouth, and the organs of excretion and reproduction. In some lists these gates are expanded to eleven by adding the navel and the brahmarandhra or sagittal suture, the opening at the top of the skull. 2728 The area of spiritual consciousness between the eyebrows is one of the seven centers of awareness or chakras described in yoga literature. These seven chakras, though not physical, are said to lie along a channel for awakened spiritual energy (kundalini) that corresponds with the spine; the chakras are located at the level of the anus, sex organs, stomach, heart, throat, eyebrows, and the top of the head. Kundalini circulates among these centers, but it is usually confined to the lowest three chakras, corresponding to the main preoccupations of life on the physical level. In yogic concentration the vital energy (kundalini) rises; samadhi is said to take place when it reaches the chakras at the brow or head. CHAPTER SIX  \f11 This describes the traditional seat used for meditation. The Gita is not concerned with the outer forms of the spiritual life, but here we do get a mention of the grass and deerskin used by the ancient sages. Perhaps the point is that they used what was available in their forest retreats, and that the seat should be what Patanjali calls sukhasana: comfortable enough to forget about your body. 14 All actions dedicated to Brahman is a literal translation of the Sanskrit word brahmacharya, a life of self-control and sense restraint. CHAPTER SEVEN  16 Artharthi has given translators some difficulties. Those who desire to achieve their purpose captures the basic meaning of the word. Artha is goal or purpose; the second word of the compound, arthi, means one who has a goal. So artharthi probably refers to those who take to the spiritual life with a particular purpose in view. Artha also means wealth or worldly goods, but to translate this phrase as those who desire wealth would go against the entire tenor of the Gita. 23 The gods here are the devas, the lower, celestial deities such as Indra. 30 These obscure terms (adhibhuta, adhidaiva, and adhiyajna) are taken up in the next chapter. CHAPTER EIGHT  6 Whatever is the content of the mind at the moment of death determines the direction of the souls rebirth. The implication is that whatever has been the bedrock of consciousness during life will be remembered at the time of death and lead the soul on to fulfill that desire in the next life. 910 The eyebrow center is discussed in the note to 5:2728. CHAPTER NINE  5 Yoga here means mysterious power. This is yet another meaning attached to the word yoga, for those who practiced yoga were  \fsometimes thought of as concealing within themselves extraordinary powers developed through their disciplines. The folklore of India relates many stories about mysterious yogis who have strange, divine powers. Krishna speaks here of his yoga aishvaram, his mysterious and majestic power. Ishvara means lord and aishvaram lordly: Krishnas yoga is something he uses as Ishvara, the Lord of the world. Now he begins to show Arjuna something of the nature of the mystery. 17 Rig, Yajur, and Sama are the principal Vedas, the ancient scriptures that are Hinduisms orthodox authority. 2021 These verses repeat the idea that heaven itself is an impermanent state. After exhausting the store of their good karma, the blessed souls in heaven must be reborn on earth. Only the liberated soul, the one who has found union with Krishna or brahmanirvana, escapes the round of rebirth and death as a separate, mortal creature. CHAPTER TEN  This chapter contains many Sanskrit names, which are briefly identified in the glossary (see p. 279). 18 Amrita, immortal, comes from a not and mrita mortal. The Greek word ambrosia is cognate and has the same meanings: amrita is the ambrosia of the gods, the drink that makes them live forever, and in a general sense it means sweet or nectar-like. So the translation could also be your words, which are like ambrosia. 22 The mind (manas) is here taken to be one of the senses or indriyas of perception; for example, it is really with the mind rather than with the eye that we see. 33 The Sanskrit alphabet, too, begins with the letter a; perhaps this is why Krishna declares that among letters he is a, the first. Another possible reason is that a is the most frequent sound in Sanskrit. CHAPTER ELEVEN  \f14 Here Arjuna presses the palms of his hands together in the gesture called anjali, like the Western gesture of prayer. This is the usual form of respectful greeting in India, as well as being used in worship and prayer. 15 Brahma, the Creator (not to be confused with Brahman, the attributeless Godhead, which is beyond the Trinity of creation, preservation, and destruction) sits within a lotus that grows from the navel of Lord Vishnu. 17 Here Arjuna sees not his friend Krishna, but the Lord incarnate in Krishna: Vishnu, armed with his traditional weapons, a club (or mace) and a discus. Not mentioned in this verse are the two benign symbols he carries in his other hands, a conch and a lotus. CHAPTER TWELVE  1 Arjuna is asking which path is superior, that of knowledge (jnana yoga) or love (bhakti yoga). CHAPTER THIRTEEN  5 This is a list of all the twenty-four categories given in Sankhya philosophy to describe phenomena in the field of prakriti. CHAPTER FIFTEEN  1 The ashvattha is the sacred pipal tree, a kind of fig often grown in temple compounds in India. The idea of a world tree appears in many ancient cultures. Here the Gita uses the image of the tree as upside down, drawing on the fact that the pipal sends out aerial roots, making branches above and below. The image illustrates the phenomenal world, rooted in Brahman, complete unity, and branching out into the apparent diversity of life. 13 Rasatmaka soma is here translated as life-giving fluid, the nourishment of plants. In Hindu mythology it is the moon, sometimes called Soma, that nourishes plants, as the source of the life-giving nectar called Soma. In the Vedas, soma is an intoxicating, invigorating  \fdrink distilled from a plant grown high in the mountains and drunk by participants in a sacred ritual. Scholars have tried to discover what the soma plant might have been, but so far no conclusive identification has been made. Soma also appears as an important god in the Vedas. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  2728 Sat means that which is real or true and that which is good; it derives from the Sanskrit verb as, to be, and is directly related to our English word is. It is noteworthy that this word sat links reality and goodness, reflecting the idea that good is eternal; it is merely covered from time to time by asat, evil, which is temporary and in that sense unreal. Asat is formed from sat by the addition of the prefix a without, very much the way English forms words like amoral. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN  1 Sannyasa and tyaga both mean renunciation, sannyasa from the root as to cast aside and tyaga from tyaj to give up. The distinction between these two is clarified in the introduction to this chapter. 14 The divine will is a translation of daivam, which comes from the word deva, god. Daivam is sometimes translated as fate, but this is inappropriate in the Gita, which is not at all fatalistic. The Gita does, however, allow a place for Gods will or Providence in the affairs of humankind  though of course the dominant force is usually karma, not daivam. 34 This verse uses the phrase dharma-kama-artha, duty, pleasure, and wealth, traditionally considered the three goals of ordinary human life. The fourth and highest goal is moksha, salvation. The rajasic personality, as this verse points out, pursues the first three worldly goals; moksha is ignored. 41 The Vedas establish the fourfold division of society into the classes of brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra  roughly priests and intellectuals; warriors and rulers; businessmen, farmers, and craftsmen; and workers and servants.  \f66 Dharma is not used here in the usual sense of law or inner nature, but in a rarer meaning: a things attribute, condition, or conditioning. Usually dharma is used in this sense only in the plural, as here: thus dharma is divine law; dharmas are the innumerable beings, things, emotions and mental states that make up everyday existence as we experience it. Here, following the root meaning (dhri, to support or hold up), sarvadharman is translated as all your supports, in the sense of external props, conditioned dependencies. Another translation would be: Cast off your dependency on everything external, Arjuna, and rely on the Self alone.  \fGlossary This brief glossary is a guide to Sanskrit terms used in this volume. Words used once and explained in context are not included. As a rough guide, Sanskrit vowels may be pronounced as in Italian or Spanish. The combinations kh, gh, jh, th, dh, ph, and bh are always pronounced as the consonant plus a slight h sound: e.g., ph as in haphazard (not as in phone). Pronounce ch as in church; h as in home; g as in gold; j as in June except in the combination jn, which can be pronounced like gn in Italian compagna. The other consonants are approximately as in English. Every Sanskrit vowel has a short and a long form, the long pronounced for twice as long as the short. The diphthongs  e, ai, o, au  are also long. The Sanskrit alphabet has 48 characters, each representing a precisely defined sound. Scholars represent these characters in our Roman alphabet by adding marks to letters as necessary, creating a system of spelling that is precise but confusing to the general reader. For simplicity, these differentiating marks have been omitted in this e-book, but may be found in the printed edition. adharma Not dharma.

Huston Smith, The Worlds Religions Each of these best-selling editions includes a detailed introduction explaining the historical and cultural background and core concepts of the scripture, with a glossary and notes. Other titles in this series:  The Dhammapada This collection of the Buddhas teachings is permeated with all the power and practicality of one of the worlds most appealing spiritual guides. The Upanishads In these most ancient of Indian wisdom texts, illumined sages share flashes of insight, the results of many years of investigation into consciousness  \fitself. THE WISDOM OF INDIA Essence of the Bhagavad Gita A Contemporary Guide to Yoga, Meditation, and Indian Philosophy Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Easwaran saw the Gita as not only magnificent literature but a sure guide to human affairs  one that could throw light on the problems I faced in my own times of crisis. This book is Easwarans guide to the Gita, his distillation of its teachings and his answer to the questions: What is the Gita really about? And what is its relevance for us today? Essence of the Bhagavad Gita is a completely new publication based on talks that Easwaran gave to his close students towards the end of his life, after forty years of a teaching career in which he taught, studied, and applied the principles of the Gita with a passionate, contagious enthusiasm. As an ancient scripture, the Gita can be confusing for modern readers, so Easwaran highlights the main themes, explains the key concepts, and shares the verses he loves best, using his own translation from the original Sanskrit. Along the way, he uncovers the Gitas startling insights into the problems threatening our civilization. Like the warrior-prince Arjuna, we must learn to make wise choices. In this modern, original interpretation Easwaran shows how the Gita points a way forward for us  both as individuals and in our global society today. Other titles in this series: Essence of the Upanishads Key to Indian Spirituality (Formerly titled Dialogue with Death) The Katha Upanishad, one of Indias classic wisdom texts, embraces all the key ideas of Indian spirituality within the context of a powerful mythic  \fquest. Set in the shadowy kingdom of Death, the Katha opens with the young hero, Nachiketa, seeking answers to the age-old questions: What is the purpose of life? And what will happen to me after I die? The King of Death emerges as the perfect spiritual guide, challenging, uncompromising, and direct. But the insights of the Katha, as with all the Upanishads, are scattered, hard to understand. Easwaran explains the core concepts and presents them systematically, illustrating them through everyday examples and analogies, as a way to explore deeper and deeper levels of personality. Taken this way, the Katha provides a comprehensive answer to the question Who am I? Essence of the Dhammapada (Forthcoming) ESSENTIAL EASWARAN LIBRARY THE BHAGAVAD GITA FOR DAILY LIVING This detailed commentary on the Bhagavad Gita in three volumes offers a unique combination of wisdom, warmth, and practical spirituality. Easwaran explains each verse, relates it to our modern lives through stories and anecdotes, and suggests small spiritual exercises that we can use to bring the Gitas teachings into our own hearts. These volumes include the Devanagari (Sanskrit) script for each verse followed by Easwarans translation, a passage from the Gita selected and translated for passage meditation, a brief overview of Easwarans eightpoint program of passage meditation, a glossary, a guide to Sanskrit pronunciation, and a detailed index. Volume 1: The End of Sorrow (Chapters 16 of the Bhagavad Gita) Volume 2: Like a Thousand Suns (Chapters 712) Volume 3: To Love Is to Know Me (Chapters 1318)  \fVolume 1 concentrates on the individual: the nature of our innermost Self, how we can discover this Self in the depths of our own consciousness, and how this discovery transforms our daily living. Volume 2 explores the indivisible unity governing all creation. Easwaran describes the steps we can take to realize this unity and to heal divisions within society and ourselves. Volume 3 is global in scope, but Easwarans emphasis is on what we can do as individuals. He explains how our everyday choices, taken all together, lead our society downwards to violence, or upwards to a wiser and more peaceful world. Passage Meditation Bringing the Deep Wisdom of the Heart into Daily Life In Easwarans universal method of passage meditation, you choose a spiritual text from the worlds great traditions that embodies your highest ideals. You memorize it, and then send it deep into consciousness through slow, sustained attention. With regular practice, the passages become lifelines, taking you to the source of wisdom deep within and then guiding you through all the challenges of daily life. Eknath Easwaran taught passage meditation to thousands of people for over forty years, including a course at the University of California. Meditation is supported by seven other points in Easwarans practical spiritual program, helping you to stay calm, kind, and focused throughout the day. Thoroughly tested, consistent and clear, this book gives you all you need to start meditating. The Mantram Handbook A Practical Guide to Choosing Your Mantram and Calming Your Mind A mantram (or mantra) is a short, powerful spiritual formula or prayer word from the worlds great traditions. Examples include Rama, Rama, used by  \fGandhi; My God and My All, used by Saint Francis of Assisi; and the Buddhist mantram, Om mani padme hum. Easwaran explains how to choose a mantram, and shows through stories and examples how it can be repeated silently anytime, anywhere, to help calm the mind and access our deepest wisdom. Repeat your chosen mantram when you are worried, angry, or caught in regrets, and the mantram will guide and comfort you like a true friend. God Makes the Rivers to Flow An Anthology of Sacred Poetry and Prose This classic anthology is Easwarans comprehensive collection of the wisest, most life-affirming, lyrical writings from the sacred literature of the world. The passages are supported by Easwarans writings on spiritual living, background notes, and guidelines for using these texts for inspiration, study, and for Easwarans own method of passage meditation.  BIOGRAPHY Eknath Easwaran (19101999) brings to this volume a rare combination of credentials: knowledge of Sanskrit, an intuitive understanding of his Hindu legacy, and a mastery of English. He was chairman of the English department at a major Indian university when he came to the United States on a Fulbright fellowship in 1959. A gifted teacher who lived for many years in the West, Easwaran explains the concepts underlying the classics of Indian spirituality in fresh, authoritative, and profoundly simple ways. Easwarans translations of the Indian spiritual classics (The Bhagavad Gita, The Upanishads, and The Dhammapada) are the best-selling editions in English. More than 1.5 million of his books on Indian and world mysticism are in print.  \fNILGIRI PRESS  \fPublishers Cataloging-In-Publication Data (Prepared by The Donohue Group, Inc.) Bhagavad Gita.

It is the dead of winter and a fierce snowstorm rages outside, but a great fire fills the space within the hall with warmth and light. Now and then, a sparrow darts in for refuge from the weather. It appears as if from nowhere, flits about joyfully in the light, and then disappears again, and where it comes from and where it goes next in that stormy darkness, we do not know. Our lives are like that, suggests an old story in Bedes medieval history of England. We spend our days in the familiar world of our five senses, but what lies beyond that, if anything, we have no idea. Those sparrows are hints of something more outside  a vast world, perhaps, waiting to be explored. But most of us are happy to stay where we are. We may even be a bit afraid to venture into the unknown. What would be the point, we ask. Why should we leave the world we know? Yet there are always a few who are not content to spend their lives indoors. Simply knowing there is something unknown beyond their reach makes them acutely restless. They have to see what lies outside  if only, as George Mallory said of Everest, because its there. This is true of adventurers of every kind, but especially of those who seek to explore not mountains or jungles but consciousness itself: whose real drive, we might say, is not so much to know the unknown as to know the knower. Such men and women can be found in every age and every culture. While the rest of us stay put, they quietly slip out to see what lies beyond. Then, so far as we can tell, they disappear. We have no idea where they have gone; we cant even imagine. But every now and then, like friends who have run off to some exotic land, they send back reports: breathless messages describing fantastic adventures, rambling letters about a world beyond ordinary experience, urgent telegrams begging us to come and see.  \fLook at this view! Isnt it breathtaking? Wish you could see this. Wish you were here. The works in this set of translations  the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Dhammapada  are among the earliest and most universal of messages like these, sent to inform us that there is more to life than the everyday experience of our senses. The Upanishads are the oldest, so varied that we feel some unknown collectors must have tossed into a jumble all the photos, postcards, and letters from this world that they could find, without any regard for source or circumstance. Thrown together like this, they form a kind of ecstatic slide show  snapshots of towering peaks of consciousness taken at various times by different observers and dispatched with just the barest kind of explanation. But those who have traveled those heights will recognize the views: Oh, yes, thats Everest from the northwest  must be late spring. And here were south, in the full snows of winter. The Dhammapada, too, is a collection  traditionally, sayings of the Buddha, one of the very greatest of these explorers of consciousness. In this case the messages have been sorted, but not by a scheme that makes sense to us today. Instead of being grouped by theme or topic, they are gathered according to some dominant characteristic like a symbol or metaphor  flowers, birds, a river, the sky  that makes them easy to commit to memory. If the Upanishads are like slides, the Dhammapada seems more like a field guide. This is lore picked up by someone who knows every step of the way through these strange lands. He cant take us there, he explains, but he can show us the way: tell us what to look for, warn about missteps, advise us about detours, tell us what to avoid. Most important, he urges us that it is our destiny as human beings to make this journey ourselves. Everything else is secondary. And the third of these classics, the Bhagavad Gita, gives us a map and guidebook. It gives a systematic overview of the territory, shows various approaches to the summit with their benefits and pitfalls, offers recommendations, tells us what to pack and what to leave behind. More than either of the others, it gives the sense of a personal guide. It asks and answers the questions that you or I might ask  questions not about philosophy or mysticism, but about how to live effectively in a world of challenge and change. Of these three, it is the Gita that has been my own personal guidebook, just as it was Mahatma Gandhis.  \fThese three texts are very personal records of a landscape that is both real and universal. Their voices, passionately human, speak directly to you and me. They describe the topography of consciousness itself, which belongs as much to us today as to these largely anonymous seers thousands of years ago. If the landscape seems dark in the light of sense perception, they tell us, it has an illumination of its own, and once our eyes adjust we can see in what Western mystics call this divine dark and verify their descriptions for ourselves. And this world, they insist, is where we belong. This wider field of consciousness is our native land. We are not cabin-dwellers, born to a life cramped and confined; we are meant to explore, to seek, to push the limits of our potential as human beings. The world of the senses is just a base camp: we are meant to be as much at home in consciousness as in the world of physical reality. This is a message that thrills men and women in every age and culture. It is for such kindred spirits that these texts were originally composed, and it is for them in our own time that I undertook these translations, in the conviction that they deserve an audience today as much as ever. If these books speak to even a handful of such readers, they will have served their purpose.  \fIntroduction  The Bhagavad Gita Many years ago, when I was still a graduate student, I traveled by train from central India to Simla, then the summer seat of the British government in India. We had not been long out of Delhi when suddenly a chattering of voices disturbed my reverie. I asked the man next to me if something had happened. Kurukshetra! he replied. The next stop is Kurukshetra! I could understand the excitement. Kurukshetra, the field of the Kurus, is the setting for the climactic battle of the Mahabharata, the vastest epic in any world literature, on which virtually every Hindu child in India is raised. Its characters, removed in time by some three thousand years, are as familiar to us as our relatives. The temper of the story is utterly contemporary; I can imagine it unfolding in the nuclear age as easily as in the dawn of Indian history. The Mahabharata is literature at its greatest  in fact, it has been called a literature in itself, comparable in its breadth and depth and characterization to the whole of Greek literature or Shakespeare. But what makes it unique is that embedded in this literary masterpiece is one of the finest mystical documents the world has seen: the Bhagavad Gita. I must have heard the Gita recited thousands of times when I was growing up, but I dont suppose it had any special significance for me then. Not until I went to college and met Mahatma Gandhi did I begin to understand why nothing in the long, rich stretch of Indian culture has had a wider appeal, not only within India but outside as well. Today, after more than thirty years of devoted study, I would not hesitate to call it Indias most important gift to the world. The Gita has been translated into every major language and perhaps a hundred times into English alone; commentaries on it are said to be more numerous than on any other scripture. Like the Sermon on the Mount, it has an immediacy that sweeps away time, place, and circumstance. Addressed to everyone, of whatever background or status, the Gita distills the loftiest truths of Indias ancient wisdom into simple, memorable poetry that haunts the mind and informs the affairs of everyday life.  \fEveryone in our car got down from the train to wander for a few minutes on the now peaceful field. Thousands of years ago this was Armageddon. The air rang with the conch-horns and shouts of battle for eighteen days. Great phalanxes shaped like eagles and fish and the crescent moon surged back and forth in search of victory, until in the end almost every warrior in the land lay slain. Imagine! my companion said to me in awe. Bhishma and Drona commanded their armies here. Arjuna rode here, with Sri Krishna himself as his charioteer. Where youre standing now  who knows?  Arjuna might have sat, his bow and arrows on the ground, while Krishna gave him the words of the Bhagavad Gita. The thought was thrilling. I felt the way Schliemann must have when he finally reached that desolate bluff of western Turkey and knew he was standing on the ringing plains of windy Troy, walking the same ground as Achilles, Odysseus, Hector, and Helen. Yet at the same time, I felt I knew the setting of the Gita much more intimately than I could ever know this peaceful field. The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gitas subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious. THE GITA AND ITS SETTING  Historians surmise that like the Iliad, the Mahabharata might well be based on actual events, culminating in a war that took place somewhere around 1000 B.C.  close, that is, to the very dawn of recorded Indian history. This guess has recently been supported by excavations at the ancient city of Dvaraka, which, according to the Mahabharata, was destroyed and submerged in the sea after the departure of its divine ruler, Krishna. Only five hundred years or so before this, by generally accepted guess, Aryan tribes originally from the area between the Caspian Sea and the Hindu Kush mountains had migrated into the Indian subcontinent, bringing the prototype of the Sanskrit language and countless elements of belief and culture that have been part of the Hindu tradition ever since. The oldest part of the most ancient of Hindu scriptures, the Rig Veda, dates from this period  about 1500 B.C., if not earlier. Yet the wellspring of Indian religious faith, I believe, can be traced to a much earlier epoch. When the Aryans entered the Indian subcontinent through the mountains of the Hindu Kush, they encountered a civilization  \fon the banks of the Indus river that archeologists date back as far as 3000 B.C. Roughly contemporaneous with the pyramid-builders on the Nile, these Indus-dwellers achieved a comparable level of technology. They had metalworkers skilled in sheet-making, riveting, and casting of copper and bronze, crafts and industries with standardized methods of production, land and sea trade with cultures as far away as Mesopotamia, and well-planned cities with water supply and public sanitation systems unequaled until the Romans. Evidence suggests that they may have used a decimal system of measurement. But most remarkable, images of Shiva as Yogeshvara, the Lord of Yoga, suggest that meditation was practiced in a civilization which flourished a millennium before the Vedas were committed to an oral tradition. If this is so, it would imply that the same systematic attitude the Indus Valley dwellers applied to their technology was applied also to study of the mind. This was brahmavidya, the supreme science  supreme because where other sciences studied the external world, brahmavidya sought knowledge of an underlying reality which would inform all other studies and activities. Whatever its origins, in the early part of the first millennium B.C. we find clearly stated both the methods and the discoveries of brahmavidya. With this introspective tool the inspired rishis (literally seers) of ancient India analyzed their awareness of human experience to see if there was anything in it that was absolute. Their findings can be summarized in three statements which Aldous Huxley, following Leibnitz, has called the Perennial Philosophy because they appear in every age and civilization: (1) there is an infinite, changeless reality beneath the world of change; (2) this same reality lies at the core of every human personality; (3) the purpose of life is to discover this reality experientially: that is, to realize God while here on earth. These principles and the interior experiments for realizing them were taught systematically in forest academies or ashrams  a tradition which continues unbroken after some three thousand years. The discoveries of brahmavidya were systematically committed to memory (and eventually to writing) in the Upanishads, visionary documents that are the earliest and purest statement of the Perennial Philosophy. How many of these precious records once existed no one knows; a dozen that date from Vedic times have survived as part of the Hindu canon of authority, the four Vedas. All have one unmistakable hallmark: the vivid  \fstamp of personal mystical experience. These are records of direct encounter with the divine. Tradition calls them shruti: literally heard, as opposed to learned; they are their own authority. By convention, only the Vedas (including their Upanishads) are considered shruti, based on direct knowledge of God. According to this definition, all other Indian scriptures  including the Gita  are secondary, dependent on the higher authority of the Vedas. However, this is a conventional distinction and one that might disguise the nature of the documents it classifies. In the literal sense the Gita too is shruti, owing its authority not to other scriptures but to the fact that it set down the direct mystical experience of a single author. Shankara, a towering mystic of the ninth century A.D. whose word carries the authority of Augustine, Eckhart, and Aquinas all in one, must have felt this, for in selecting the minimum sources of Hinduism he passed over almost a hundred Upanishads of Vedic authority to choose ten central Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita. The Gita, I would argue, is not an integral part of the Mahabharata. It is essentially an Upanishad, and my conjecture is that it was set down by an inspired seer (traditionally Vyasa) and inserted into the epic at the appropriate place. Other elements were added in this way to the Mahabharata, and to other popular secondary scriptures; it is an effective way of preserving new material in an oral tradition. There is also traditional weight behind this idea, for as far back as anyone can trace, each chapter of the Gita has ended with the same formula: In the Bhagavad-Gita Upanishad, the text on the supreme science [brahmavidya] of yoga, this is the chapter entitled . . Finally, by way of further support, we can observe that except for its first chapter, which sets the stage, the Gita not only does not develop the action of the Mahabharata but is rather at odds with it. Battle lines are drawn  the climax of decades of dissension  and on the eve of combat, Prince Arjuna loses his nerve and asks his charioteer, Krishna, what to do. Then what? Krishna  no ordinary charioteer, but an incarnation of God  enters into some seven hundred verses of sublime instruction on the nature of the soul and its relation to God, the levels of consciousness and reality, the makeup of the phenomenal world, and so on, culminating in a stupendous mystical experience in which he reveals himself to Arjuna as the transcendent Lord of life and death. He counsels Arjuna to be compassionate to friend and  \fenemy alike, to see himself in every person, to suffer others sorrows as his own. Then the Gita is over, the narration picks up again, and battle is joined  a terrible, desperate slaughter compromising everyones honor, by the end of which Arjunas side emerges victorious. But almost every man of fighting age on both sides has been slain. Only great genius would have placed the Gita in such a dramatic setting, but it stands out from the rest as a timeless, practical manual for daily living. To those who take this dramatic setting as part of the spiritual instruction and get entangled in the question of the Gita justifying war, Gandhi had a practical answer: just base your life on the Gita sincerely and systematically and see if you find killing or even hurting others compatible with its teachings. (He makes the same point of the Sermon on the Mount.) The very heart of the Gitas message is to see the Lord in every creature and act accordingly, and the scripture is full of verses to spell out what this means: I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me. They worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. (6:3031) When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. (6:32) That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. (12:13) They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. (13:2728) Scholars can debate the point forever, but when the Gita is practiced, I think, it becomes clear that the struggle the Gita is concerned with is the struggle for self-mastery. It was Vyasas genius to take the whole great Mahabharata epic and see it as metaphor for the perennial war between the forces of light and the forces of darkness in every human heart. Arjuna and Krishna are then no longer merely characters in a literary masterpiece. Arjuna becomes Everyman, asking the Lord himself, Sri Krishna, the  \fperennial questions about life and death  not as a philosopher, but as the quintessential man of action. Thus read, the Gita is not an external dialogue but an internal one: between the ordinary human personality, full of questions about the meaning of life, and our deepest Self, which is divine. There is, in fact, no other way to read the Gita and grasp it as spiritual instruction. If I could offer only one key to understanding this divine dialogue, it would be to remember that it takes place in the depths of consciousness and that Krishna is not some external being, human or superhuman, but the spark of divinity that lies at the core of the human personality. This is not literary or philosophical conjecture; Krishna says as much to Arjuna over and over: I am the Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence (10:20). In such statements the Gita distills the essence of the Upanishads, not piecemeal but comprehensively, offering their lofty insights as a manual not of philosophy but of everyday human activity  a handbook of the Perennial Philosophy unique in world history. THE UPANISHADIC BACKGROUND  The Gita, naturally enough, takes for granted that its audience is familiar with the basic ideas of Hindu religious thought, almost all of which can be found in the Upanishads. It also uses some technical vocabulary from yoga psychology. All this needs to be explained in contemporary terms if the modern reader is to grasp what is essential and timeless in the Gitas message and not get bogged down in strange terminology. First, however, the non-Hindu faces a third obstacle: the multiplicity of names used for aspects of God. From the earliest times, Hinduism has proclaimed one God while accommodating worship of him (or her, for to millions God is the Divine Mother) in many different names. Truth is one, says a famous verse of the Rig Veda; people call it by various names. Monastic devotees might find that Shiva embodies the austere detachment they seek; devotees who want to live in the world, partaking of its innocent pleasures but devoted to service of their fellow creatures, might find in Krishna the perfect incarnation of their ideals. In every case, this clothing of the Infinite in human form serves to focus a devotees love and to provide an inspiring ideal. But whatever form is worshipped, it is only an aspect of the same one God.  \fIn the Gita  in fact, virtually everywhere in Hindu myth and scripture  we also encounter the gods in the plural. These are the devas, deities which seem to have come in with the Aryans and which have recognizable counterparts in other Aryan-influenced cultures: Indra, god of war and storm; Varuna, god of waters and a moral overseer; Agni, god of fire, the Hermes-like intermediary between heaven and earth; and so on. The Gita refers to the devas as being worshipped by those who want to propitiate natural and supernatural powers, in much the same way that ancestors were worshipped. In modern terms, they can best be understood as personifying the forces of nature. This question out of the way, we can proceed to the Upanishadic background the Gita assumes. Atman and Brahman  The Upanishads are not systematic philosophy; they are more like ecstatic slide shows of mystical experience  vivid, disjointed, stamped with the power of direct personal encounter with the divine. If they seem to embrace contradictions, that is because they do not try to smooth over the seams of these experiences. They simply set down what the rishis saw, viewing the ultimate reality from different levels of spiritual awareness, like snapshots of the same object from different angles: now seeing God as utterly transcendent, for example, now seeing God as immanent as well. These differences are not important, and the Upanishads agree on their central ideas: Brahman, the Godhead; Atman, the divine core of personality; dharma, the law that expresses and maintains the unity of creation; karma, the web of cause and effect; samsara, the cycle of birth and death; moksha, the spiritual liberation that is lifes supreme goal. Even while ancient India was making breakthroughs in the natural sciences and mathematics, the sages of the Upanishads were turning inward to analyze the data that nature presents to the mind. Penetrating below the senses, they found not a world of solid, separate objects but a ceaseless process of change  matter coming together, dissolving, and coming together again in a different form. Below this flux of things with name and form, however, they found something changeless: an infinite, indivisible reality in which the transient data of the world cohere. They called this reality Brahman: the Godhead, the divine ground of existence.  \fThis analysis of the phenomenal world tallies well enough with contemporary physics. A physicist would remind us that the things we see out there are not ultimately separate from each other and from us; we perceive them as separate because of the limitations of our senses. If our eyes were sensitive to a much finer spectrum, we might see the world as a continuous field of matter and energy. Nothing in this picture resembles a solid object in our usual sense of the word. The external world of physics, wrote Sir Arthur Eddington, has thus become a world of shadows. In removing our illusions we remove the substance, for indeed we have seen that substance is one of the greatest of our illusions. Like the physicists, these ancient sages were seeking an invariant. They found it in Brahman. In examining our knowledge of ourselves, the sages made a similar discovery. Instead of a single coherent personality, they found layer on layer of components  senses, emotions, will, intellect, ego  each in flux. At different times and in different company, the same person seems to have different personalities. Moods shift and flicker, even in those who are emotionally stable; desires and opinions change with time. Change is the nature of the mind. The sages observed this flow of thoughts and sensations and asked, Then where am I? The parts do not add up to a whole; they just flow by. Like physical phenomena, the mind is a field of forces, no more the seat of intelligence than radiation or gravity is. Just as the world dissolves into a sea of energy, the mind dissolves into a river of impressions and thoughts, a flow of fragmentary data that do not hold together. Western philosophers have reasoned their way to a similar conclusion, but with them it was an intellectual exercise. David Hume confesses that whenever he was forced to conclude that his empirical ego was insubstantial, he went out for a walk, had a good dinner, and forgot all about it. For these ancient sages, however, these were not logical conclusions but personal discoveries. They were actually exploring the mind, testing each level of awareness by withdrawing consciousness to the level below. In profound meditation, they found, when consciousness is so acutely focused that it is utterly withdrawn from the body and mind, it enters a kind of singularity in which the sense of a separate ego disappears. In this state, the supreme climax of meditation, the seers discovered a core of consciousness beyond time and change. They called it simply Atman, the Self. I have described the discovery of Atman and Brahman  God immanent and God transcendent  as separate, but there is no real distinction. In the  \fclimax of meditation, the sages discovered unity: the same indivisible reality without and within. It was advaita, not two. The Chandogya Upanishad says epigrammatically, Tat tvam asi: Thou art That. Atman is Brahman: the Self in each person is not different from the Godhead. Nor is it different from person to person. The Self is one, the same in every creature. This is not some peculiar tenet of the Hindu scriptures; it is the testimony of everyone who has undergone these experiments in the depths of consciousness and followed them through to the end. Here is Ruysbroeck, a great mystic of medieval Europe; every word is most carefully chosen: The image of God is found essentially and personally in all mankind. Each possesses it whole, entire and undivided, and all together not more than one alone. In this way we are all one, intimately united in our eternal image, which is the image of God and the source in us of all our life. Maya  In the unitive experience, every trace of separateness disappears; life is a seamless whole. But the body cannot remain in this state for long. After a while, awareness of mind and body returns, and then the conventional world of multiplicity rushes in again with such vigor and vividness that the memory of unity, though stamped with reality, seems as distant as a dream. The unitive state has to be entered over and over until a person is established in it. But once established, even in the midst of ordinary life, one sees the One underlying the many, the Eternal beneath the ephemeral. What is it that makes undivided reality appear to be a world of separate, transient objects? What makes each of us believe that we are the body rather than our own Self? The sages answered with a story still told after thousands of years. Imagine, they said, a man dreaming that he is being attacked by a tiger. His pulse will race, his fists will clench, his forehead will be wet with the dew of fear  all just as if the attack were real. He will be able to describe the look of his tiger, the way he smelled, the sound of his roar. For him the tiger is real, and in a sense he is not wrong: the evidence he has is not qualitatively different from the kind of evidence we trust when we are awake. People have even died from the physiological effects of a potent dream. Only when we wake up can we realize that our  \fdream-sensations, though real to our nervous system, are a lower level of reality than the waking state. The Upanishads delineate three ordinary states of consciousness: waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep. Each is real, but each has a higher order of reality. For beyond these three, the Upanishads say, is the unitive state, called simply the fourth: turiya. Entering this state is similar to waking up out of dream sleep: the individual passes from a lower level of reality to a higher one. The sages called the dream of waking life  the dream of separate, merely physical existence  by a suggestive name, maya. In general use the word meant a kind of magic, the power of a god or sorcerer to make a thing appear to be something else. In the Gita, maya becomes the creative power of the Godhead, the primal creative energy that makes unity appear as the world of innumerable separate things with name and form. Later philosophers explained maya in surprisingly contemporary terms. The mind, they said, observes the so-called outside world and sees its own structure. It reports that the world consists of a multiplicity of separate objects in a framework of time, space, and causality because these are the conditions of perception. In a word, the mind looks at unity and sees diversity; it looks at what is timeless and reports transience. And in fact the percepts of its experience are diverse and transient; on this level of experience, separateness is real. Our mistake is in taking this for ultimate reality, like the dreamer thinking that nothing is real except his dream. Nowhere has this mysterious Eastern notion been formulated more succinctly than in the epigram of Ruysbroeck: We behold what we are, and we are what we behold. When we look at unity through the instruments of the mind, we see diversity; when the mind is transcended, we enter a higher mode of knowing  turiya, the fourth state of consciousness  in which duality disappears. This does not mean, however, that the phenomenal world is an illusion or unreal. The illusion is the sense of separateness. Here again we can illustrate from physics: the world of name and form exists only as a condition of perception; at the subatomic level, separate phenomena dissolve into a flux of energy. The effect of maya is similar. The world of the senses is real, but it must be known for what it is: unity appearing as multiplicity. Those who disidentify themselves with the conditions of perception in maya wake up into a higher mode of knowing in which the unity of life is  \fapprehended directly. The disciplines for achieving this are called yoga, as is the state of union: the word comes from the root yuj, to yoke or bind together. The experience itself (properly speaking, it is beyond experience) is called samadhi. And the state attained is moksha or nirvana, both of which signify going beyond the conditioning of maya  time, space, and causality. In this state we realize that we are not a physical creature but the Atman, the Self, and thus not separate from God. We see the world not as pieces but whole, and we see that whole as a manifestation of God. Once identified with the Self, we know that although the body will die, we will not die; our awareness of this identity is not ruptured by the death of the physical body. Thus we have realized the essential immortality which is the birthright of every human being. To such a person, the Gita says, death is no more traumatic than taking off an old coat (2:22). Life cannot offer any higher realization. The supreme goal of human existence has been attained. The man or woman who realizes God has everything and lacks nothing: having this, they desire nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow (6:22). Life cannot threaten such a person; all it holds is the opportunity to love, to serve, and to give. Dharma, Karma, Rebirth, and Liberation  It has been said that if you understand just two words, dharma and karma, you will have grasped the essence of Hinduism. This is a simplification, but it would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of these concepts. Both are deeply embedded in Hindu thought, and the Gita, like other Hindu scriptures, takes them for granted, not as theoretical premises but as facts of life that can be verified in personal experience. The word dharma means many things, but its underlying sense is that which supports, from the root dhri, to support, hold up, or bear. Generally, dharma implies support from within: the essence of a thing, its virtue, that which makes it what it is. An old story illumines this meaning with the highest ideal of Hinduism. A sage, seated beside the Ganges, notices a scorpion that has fallen into the water. He reaches down and rescues it, only to be stung. Some time later he looks down and sees the scorpion thrashing about in the water again. Once more he reaches down to rescue it, and once more he is stung. A bystander,  \fobserving all this, exclaims, Holy one, why do you keep doing that? Dont you see that the wretched creature will only sting you in return? Of course, the sage replied. It is the dharma of a scorpion to sting. But it is the dharma of a human being to save. On a larger scale, dharma means the essential order of things, an integrity and harmony in the universe and the affairs of life that cannot be disturbed without courting chaos. Thus it means rightness, justice, goodness, purpose rather than chance. Underlying this idea is the oneness of life: the Upanishadic discovery that all things are interconnected because at its deepest level creation is indivisible. This oneness bestows a basic balance on the whole of nature such that any disturbance in one place has to send ripples everywhere, as a perfect bubble, touched lightly in one place, trembles all over until balance is restored. The implications are caught perfectly by those famous lines from John Donne, which deserve to be read now with a fresh eye as not merely great rhetoric but a faithful representation of reality: No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friends or of thine own were; any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee. There is an ancient Sanskrit epigram, Ahimsa paramo dharma: the highest dharma is ahimsa, nonviolence, universal love for all living creatures; for every kind of violence is a violation of dharma, the fundamental law of the unity of life. Thus every act or thought has consequences, which themselves will have consequences; life is the most intricate web of interconnections. This is the law of karma, one of the most important and least understood ideas in ancient Indian thought. Karma is repeated so often in the Gita that I want to illustrate it in some detail: some intuitive sense of karma as an organic law makes Krishnas teachings a good deal clearer. Literally, the Sanskrit karma means something that is done. Often it can be translated as deed or action. The law of karma states simply that every event is both a cause and an effect. Every act has consequences of a similar  \fkind, which in turn have further consequences and so on; and every act, every karma, is also the consequence of some previous karma. This refers not only to physical action but to mental activity as well. In their analysis of the phenomenal world and the world within, the sages of the Upanishads found that there is not merely an accidental but an essential relationship between mental and physical activity. Given appropriate conditions to develop further, thoughts breed actions of the same kind, as a seed can grow only into one particular kind of tree. Baldly put, the law of karma says that whatever you do will come back to you. No one, of course, has the omniscience to see the picture fully. But the idea of a network of connections, far from being occult, is natural and plausible. The law of karma states unequivocally that though we cannot see the connections, we can be sure that everything that happens to us, good and bad, originated once in something we did or thought. We ourselves are responsible for what happens to us, whether or not we can understand how. It follows that we can change what happens to us by changing ourselves; we can take our destiny into our own hands. The physical side of karma, however, only touches the surface of life. To get an inkling of how karma really works, we have to consider the mind. Everything we do produces karma in the mind. In fact, it is in the mind rather than the world that karmas seeds are planted. Aptly, Indian philosophy compares a thought to a seed: very tiny, but it can grow into a huge, deep-rooted, wide-spreading tree. I have seen places where a seed in a crack of a pavement grew into a tree that tore up the sidewalk. It is difficult to remove such a tree, and terribly difficult to undo the effects of a lifetime of negative thinking, which can extend into many other peoples lives. But it can be done, and the purpose of the Gita is to show how. Karma is sometimes considered punitive, a matter of getting ones just desserts. This is accurate enough, but it is much more illuminating to consider karma an educative force whose purpose is to teach the individual to act in harmony with dharma  not to pursue selfish interests at the expense of others, but to contribute to life and consider the welfare of the whole. In this sense life is like a school; one can learn, one can graduate, one can skip a grade or stay behind. As long as a debt of karma remains, however, a person has to keep coming back for further education. That is the basis of samsara, the cycle of birth and death.  \fA good many wrong and misleading words have been written on this subject, largely because of the fascination it seems to hold in the West. Rightly understood, however, reincarnation is not exotic but quite natural. If personality consists of several sheaths, the body being only the outermost, there is no reason why personality should die when the body is shed. The sages of the Upanishads saw personality as a field of forces. Packets of karma to them are forces that have to work themselves out; if the process is interrupted by death, those forces remain until conditions allow them to work again in a new context. Again, sleep can illustrate the dynamics of this idea. In sleep a person passes in and out of two stages, dreaming and dreamless sleep. In the first, consciousness is withdrawn from the body and senses but still engaged in the mind. In dreamless sleep, however, consciousness is withdrawn from the mind as well. Then the thinking process  even the sense of I  is temporarily suspended, and consciousness is said to rest in the Self. In this state a person ceases to be a separate creature, a separate personality. In dreamless sleep, the Upanishads say, a king is not a king nor a pauper poor; no one is old or young, male or female, educated or ignorant. When consciousness returns to the mind, however, the thinking process starts up again, and personality returns to the body. According to this analysis, the ego dies every night. Every morning we pick up our desires where we left off: the same person, yet a little different too. The Upanishads describe dying as a very similar process. Consciousness is withdrawn from the body into the senses, from the senses into the mind, and finally consolidated in the ego; when the body is finally wrenched away, the ego remains, a potent package of desires and karma. And as our last waking thoughts shape our dreams, the contents of the unconscious at the time of death  the residue of all that we have thought and desired and lived for in the past  determine the context of our next life. We take a body again, the sages say, to come back to just the conditions where our desires and karma can be fulfilled. The Self-realized person, however, has no karma to work out, no personal desires; at the time of death he or she is absorbed into the Lord: But they for whom I am the supreme goal, who do all work renouncing self for me and meditate on me with single-hearted devotion, these I  \fwill swiftly rescue from the fragments cycle of birth and death, for their consciousness has entered into me. (12:67) Such a person, the Upanishads stress, can actually shed the body voluntarily when the hour of death arrives, by withdrawing consciousness step by step in full awareness. Some of the Gitas most fascinating verses, for those who can interpret them, are Krishnas instructions on how to die (8:1213). YOGA PSYCHOLOGY  In trying to describe their discoveries, the Upanishadic seers developed a specialized vocabulary. Their terms were later elaborated by mystics who were also brilliant philosophers  Kapila, Shankara, and others, the ancient Indian counterparts of authorities like Augustine and Aquinas in the West. The most useful part of this vocabulary comes from Sankhya, the philosophical system whose practical counterpart is the school of meditation called Yoga. Both are traditionally traced to one towering authority, Kapila, and have much in common with Buddhist philosophy. An ancient saying celebrates their practicality: There is no theory like Sankhya, no practice like Yoga. The Gita does not belong to the Sankhya school or to any other; it is as comprehensive as the Upanishads. But Sankhya provides a precise vocabulary for describing the workings of the mind, and the Gita draws on that vocabulary freely. Sankhya philosophy posits two separate categories: Purusha, spirit, and prakriti, everything else. This is not the Western mind-matter distinction. Prakriti is the field of what can be known objectively, the field of phenomena, the world of whatever has name and form: that is, not only of matter and energy but also of the mind. As physics postulates a unified field from which all phenomena can be derived, Sankhya describes a field that includes mental phenomena as well. Mind, energy, and matter all belong to a field of forces. Purusha, pure spirit, is the knower of this field of phenomena, and belongs to a wholly different order of reality. Only Purusha is conscious  or, rather, Purusha is consciousness itself. What we call mind is only an internal instrument that Purusha uses, just as the body is its external instrument. For practical purposes  at least as far as the Gita is  \fconcerned  Purusha may be regarded as a synonym for Atman. Purusha is the Self, beyond all change, the same in every creature. Matter and Mind  Perhaps I should confess at this point that the paragraphs that follow in this short section are somewhat technical and not necessary for understanding the Gita. They can be skipped by anyone who finds them dry. I include them simply because Sankhyas explanation of mind and matter, when properly understood, makes sense of many subjects in the Gita that might otherwise seem arbitrary: maya, the survival of personality after death, the way karma works through the mind. It accommodates modern physics perfectly and offers promising explanations of mind-body relationships in health and disease. However, Sankhyas way of looking at the mind is very different from our usual physical orientation, and therefore impossible to absorb without reflection. Sankhyas hallmark is a list (sankhya means counting or listing) of twenty-four principles or tattvas (suchnesses) which trace the steps by which unitary, primordial prakriti becomes manifested as the countless forms of mind, matter, and energy that make up the world we live in. The tattvas are listed in the Gita: The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy [prakriti] from which all these evolved. (13:5) I know of no English words to use for most of these twenty-four constituents. Manas corresponds roughly to mind the way that word is commonly used; buddhi is the discriminative faculty, the discriminating intellect; ahamkara, literally I-maker, is the sense of ego. I have used such rough labels in the translation which follows, but really they are technical terms with precise definitions, each associated with a specific function and level of consciousness. Approximations are misleading because they bring in associations from Western philosophy, which has a wholly different orientation. Behind all these categories lies a powerful, practical assumption: Sankhya is not trying to describe physical reality; it is  \fanalyzing consciousness, knowledge, for the sole purpose of unraveling the human beings true identity. So it does not begin with the material universe as something different and separate from the mind that perceives it. It does not talk about sense objects outside us and senses within and then try to get the two together. It begins with one world of experience. Sense objects and senses are not separate; they are two aspects of the same event. Mind, energy, and matter are a continuum, and the universe is not described as it might be in itself, but as it presents itself to the human mind. As they say in the new physics, it is not just an observable universe but a participatory universe. Let me illustrate. This morning I had a fresh mango for breakfast: a large, beautiful, fragrant one which had been allowed to ripen until just the right moment, when the skin was luminous with reds and oranges. You can see from that kind of description that I like mangoes. I must have eaten thousands of them when I was growing up, and I probably know most varieties intimately by their color, shape, flavor, fragrance, and feel. Sankhya would say that this mango I appreciated so much does not exist in the world outside  at least, not with the qualities I ascribed to it. The mango-in-itself, for example, is not red and orange; these are categories of a nervous system that can deal only with a narrow range of radiant energy. My dog Bogart would not see a luscious red and orange mango. He would see some gray mass with no distinguishing features, much less interesting to him than a piece of buttered toast. But my mind takes in messages from five senses and fits them into a precise mango-form in consciousness, and that form  nothing outside  is what I experience. Not that there is no real mango! But what I experience, the objects of my sense perception and my knowing, are in consciousness, nowhere else. A brilliant neuroscientist I was reading recently says something similar in contemporary language: we never really encounter the world; all we experience is our own nervous system. When the Gita says that the material world is made up of five material elements, then, it is talking about the world as we perceive it through our five senses. The objects of this world are in the mind, not outside. Physical objects in this sense require a mental component also: five essences or mental conditions of perception, each corresponding to one of the five senses. From these five tanmatras derive on the one hand the five sense organs, and on the other hand the five material elements. You can see that  \fthe number five and the correspondences of Sankhya are not arbitrary, but reflect the ways we have of sorting electrical information supplied to the brain. Four of these elements have names similar to those from ancient philosophy in the West  earth, air, fire, and water. But if we remember that we are talking about principles of perception rather than earth-stuff, firestuff, and so on, it should become clear that this is not an antiquated theory left behind by the progress of physical science. It is quite sophisticated and accommodates contemporary physical thought rather well, for it recognizes that in the act of knowing, the mind conditions what is known. Senses and sense objects, then, are very intimately related. There is a causal connection, for example, between the things we see and the physical organ of seeing, the eye and its related branches of the nervous system: both depend on the underlying form in the mind that conditions how we perceive light. The objects we see are shaped by the way we see. So senses and sense objects make sense only together: each is incomplete without the other. That is why there is such a strong pull between senses and sense objects. On the other hand, the Gita says, this pull has nothing to do with us  the Self, the knower. When Krishna keeps telling Arjuna to train his mind to be alike in pleasure and pain, he is simply being practical: to discover unity, consciousness has to be withdrawn from the hold of the senses, which ties it to duality. When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. Those who are not affected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. (2:1415) The sensory attraction of pleasure is just an interaction between inert elements of similar stuff, very much like a magnetic pull between two objects. We are not involved. When I look at a fresh, ripe mango, it is natural for my senses to respond; that is their nature. But I should be able to stand aside and watch this interaction with detachment, the way people stand and watch while movers unload a van. In that way I can enjoy what my senses report without ever having to act compulsively on their likes and dislikes.  \fSankhyas explanation of mind and body has profound implications for psychosomatic medicine. In a system where mental phenomena and biochemical events take place in the same field, it is much easier to account for how ways of thinking affect the body. If one idea is central to yoga psychology, it is that thoughts are real and have real, tangible consequences, as we saw in the discussion of karma. Sankhya describes thoughts as packets of potential energy, which grow more and more solid when favorable conditions are present and obstacles are removed. They become desires, then habits, then ways of living with physical consequences. Those consequences may look no more like thoughts than an oak tree looks like an acorn, but the Gita says they are just as intimately related. Just as a seed can grow into only one kind of tree, thoughts can produce effects only of the same nature. Kindness to others, to take just one example, favors a nervous system that is kind to itself. The Forces of Evolution  Sankhya describes prakriti as a field of forces called gunas  a concept that gets a good deal of attention in the Gita. According to Sankhya, the evolution of primordial prakriti into mind and matter begins when the equilibrium of prakriti is disturbed. In Hindu myth this is the dawn of the Day of Brahma (8:1721), a period of explosive expansion not unlike the Big Bang of modern cosmology. At this instant of creation, thrown into imbalance, prakriti differentiates itself into three basic states or qualities of primordial energy. These are the gunas. Every state of matter and mind is a combination of these three: tamas, inertia, rajas, activity, and sattva, harmony or equilibrium. These are only rough translations, for the gunas have no equivalent in any other philosophy I know. The gunas can be illustrated by comparison with the three states of matter in classical physics: solid, liquid, and gas. Tamas is frozen energy, the resistance of inertia. A block of ice has a good deal of energy in the chemical bonds that hold it together, but the energy is locked in, bound up, rigid. When the ice melts, some of that energy is released as the water flows; rajas, activity, is like a swollen river, full of uncontrolled power. And sattva, harmony, can be compared with steam when its power is harnessed. These are very imprecise parallels, but they convey an important point  \fabout the gunas: all three are states of energy, and each can be converted into the others. Guna means strand, and in the Gita the gunas are described as the very fabric of existence, the veil that hides unity in a covering of diversity. Tamas is mayas power of concealment, the darkness or ignorance that hides unitive reality; rajas distracts and scatters awareness, turning it away from reality toward the diversity of the outside world. Thus the gunas are essentially born of the mind. When the minds activity is stilled, we see life as it is. We can also think of the gunas as different levels of consciousness. Tamas, the lowest level, is the vast unconscious, a chaotic dumping ground for the residue of past mental states. Unconscious in this sense has something in common with Jungs collective unconscious, in that it is the repository not only of past experiences but also of our evolutionary heritage, the basic drives of the human beings animal past. This record is shared, of course, by all human beings, and at its deepest levels the unconscious is universal. There is no choice in tamas, no awareness; this is complete ignorance of the unity of life, ignorance of any other need than ones own basic urges. Rajas is what we ordinarily mean by mind, the incessant stream of thought that races along, desiring, worrying, resenting, scheming, competing, frustrating and getting frustrated. Rajas is power released, but uncontrolled and egocentric. Sattva, finally, is the so-called higher mind  detached, unruffled, selfcontrolled. This is not a state of repressive regulation, but the natural harmony that comes with unity of purpose, character, and desire. Negative states of mind do still come up, prompted by tamas and rajas, but there is no need to act on them. According to Sankhya, everything in the world of mind and matter is an expression of all three gunas, with one guna always predominant. This becomes particularly interesting in describing personality as a field of forces. The rajasic person is full of energy; the tamasic person is sluggish, indifferent, insensitive; the sattvic person, calm, resourceful, compassionate, and selfless. Yet all three are always present at some level of awareness, and their proportions change: their interplay is the dynamics of personality. The same individual will have times when he is bursting with energy and times when inertia descends and paralyzes his will, times  \fwhen he is thoughtful and other times when he is moving so fast that he never notices those around him. The person is the same; he is simply experiencing the play of the gunas. As long as he identifies with his body and mind, he is at the mercy of this play. But the Self is not involved in the gunas interaction; it is witness rather than participant: Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. (13:14) The gunas form the basis of the most compassionate account of human nature I have come across in any philosophy or psychology, East or West. They not only explain differences in character; they describe the basic forces of personality and allow the possibility of reshaping ourselves after a higher ideal. Because personality is a process, the human being is constantly remaking himself or herself. Left to itself, the mind goes on repeating the same old habitual patterns of personality. By training the mind, however, anyone can learn to step in and change old ways of thinking; that is the central principle of yoga: Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. (6:5) The Gita speaks of this kind of growth as part of spiritual evolution. In its natural state, consciousness is a continuous flow of awareness. But through the distorting action of the gunas, we have fallen from this native state into fragmented, sometimes stagnant awareness. Seeing through a divided mind, we see life divided wherever we look: separate selves, antagonistic interests, conflicts within ourselves. Evolution, according to the Gita, is a painfully slow return to our native state. First tamas must be transformed into rajas  apathy and insensitiveness into energetic, enthusiastic activity. But the energy of rajas is self-centered and dispersed; it must be harnessed to a higher ideal by the will. Then it becomes sattva, when all this passionate energy is channeled into selfless action. This state is marked by happiness, a calm mind, abundant vitality, and the concentration of genius. But even this is not the end. The goal of evolution is to return to unity: that is, to still the mind. Then the soul rests in pure, unitary consciousness,  \fwhich is a state of permanent joy. In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. (6:20) THE ESSENCE OF THE GITA  The Gita does not present a system of philosophy. It offers something to every seeker after God, of whatever temperament, by whatever path. The reason for this universal appeal is that it is basically practical: it is a handbook for Self-realization and a guide to action. Some scholars will find practicality a tall claim, because the Gita is full of lofty and even abstruse philosophy. Yet even its philosophy is not there to satisfy intellectual curiosity; it is meant to explain to spiritual aspirants why they are asked to undergo certain disciplines. Like any handbook, the Gita makes most sense when it is practiced. As the traditional chapter titles put it, the Gita is brahmavidyayam yogashastra, a textbook on the supreme science of yoga. But yoga is a word with many meanings  as many, perhaps, as there are paths to Selfrealization. What kind of yoga does the Gita teach? The common answer is that it presents three yogas or even four  the four main paths of Hindu mysticism. In jnana yoga, the yoga of knowledge, aspirants use their will and discrimination to disidentify themselves from the body, mind, and senses until they know they are nothing but the Self. The followers of bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion, achieve the same goal by identifying themselves completely with the Lord in love; by and large, this is the path taken by most of the mystics of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. In karma yoga, the yoga of selfless action, the aspirants dissolve their identification with body and mind by identifying with the whole of life, forgetting the finite self in the service of others. And the followers of raja yoga, the yoga of meditation, discipline the mind and senses until the mind-process is suspended in a healing stillness and they merge in the Self. Indians like to classify, and the eighteen chapters of the Gita are said to break into three six-chapter parts. The first third, according to this, deals with karma yoga, the second with jnana yoga, and the last with bhakti yoga: that is, the Gita begins with the way of selfless action, passes into the way of Self-knowledge, and ends with the way of love. This scheme is not tight,  \fand non-Hindu readers may find it difficult to discover in the text. But the themes are there, and Krishna clearly shifts his emphasis as he goes on using this one word yoga. Here he focuses on transcendental knowledge, there on selfless action, here on meditation, there on love. Thus the Gita offers something for every kind of spiritual aspirant, and for two thousand years each of the major schools of Indian philosophy has quoted the Gita in defense of its particular claims. This fluidity sometimes exasperates scholars, who feel the Gita contradicts itself. It also puzzled Arjuna, the faithful representative of you and me. Krishna, he says at the beginning of chapter 3, youve been telling me that knowledge [jnana] is better than action [karma]; so why do you urge me into such terrible action? Your words are inconsistent; they confuse me. Tell me one path to the highest good (3:12). No doubt he speaks for every reader at this point, and for those who go on wanting one path only, the confusion simply grows worse. For those who try to practice the Gita, however, there is a thread of inner consistency running through Krishnas advice. Like a person walking around the same object, the Gita takes more than one point of view. Whenever Krishna describes one of the traditional paths to God he looks at it from the inside, extolling its virtues over the others. For the time being, that is the path; when he talks about yoga, he means that one particular yoga. Thus this ancient word yoga, says Gandhis intimate friend and secretary, Mahadev Desai, is pressed by the Gita into service to mean the entire gamut of human endeavor to storm the gates of heaven. . [It means] the yoking of all the powers of the body and the mind and soul to God; it means the discipline of the intellect, the mind, the emotions, the will, which such a yoking presupposes; it means a poise of the soul which enables one to look at life in all its aspects and evenly. The Gita brings together all the specialized senses of the word yoga to emphasize their common meaning: the sum of what one must do to realize the Self. The thread through Krishnas teaching, the essence of the Gita, can be given in one word: renunciation. This is the common factor in the four yogas. It is a bleak word in English, conjuring up the austerity and self-  \fdeprivation enjoined on the monastic orders  the poverty, chastity, and obedience so perfectly embodied by Francis of Assisi. When the Gita promises freedom through renunciation, the impression most of us get is that we are being asked to give up everything we want out of life; in this drab state, having lost whatever we value, we will be free from sorrow. Who wants that kind of freedom? But this is not at all what the Gita means. It does not even enjoin material renunciation, although it certainly encourages simplicity. As always, its emphasis is on the mind. It teaches that we can become free by giving up not material things, but selfish attachments to material things  and, more important, to people. It asks us to renounce not the enjoyment of life, but the clinging to selfish enjoyment whatever it may cost others. It pleads, in a word, for the renunciation of selfishness in thought, word, and action  a theme that is common to all mystics, West and East alike. Mahatma Gandhi encapsulates the Gitas message in one phrase: nishkama karma, selfless action, work free from any selfish motives. In this special sense, whatever path the Gita is presenting at a given time, it remains essentially a manual of karma yoga, for it is addressed to the person who wants to realize God without giving up an active life in the world. In the Gita the four traditional yogas are not watertight compartments, and in practice, all of them blend and support each other on the path to Self-realization. Nishkama karma means literally work that is without kama, that is, without selfish desire. This word kama  indeed the whole idea of desire in Hindu and Buddhist psychology  is frequently misunderstood. These religions, it is sometimes held, teach an ideal of desireless action, a nirvana equated with the extinction of all desires. This drab view is far from the truth. Desire is the fuel of life; without desire nothing can be achieved, let alone so stupendous a feat as Self-realization. Kama is not desire; it is selfish desire. The Buddha calls it tanha, thirst: the fierce, compulsive craving for personal satisfaction that demands to be slaked at any cost, whether to oneself or to others. Thus the concept also includes what Western mystics call self-will  the naked ego insisting on getting what it wants for its own gratification. The Gita teaches simply that this selfish craving is what makes a person feel separate from the rest of life. When it is extinguished  the literal meaning of nirvana  the mask of the transient, petty empirical ego falls, revealing our real Self.  \fWork hard in the world without any selfish attachment, the Gita counsels, and you will purify your consciousness of self-will. In this way any man or woman can gradually attain freedom from the bondage of selfish conditioning. This is a mental discipline, not just a physical one, and I want to repeat that to understand the Gita, it is important to look beneath the surface of its injunctions and see the mental state involved. Nishkama karma is not good works or philanthropic activity; work can benefit others and still carry a substantial measure of ego involvement. Such work is good, but it is not yoga. It may benefit others, but it will not necessarily benefit the doer. Everything depends on the state of mind. Action without selfish motive purifies the mind: the doer is less likely to be ego-driven later. The same action done with a selfish motive entangles a person further, precisely by strengthening that motive so it is more likely to prompt selfish action again. In the Gita this is said in many ways, and from differences in language it may seem that Krishna is giving different pieces of advice. In practice, however, it becomes evident that these are only various ways of saying the same thing. To begin with, Krishna often tells Arjuna to renounce the fruits of action (karma-phala): You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself  without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. (2:4748) Fruits, of course, means the outcome. What Krishna means is to give up attachment to the results of what you do: that is, to give your best to every undertaking without insisting that the results work out the way you want, or even whether what you do is pleasant or unpleasant. You have the right to action, but not to the fruits of action: each of us has the obligation to act rightly, but no power to dictate what is to come of what we do. Mahatma Gandhi explains with the authority of his personal experience: By detachment I mean that you must not worry whether the desired result follows from your action or not, so long as your motive is pure,  \fyour means correct. Really, it means that things will come right in the end if you take care of the means and leave the rest to Him. But renunciation of fruit, Gandhi warns, in no way means indifference to the result. In regard to every action one must know the result that is expected to follow, the means thereto, and the capacity for it. He who, being thus equipped, is without desire for the result and is yet wholly engrossed in the due fulfillment of the task before him, is said to have renounced the fruits of his action. This attitude frees us completely. Whatever comes  success or failure, praise or blame, victory or defeat  we can give our best with a clear, unruffled mind. Nothing can shake our courage or break our will; no setback can depress us or make us feel burned out. Clearly, as the Gita says, Yoga is skill in action (2:50). Only the person who is utterly detached and utterly dedicated, Gandhi says, is free to enjoy life. Asked to sum up his life in twenty-five words or less, he replied, I can do it in three! and quoted the Isha Upanishad: Renounce and enjoy. Those who are compulsively attached to the results of action cannot really enjoy what they do; they get downcast when things do not work out and cling more desperately when they do. So the Gita classifies the karma of attachment as pleasant at first, but bitter as poison in the end (18:38), because of the painful bondage of conditioning. Again, Krishna repeatedly tells Arjuna to surrender everything to him in love. But this is not different advice, merely different words. Krishna is asking Arjuna to act entirely for His sake, not for any personal gain. The whole point of the path of love is to transform motivation from I, I, I to thou, thou, thou  that is, to surrender selfish attachments by dissolving them in the desire to give. Krishna puts this most beautifully in the famous verses of Chapter 9 which begin, Whatever you do, make it an offering to me (9:27). Do it, that is, not for personal reward but out of love for the Lord, present in every creature. Whatever you eat, whatever worship you perform, whatever you give, whatever you suffer: everything is to be done and given and endured and enjoyed for the sake of the Lord in all, not for ourselves. Manmana: this is the refrain of the Gita. Krishna tells Arjuna repeatedly, Fill your  \fmind with me, focus every thought on me, think of me always; then you will be united with me (see 9:34). The same injunction was given to Moses and reiterated by Jesus and Mohammed. In practical terms, it means that awareness will be integrated down to the deepest recesses of the unconscious, which is precisely the significance of the word yoga. Meister Eckhart says eloquently of this state: Whoever has God in mind, simply and solely God, in all things, such a man carries God with him into all his works and into all places, and God alone does all his works. He seeks nothing but God; nothing seems good to him but God. He becomes one with God in every thought. Just as no multiplicity can dissipate God, so nothing can dissipate this man or make him multiple. Thus we arrive at the idea of actionless action: of persons so established in identification with the Self that in the midst of tireless service of those around them, they remain in inner peace, the still witness of action. They do not act, the Gita says; it is the Self that acts through them: They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved (13:29). Again, this is a universal testimony. Here is one of the most active of mystics, St. Catherine of Genoa: When the soul is naughted and transformed, then of herself she neither works nor speaks nor wills, nor feels nor hears nor understands; neither has she of herself the feeling of outward or inward, where she may move. And in all things it is God who rules and guides her, without the mediation of any creature. And the state of this soul is then a feeling of such utter peace and tranquility that it seems to her that her heart, and her bodily being, and all both within and without, is immersed in an ocean of utmost peace. . And she is so full of peace that though she press her flesh, her nerves, her bones, no other thing comes forth from them than peace. Again, when the Gita talks about inaction in the midst of action (4:18, etc.), we can call on Ruysbroeck to illumine the seeming paradox. The person who has realized God, he says, mirrors both His aspects: tranquility according to His essence, activity according to His nature: absolute repose, absolute fecundity. And he adds,  \fThe interior person lives his life according to these two ways; that is to say, in rest and in work. And in each of them he is wholly and undividedly; for he dwells wholly in God in virtue of his restful fruition and wholly in himself in virtue of his active love. . This is the supreme summit of the inner life. This is the only kind of inaction the Gita recommends. It is action of the most tireless kind; the only thing inactive is the ego. To live without the daily sacrifice (yajna) of selfless service  to work just for oneself, or worse, to do nothing at all  is simply to be a thief (3:12). It is not possible to do nothing, Krishna says; the very nature of the mind is incessant activity. The Gitas goal is to harness this activity in selfless service, removing the poisonous agency of the ego: As long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward (18:11). Meister Eckhart explains, To be right, a person must do one of two things: either he must learn to have God in his work and hold fast to him there, or he must give up his work altogether. Since, however, man cannot live without activities that are both human and various, we must learn to keep God in everything we do, and whatever the job or place, keep on with him, letting nothing stand in our way. It would be difficult to find a better summary of the Gitas message anywhere  and this, incidentally, from someone considered to represent the path of knowledge. Krishna wraps all this up in one famous verse: Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve (18:66). Krishna is the Self; the words mean simply to cast aside external props and dependencies and rely on the Self alone, seeking strength nowhere but within. Why does selfless action lead to Self-realization? It is not a matter of good action being divinely rewarded. Self-realization is not some kind of compensation for good deeds. We can understand the dynamics if we remember that the Gitas emphasis is on the mind. Most human activity, good and bad, is tainted by ego-involvement. Such activity cannot purify consciousness, because it goes on generating new karma in the mind  in  \fpractical terms, we go on getting entangled in what we do. Selfless work purifies consciousness because when there is no trace of ego involvement, new karma is not produced; the mind is simply working out the karma it has already accumulated. Shankara illustrates this with the simile of a potters wheel. The egos job is to go on incessantly spinning the wheel of the mind and making karmapots: new ideas to act on, fresh desires to pursue. When this pointless activity stops, no more pots are made, but for a while the wheel of the mind goes on spinning out of the momentum of its past karma. This is an anguishing period in the life of every mystic: you have done everything you can; now you can only wait with a kind of impatient patience. Eventually, for no reason that one can understand, the wheel does come to a stop, dissolving the mind-process in samadhi. A HIGHER IMAGE  Perhaps the clearest way to grasp the Gita is to look at the way it describes those who embody its teachings. There are portraits like this at the beginning of the Gita, the middle, and the end, each offering a model of our full human potential. The first is given at the end of chapter 2 (2:5472), verses which Gandhi said hold the key to the entire Gita. Arjuna has just been told about Selfknowledge; now he asks a very practical question: when a person attains this knowledge, how does it show? How do such people conduct themselves in everyday life? We expect a list of virtues. Instead, Krishna delivers a surprise: the surest sign is that they have banished all selfish desires. Their senses and mind are completely trained, so they are free from sensory cravings and self-will. Identified completely with the Self, not with body or mind, they realize their immortality here on earth. The implications of this are not spelled out; we have to see them in a living person. G. K. Chesterton once said that to understand the Sermon on the Mount, we should look not at Christ but at St. Francis. To understand the Gita I went to look at Mahatma Gandhi, who had done his best for forty years to translate those verses into his daily life. Seeing him, I understood that those who see themselves in all and all in them would simply not be capable of harming others. Augustine says daringly, Love, then do as you like: nothing will come out of you but goodness. I saw too what it meant to view ones body with detachment: not indifference, but compassionate care  \fas an instrument of service. I saw what it means to rest in the midst of intense action. Most important, I grasped one of the most refreshing ideas in Hindu mysticism: original goodness. Since the Self is the core of every personality, no one needs to acquire goodness or compassion; they are already there. All that is necessary is to remove the selfish habits that hide them. Chapter 12 gives another portrait in its closing verses (12:1320), and here we do get an inspiring list of the marks of those who follow the path of love: That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure and pain, patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me  with such as these I am in love. (12:1314) And finally comes the passionate description with which the Gita ends, when Krishna tells Arjuna how to recognize the man or woman who has reached lifes supreme goal: One who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action. Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom. (18:4950) These are not separate paths, separate ideals. All three passages describe one person: vital, active, compassionate, self-reliant in the highest sense, for he looks to the Self for everything and needs nothing from life but the opportunity to give. In brief, such a person knows who he is, and in that knowing is everything. This is not running away from life, as is so often claimed. It is running into life, open-handed, open-armed: flying, running, and rejoicing, says Thomas  Kempis, for he is free and will not be bound, never entangled in self-doubts, conflict, or vacillation. Far from being desireless  look at Gandhi, St. Catherine of Siena, St. Teresa, St. Francis  the man or woman who realizes God has yoked all human passions to the overriding desire to give and love and serve; and in that unification we can see, not the  \fextinction of personality, but its full blossoming. This is what it means to be fully human; our ordinary lives of stimulus and response, getting and spending, seem by comparison as faint as remembered dreams. This flowering of the spirit appeals, I think, to everyone. This is the true joy in life, says Bernard Shaw: the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one; . . the being a force of Nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. Instead of Nature with a capital N, of course, the Gita would say an instrument of the Self; but that is the only difference. One of the most appealing features of the Gita for our times is that it clears up misunderstandings about the spiritual life and shows it for what it is: active, joyful, intentional, a middle path between extremes that transfigures everyday living. FAITH AND SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION  One last untranslatable concept and I will let the Gita speak for itself. That concept is shraddha, and its nearest English equivalent is faith. I have translated it as such, but shraddha means much more. It is literally that which is placed in the heart: all the beliefs we hold so deeply that we never think to question them. It is the set of values, axioms, prejudices, and prepossessions that colors our perceptions, governs our thinking, dictates our responses, and shapes our lives, generally without our even being aware of its presence and power. This may sound philosophical, but shraddha is not an intellectual abstraction. It is our very substance. The Gita says, A person is what his shraddha is (17:3). The Bible uses almost the same words: As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he. Shraddha reflects everything that we have made ourselves and points to what we have become. But there is nothing passive about shraddha. It is full of potency, for it prompts action, conditions behavior, and determines how we see and therefore respond to the world around us. When Norman Cousins talks about a belief system analogous to the bodys organ systems, that is one aspect of shraddha; he is referring to the  \fpower to heal or harm that is inherent in our ideas of ourselves. One person with a serious illness believes he has a contribution to make to the world and so he recovers; another believes his life is worthless and he dies: that is the power of shraddha. Similarly, self-image is part of shraddha. One person believes she will succeed in life and overcomes great obstacles; another, who believes she can do nothing, may be more gifted and face fewer difficulties but accomplish very little. Yet shraddha is not brute determination or wishful thinking. When St. John of the Cross says We live in what we love, he is explaining shraddha. This is our world. Our lives are an eloquent expression of our belief: what we deem worth having, doing, attaining, being. What we strive for shows what we value; we back our shraddha with our time, our energy, our very lives. Thus shraddha determines destiny. As the Buddha puts it, All that we are is the result of what we have thought. We are made of our thoughts; we are molded by our thoughts. As we think, so we become. This is true not only of individuals but of societies, institutions, and civilizations, according to the dominant ideas that shape their actions. Faith in technology, for example, is part of the shraddha of modern civilization. Right shraddha, according to the Gita, is faith in spiritual laws: in the unity of life, the presence of divinity in every person, the essentially spiritual nature of the human being. Wrong shraddha is not necessarily morally wrong, merely ignorant. It means believing that there is no more to life than physical existence, that the human being is only a biochemical entity, that happiness can be got by pursuing private interests and ignoring the rest of life. Such beliefs are misplaced: we have attached our shraddha to beliefs that life cannot bear out. Sooner or later they must prove false, and then our shraddha changes. Like our thinking, therefore  like we ourselves  shraddha evolves. The purpose of karma is to teach the consequences of shraddha, so that by trial and error, life after life, the individual soul acquires the kind of faith that leads to fulfillment of lifes supreme goal. Krishna explains the dynamics: When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that. Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. (7:21 22)  \fThis is perhaps the most compassionate insight into human evolution ever expressed. The Gita is steeped in it, but it is not exclusive to the Gita or to Hinduism. Whether you like it or not, whether you know it or not, says Meister Eckhart, secretly Nature seeks and hunts and tries to ferret out the track in which God may be found. The whole purpose of every experience, every activity, every faculty, is to turn the human being inward and lead each of us back to our divine source. Thus every person seeking satisfaction in the world outside  pleasure, power, profit, prestige  is really looking for God: As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me (4:11). Two forces pervade human life, the Gita says: the upward thrust of evolution and the downward pull of our evolutionary past. Ultimately, then, the Gita is not a book of commandments but a book of choices. It does mention sin, but mostly it talks about ignorance and its consequences. Krishna tells Arjuna about the Self, the forces of the mind, the relationship between thought and action, the law of karma, and then concludes, Now, Arjuna, reflect on these words and then do as you choose (18:63). The struggle is between two halves of human nature, and choices are posed every moment. Everyone who has accepted this challenge, I think, will testify that life offers no fiercer battle than this war within. We have no choice about the fighting; it is built into human nature. But we do have the choice of which side to fight on: Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. If you egotistically say, I will not fight this battle, your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. (18:5859) Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. (8:7) Thus the Gita places human destiny entirely in human hands. Its world is not deterministic, but neither is it an expression of blind chance: we shape ourselves and our world by what we believe and think and act on, whether for good or for ill. In this sense the Gita opens not on Kurukshetra but on dharmakshetra, the field of dharma, where Arjuna and Krishna are standing for us all.  \fChapter_one  The War Within Sri Krishna consoles and instructs Prince Arjuna as he is about to go into battle against family and friends to defend his older brothers claim to the ancient throne of the Kurus. Thus the great scripture called Bhagavad Gita, the Song of the Lord, begins. Sri Krishna is Bhagavan, the Lord, the mysterious incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the aspect of God who fosters and preserves the universe against the forces constantly working to destroy and corrupt it. Krishna has appeared on earth as a royal prince of the house of the Yadavas; thus he combines earthly majesty with a hidden spiritual power. Most know him only as an unimportant prince, but the wise have seen him reveal his power to destroy evil and protect the good. The battle of the Bhagavad Gita is not Krishnas fight, however; it is Arjunas. Krishna is only Arjunas charioteer and advisor. He has promised Arjuna that he will be with him throughout the ordeal, but much as he passionately hopes for Arjunas victory, he has sworn to be a noncombatant in the struggle. A charioteers position is a lowly one compared to the status and glory of the warrior he drives, but Krishna assumes this modest role out of love for Arjuna. As charioteer, he is in a perfect position to give advice and encouragement to Arjuna without violating his promise not to join the fight himself. To secure their claim to the throne, Arjuna and his brothers must fight not an alien army but their own cousins, who have held the kingdom for many years. Tragically, the forces against them include their own uncle, the blind king Dhritarashtra, and even the revered teachers and elders who guided Arjuna and his brothers when they were young. Arjuna, of course, wants to win the throne for his brother, who is the rightful heir to the Kuru dynasty and has endured many wrongs. But he is dismayed at the prospect of fighting his own people. Thus, on the morning the great battle is to begin, he turns to Krishna, his friend and spiritual advisor, and asks him the deeper questions about life that he has never asked before. The Bhagavad Gita is Krishnas answer. Other warriors who appear elsewhere in the drama are mentioned in this first chapter of the Gita. To Indians these are familiar figures from the  \flegendary past, but to most Western readers they will be unknown and even unpronounceable names. Arjuna and his brothers are known as the Pandavas, the sons of Pandu: Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Sahadeva, and Nakula. The other side is called the Kauravas, the sons of Kuru. This is somewhat misleading, for both sides of the royal family are Kurus by birth. But the Pandavas are now in the position of appearing to be the dissident faction, so they are called sons of Pandu to distinguish them from the larger family. Pandu was once king of the kingdom of Hastinapura, but he retired into the forest on spiritual retreat and died young. His elder brother, Dhritarashtra, was blind since birth, so he was never named ruler, but he did share power with his brother. When Pandu died his eldest son, Yudhishthira, should have succeeded him; but because Yudhishthira was only a boy, Dhritarashtra continued on after Pandus death. As time passed, however, Dhritarashtras attachment to his own eldest son, Duryodhana, gradually overcame him. Instead of rising to royal impartiality and allowing Yudhishthira his fair claim, the old, blind king began to connive at his sons demand to succeed to the throne. Actually, the line of succession had grown convoluted over several generations, and it was not unthinkable that Duryodhana should rule next. But Yudhishthiras outstanding qualities and Duryodhanas corruption gradually decided the issue, at least from the moral point of view. For Duryodhana, the conflict could be resolved only on the battlefield. Other warriors are mentioned briefly in chapter 1. Two particularly important figures in the Mahabharata story are Drona and Bhishma. Drona was born a brahmin, a member of the priestly caste, but in search of wealth he took up the way of the warrior and excelled in the knowledge of arms. He was the teacher, the guru, of all the royal princes in their youth, the sons of Pandu and the sons of Dhritarashtra alike. Thus it was he who taught both sides the skills of war  an irony which sharp-tongued Duryodhana points out in verse 3. Arjuna was Dronas best pupil when it came to the bow, excelling even Dronas own son, Ashvatthama. Bhishma, the grandsire of both sides, is not actually the princes grandfather but a respected elder statesman. As Dhritarashtras advisor of many years standing, he considers it his duty to stand by his king and try to protect him from his weaknesses and wrong decisions.  \fAnother figure introduced in chapter 1 is Sanjaya, who narrates the entire Gita to the blind king Dhritarashtra. Sanjaya is not present on the battlefield, but the text tells us that the sage Vyasa, the composer of the Gita, has given him divine sight so that he can see and report everything. Chapter 1 leaves us acutely aware that we are on a battlefield, waiting for a catastrophic war to begin; but once Krishna begins his instruction, we leave the battlefield behind and enter the realms of philosophy and mystical vision. The first chapter is but a bridge to the real subjects of the Gita, and thus need not detain us too long in our study of the poem. Yet the first chapter has caused a great deal of debate, largely because of what it has to say about the morality of war. Basically there have been two points of view, which are almost (but perhaps not completely) irreconcilable. First, there is the orthodox Hindu viewpoint that the Gita condones war for the warrior class: it is the dharma, the moral duty, of soldiers to fight in a good cause, though never for evil leaders. (It should be added that this is part of an elaborate and highly chivalrous code prescribing the just rules of war.) According to this orthodox view, the lesson of the Mahabharata (and therefore of the Gita) is that although war is evil, it is an evil that cannot be avoided  an evil both tragic and honorable for the warrior himself. War in a just cause, justly waged, is also in accord with the divine will. Because of this, in the Mahabharata, Yudhishthira and his noble brothers find their peace in the next world when they have finished their duty on earth. The mystics point of view is more subtle. For them the battle is an allegory, a cosmic struggle between good and evil. Krishna has revealed himself on earth to reestablish righteousness, and he is asking Arjuna to engage in a spiritual struggle, not a worldly one. According to this interpretation, Arjuna is asked to fight not his kith and kin but his own lower self. Mahatma Gandhi, who based his daily life on the Gita from his twenties on, felt it would be impossible to live the kind of life taught in the Gita and still engage in violence. To argue that the Gita condones violence, he said, was to give importance only to its opening verses  its preface, so to speak  and ignore the scripture itself. For some, it helps clarify this question to look upon the Gita as an Upanishad, a mystical statement from the Vedas, that was incorporated into the warrior epic of a later age. Chapter 1 of the Gita then forms a rather  \fperilous bridge between the warriors world and the essential part of the Gita  Sri Krishnas revelations of spiritual truth.   \f1: The War Within DHRITARASHTRA  O Sanjaya, tell me what happened at Kurukshetra, the field of dharma, where my family and the Pandavas gathered to fight. 1  SANJAYA  Having surveyed the forces of the Pandavas arrayed for battle, prince Duryodhana approached his teacher, Drona, and spoke. 3 O my teacher, look at this mighty army of the Pandavas, assembled by your own gifted disciple, Yudhishthira. 4 There are heroic warriors and great archers who are the equals of Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana, Virata, the mighty Drupada, 5 Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja,the great leader Shaibya, 6 the powerful Yudhamanyu, the valiant Uttamaujas, and the son of Subhadra, in addition to the sons of Draupadi. All these command mighty chariots. 2  O best of brahmins, listen to the names of those who are distinguished among our own forces: 8 Bhishma, Karna, and the victorious Kripa; Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta. 7  There are many others, too, heroes giving up their lives for my sake, all proficient in war and armed with a variety of weapons. 10 Our army is unlimited and commanded by Bhishma; theirs is small and commanded by Bhima. 11 Let everyone take his proper place and stand firm supporting Bhishma! 9  Then the powerful Bhishma, the grandsire, oldest of all the Kurus, in order to cheer Duryodhana, roared like a lion and blew his 12  \fconch horn. 13 And after Bhishma, a tremendous noise arose of conchs and cow horns and pounding on drums. Then Sri Krishna and Arjuna, who were standing in a mighty chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conchs. 15 Sri Krishna blew the conch named Panchajanya, and Arjuna blew that called Devadatta. The mighty Bhima blew the huge conch Paundra. 16 Yudhishthira, the king, the son of Kunti, blew the conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conchs as well. 17 Then the king of Kashi, the leading bowman, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the invincible Satyaki, 18 Drupada, all the sons of Draupadi, and the strong-armed son of Subhadra joined in, 19 and the noise tore through the heart of Duryodhanas army. Indeed, the sound was tumultuous, echoing throughout heaven and earth. 14  Then, O Dhritarashtra, lord of the earth, having seen your sons forces set in their places and the fighting about to begin, Arjuna spoke these words to Sri Krishna: 20  ARJUNA  O Krishna, drive my chariot between the two armies. 22 I want to see those who desire to fight with me. With whom will this battle be fought? 23 I want to see those assembled to fight for Duryodhana, those who seek to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra by engaging in war. 21  SANJAYA  Thus Arjuna spoke, and Sri Krishna, driving his splendid chariot between the two armies, 25 facing Bhishma and Drona and all the kings of the earth, said: Arjuna, behold all the Kurus gathered together. 24  And Arjuna, standing between the two armies, saw fathers and grandfathers, teachers, uncles, and brothers, sons and grandsons, 27 in-laws and friends. Seeing his kinsmen established in opposition, 28 Arjuna was overcome by sorrow. Despairing, he spoke these words: 26  \fARJUNA  O Krishna, I see my own relations here anxious to fight, 29 and my limbs grow weak; my mouth is dry, my body shakes, and my hair is standing on end. 30 My skin burns, and the bow Gandiva has slipped from my hand. I am unable to stand; my mind seems to be whirling. 31 These signs bode evil for us. I do not see that any good can come from killing our relations in battle. 32 O Krishna, I have no desire for victory, or for a kingdom or pleasures. Of what use is a kingdom or pleasure or even life, 33 if those for whose sake we desire these things  34 teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, in-laws, grandsons, and others with family ties  are engaging in this battle, renouncing their wealth and their lives? 35 Even if they were to kill me, I would not want to kill them, not even to become ruler of the three worlds. How much less for the earth alone? O Krishna, what satisfaction could we find in killing Dhritarashtras sons? We would become sinners by slaying these men, even though they are evil. 37 The sons of Dhritarashtra are related to us; therefore, we should not kill them. How can we gain happiness by killing members of our own family? 36  Though they are overpowered by greed and see no evil in destroying families or injuring friends, we see these evils. 39 Why shouldnt we turn away from this sin? 40 When a family declines, ancient traditions are destroyed. With them are lost the spiritual foundations for life, and the family loses its sense of unity. 41 Where there is no sense of unity, the women of the family become corrupt; and with the corruption of its women, society is plunged into chaos. 42 Social chaos is hell for the family and for those who have destroyed the family as well. It disrupts the process of spiritual evolution begun by our ancestors. 43 The timeless spiritual foundations of family and society would be destroyed by these terrible deeds, which violate the unity of life. 38  It is said that those whose family dharma has been destroyed dwell in hell. 45 This is a great sin! We are prepared to kill our own relations out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. 46 Better for 44  \fme if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, were to attack me in battle and kill me unarmed and unresisting. SANJAYA  Overwhelmed by sorrow, Arjuna spoke these words. And casting away his bow and his arrows, he sat down in his chariot in the middle of the battlefield. 47  \fChapter_two  Self-Realization As Arjunas spiritual teacher, Sri Krishnas task now is to rouse Arjuna from his despair and set him on the way to Self-realization. Arjuna is essentially a man of action, renowned for his bravery, nobility, and skill in the arts of war  intelligent, but not given to reflection. Yet in his present crisis, he finds that the active life is not enough. He is forced to ask the perennial questions about life and death: Does he have a soul? Does it survive death? Is there a deeper reality than we perceive in the world around us? If so, is it possible to know it directly, and (for Arjuna is always practical) what effect does such knowing have in everyday life? In his answer, Krishna touches on almost all the main themes and concepts of the Gita. Chapter 2 is thus a kind of overview of the sixteen chapters to come. Sri Krishna begins by reminding Arjuna of his immortal nature: his real Self, the Atman, never dies, for it is never born; it is eternal. Thus the Gita does not lead us from stage to stage of spiritual awareness, but begins with the ultimate premise: the immortal soul is more important than the passing world. Knowing he is out of his depth in these inner realms of the mind and spirit, Arjuna formally asks Krishna to be his spiritual teacher or guru. This is a basic prerequisite of a disciples initiation in the Hindu tradition, where it is believed that virtually all seekers need the guidance of an experienced teacher. Arjuna is no exception, and he is fortunate to have Krishna himself as his guru. In the allegorical sense, Krishna is a symbol of the Atman, Arjunas deepest Self. This chapter introduces the idea of rebirth or samsara. The Self wears the body as a garment; when the garment is old, it is cast aside and a new one is put on. Thus the soul, or jiva, travels from life to life. Just as death is certain for the living, rebirth is certain for the dead. Krishna assures Arjuna that his basic nature is not subject to time and death; yet he reminds him that he cannot realize this truth if he cannot see beyond the dualities of life: pleasure and pain, success and failure, even heat and cold. The Gita does not teach a spirituality aimed at an enjoyable life in the hereafter, nor does it  \fteach a way to enhance power in this life or the next. It teaches a basic detachment from pleasure and pain, as this chapter says more than once. Only in this way can an individual rise above the conditioning of lifes dualities and identify with the Atman, the immortal Self. Also, the Gita does not teach an enlightenment based on a knowledge of the scriptures. The important thing is direct mystical experience, which Krishna will later urge Arjuna to acquire for himself. This chapter establishes the various definitions of yoga taught in the Gita. Here the word does not refer to the physical postures and exercises (hatha yoga) it connotes in the West; it refers primarily to disciplining the mind. Yoga is evenness of mind: detachment from the dualities of pain and pleasure, success and failure. Therefore yoga is skill in action, because this kind of detachment is required if one is to act in freedom, rather than merely react to events compelled by conditioning. Krishna is not trying to persuade Arjuna to lead a different kind of life and renounce the world as would a monk or recluse. He tells Arjuna that if he can establish himself in yoga  in unshakable equanimity, profound peace of mind  he will be more effective in the realm of action. His judgment will be better and his vision clear if he is not emotionally entangled in the outcome of what he does. Arjuna now asks his first question as Krishnas student. His teacher has been talking about spiritual wisdom: direct, experiential knowledge of the immortal Self. Arjuna wants to know what difference this kind of wisdom makes in everyday life. If a person establishes an ever-present awareness of the core of divinity within himself, how does it affect the way he lives? Arjuna is not interested in what people believe, but in how they conduct themselves in life. Krishnas answer (2:55 72 ) is one of the most quoted passages in the Gita. Mahatma Gandhi said these verses contain the essence of the Gita: if the rest of the scripture were lost, this passage alone would be enough to teach a complete way of life. Those who are established in wisdom (sthitaprajna) live in continuous, unbroken awareness that they are not the perishable body but the Atman. Further, they see the same Self in everyone, for the Atman is universally present in all. Such a one, Krishna says, does not identify with personal desires. These desires are on the surface of personality, and the Self is its very core. The Self-realized man or woman is not motivated by personal desires  in other words, by any desire for kama, personal satisfaction. This idea is perhaps  \fforeign to modern ways of thinking, but basic to the Gita  and, indeed, to mystics of all traditions. More specifically, the word kama refers to any gratification of the ego or the senses that entangles us in the world of samsara, and thus draws us away from the core of our being, the Self. Those established in Selfrealization control their senses instead of letting their senses control them. If the senses are not controlled, Krishna warns, the mind (or emotions) will follow wherever they lead. Eventually a person following the senses loses strength of will and unity of purpose; his choices are dictated by his desires. When the will is led astray by the desire for pleasure, the mind becomes confused and scattered. Ultimately, Krishna warns, this leads to spiritual destruction: When you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste. (2:62 63 ) Yet the Gita does not recommend asceticism. It is more a matter of training the body, mind, and senses. At the very close of the chapter, Krishna introduces the idea that it is not enough to master all selfish desires; it is also necessary to subdue possessiveness and egocentricity. If this ultimate bourne can be passed, then the seeker will know the true, immortal Self within. This is the mystics supreme goal: knowing their real nature, they know their own immortality and realize their union with eternal Being.   \f2: Self-Realization SANJAYA  These are the words that Sri Krishna spoke to the despairing Arjuna, whose eyes were burning with tears of pity and confusion. 1  KRISHNA  This despair and weakness in a time of crisis are mean and unworthy of you, Arjuna. How have you fallen into a state so far from the path to liberation? 3 It does not become you to yield to this weakness. Arise with a brave heart and destroy the enemy. 2  ARJUNA  How can I ever bring myself to fight against Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of reverence? How can I, Krishna? 5 Surely it would be better to spend my life begging than to kill these great and worthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would be tainted. 6 I dont even know which would be better, for us to conquer them or for them to conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashtra have confronted us; but why would we care to live if we killed them? 4  My will is paralyzed, and I am utterly confused. Tell me which is the better path for me. Let me be your disciple. I have fallen at your feet; give me instruction. 8 What can overcome a sorrow that saps all my vitality? Even power over men and gods or the wealth of an empire seem empty. 7  SANJAYA  \fThis is how Arjuna, the great warrior, spoke to Sri Krishna. With the words, O Krishna, I will not fight, he fell silent. 10 As they stood between the two armies, Sri Krishna smiled and replied to Arjuna, who had sunk into despair. 9  KRISHNA  You speak sincerely, but your sorrow has no cause. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. 12 There has never been a time when you and I and the kings gathered here have not existed, nor will there be a time when we will cease to exist. 13 As the same person inhabits the body through childhood, youth, and old age, so too at the time of death he attains another body. The wise are not deluded by these changes. 11  When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. 15 Those who are unaffected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. Assert your strength and realize this! 14  The impermanent has no reality; reality lies in the eternal. Those who have seen the boundary between these two have attained the end of all knowledge. 17 Realize that which pervades the universe and is indestructible; no power can affect this unchanging, imperishable reality. 18 The body is mortal, but that which dwells in the body is immortal and immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, fight in this battle. 16  One believes he is the slayer, another believes he is the slain. Both are ignorant; there is neither slayer nor slain. 20 You were never born; you will never die. You have never changed; you can never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, you do not die when the body dies. 21 Realizing that which is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and unchanging, how can you slay or cause another to slay? 19  \fAs one abandons worn-out clothes and acquires new ones, so when the body is worn out a new one is acquired by the Self, who lives within. 22  The Self cannot be pierced by weapons or burned by fire; water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it. 24 The Self cannot be pierced or burned, made wet or dry. It is everlasting and infinite, standing on the motionless foundations of eternity. 25 The Self is unmanifested, beyond all thought, beyond all change. Knowing this, you should not grieve. 23  O mighty Arjuna, even if you believe the Self to be subject to birth and death, you should not grieve. 27 Death is inevitable for the living; birth is inevitable for the dead. Since these are unavoidable, you should not sorrow. 28 Every creature is unmanifested at first and then attains manifestation. When its end has come, it once again becomes unmanifested. What is there to lament in this? 26  The glory of the Self is beheld by a few, and a few describe it; a few listen, but many without understanding. 30 The Self of all beings, living within the body, is eternal and cannot be harmed. Therefore, do not grieve. 29  Considering your dharma, you should not vacillate. For a warrior, nothing is higher than a war against evil. 32 The warrior confronted with such a war should be pleased, Arjuna, for it comes as an open gate to heaven. 33 But if you do not participate in this battle against evil, you will incur sin, violating your dharma and your honor. 31  The story of your dishonor will be repeated endlessly: and for a man of honor, dishonor is worse than death. 35 These brave warriors will think you have withdrawn from battle out of fear, and those who formerly esteemed you will treat you with disrespect. 36 Your enemies will ridicule your strength and say things that should not be said. What could be more painful than this? 34  Death means the attainment of heaven; victory means the enjoyment of the earth. Therefore rise up, Arjuna, resolved to fight! 37  \fHaving made yourself alike in pain and pleasure, profit and loss, victory and defeat, engage in this great battle and you will be freed from sin. 38  You have heard the intellectual explanation of Sankhya, Arjuna; now listen to the principles of yoga. By practicing these you can break through the bonds of karma. 40 On this path effort never goes to waste, and there is no failure. Even a little effort toward spiritual awareness will protect you from the greatest fear. 39  Those who follow this path, resolving deep within themselves to seek me alone, attain singleness of purpose. For those who lack resolution, the decisions of life are many-branched and endless. 41  There are ignorant people who speak flowery words and take delight in the letter of the law, saying that there is nothing else. 43 Their hearts are full of selfish desires, Arjuna. Their idea of heaven is their own enjoyment, and the aim of all their activities is pleasure and power. The fruit of their actions is continual rebirth. 44 Those whose minds are swept away by the pursuit of pleasure and power are incapable of following the supreme goal and will not attain samadhi. 42  The scriptures describe the three gunas. But you should be free from the action of the gunas, established in eternal truth, selfcontrolled, without any sense of duality or the desire to acquire and hoard. 45  Just as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is flooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined man or woman, who sees the Lord everywhere. 46  You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. 48 Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself  without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. 47  \fSeek refuge in the attitude of detachment and you will amass the wealth of spiritual awareness. Those who are motivated only by desire for the fruits of action are miserable, for they are constantly anxious about the results of what they do. 50 When consciousness is unified, however, all vain anxiety is left behind. There is no cause for worry, whether things go well or ill. Therefore, devote yourself to the disciplines of yoga, for yoga is skill in action. 49  The wise unify their consciousness and abandon attachment to the fruits of action, which binds a person to continual rebirth. Thus they attain a state beyond all evil. 51  When your mind has overcome the confusion of duality, you will attain the state of holy indifference to things you hear and things you have heard. 53 When you are unmoved by the confusion of ideas and your mind is completely united in deep samadhi, you will attain the state of perfect yoga. 52  ARJUNA  Tell me of those who live established in wisdom, ever aware of the Self, O Krishna. How do they talk? How sit? How move about? 54  KRISHNA  They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them, who have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving tormenting the heart. 55  Neither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live free from lust and fear and anger. Established in meditation, they are truly wise. 57 Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are neither elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. Such are the seers. 56  Even as a tortoise draws in its limbs, the wise can draw in their senses at will. 59 Aspirants abstain from sense pleasures, but they still crave for them. These cravings all disappear when they see the highest goal. 60 Even of those who tread the path, the stormy senses 58  \fcan sweep off the mind. 61 They live in wisdom who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in me. When you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. 63 Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste. 64 But when you move amidst the world of sense, free from attachment and aversion alike, 65 there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you live in the wisdom of the Self. 62  The disunited mind is far from wise; how can it meditate? How be at peace? When you know no peace, how can you know joy? 67 When you let your mind follow the call of the senses, they carry away your better judgment as storms drive a boat off its charted course on the sea. 66  Use all your power to free the senses from attachment and aversion alike, and live in the full wisdom of the Self. 69 Such a sage awakes to light in the night of all creatures. That which the world calls day is the night of ignorance to the wise. 68  As rivers flow into the ocean but cannot make the vast ocean overflow, so flow the streams of the sense-world into the sea of peace that is the sage. But this is not so with the desirer of desires. 70  They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away from the ego-cage of I, me, and mine to be united with the Lord. 72 This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality. 71  \fChapter_three  Selfless Service The title of this chapter in Sanskrit is Karma Yoga, The Way of Action, and here we take an apparently sharp turn away from the subject of the previous chapter. In fact, Arjuna changes the subject completely. Krishna has been trying to convince him that he has an immortal soul, but Arjuna continues to worry about his immediate predicament. It is not that he is uninterested in mystical enlightenment, but his main concern at the moment is just what he is supposed to do next. Or, he asks, perhaps what he does is not so important after all. Has Krishna been telling him to concentrate on acquiring spiritual wisdom and to forget about his apparent duties in the world? Krishna replies that there is no way Arjuna can avoid the obligation of selfless action, or karma yoga. Arjuna must act selflessly, out of a sense of duty. He must work not for his own sake, but for the welfare of all. Krishna points out that this is a basic law underlying all creation. Each being must do its part in the grand scheme of things, and there is no way to avoid this obligation  except perhaps by the complete enlightenment which loosens all the old bonds of karma. Here the Gita refers to the doctrine of karma, one of the basic teachings in all Hindu and Buddhist scriptures. Karma literally means deed or action; what is sometimes called the law of karma refers to an underlying law of cause and effect that is seen to permeate all existence. The idea is that every action leads to a reasonable result  and, consequently, that everything that happens can be traced to something done in the past. Actions determine destiny: this is the basic idea of karma. If anything happens to us that is truly good, we must have done something in the past to deserve it; if something ill befalls us, then at some time in the past we did something that was not so meritorious. This is a basic moral law that all great spiritual traditions share: the belief that we reap what we sow. The Hindu tradition gave a great deal of thought to this problem of moral cause and effect, and generation after generation of spiritual teachers fathomed its depths and implications. One fear that developed over time was that all action was in a sense an open door to bondage: anything a  \fperson did would bind him to the endless cycle of cause and effect. Some fruits of action would of course be pleasant  not all karma is painful. But even this pleasure could be a trap, because we would seek it compulsively, tying ourselves tighter and tighter to the responsibilities and opportunities of the worldly life and forgetting our spiritual dimension altogether. In chapter 3 Krishna begins to tell Arjuna the way out of this maze of cause and effect. It is not to avoid work, especially the duties required by his station in life, but to perform those duties without selfish attachment to their fruit, or outcome. If Arjuna follows this path of selfless work, Krishna explains, he will enjoy this world as well as the next. More important, he will gain a spiritual blessing and will be lessening his debt of karma. Only when he is free from every bond of karma  every consequence of past action  can he achieve lifes ultimate goal. The world is bound in its own activity, for all creatures except the illumined man or woman work for their own pleasure and gain. Because they act selfishly, they are bound by the results, whether good or bad. We must act in a selfless spirit, Krishna says, without ego-involvement and without getting entangled in whether things work out the way we want; only then will we not fall into the terrible net of karma. We cannot hope to escape karma by refraining from our duties: even to survive in the world, we must act. True, the Hindu scriptures do hold out another path  jnana yoga, the path of wisdom  which does not enjoin action. But Krishna does not really offer this to Arjuna as an alternative; it is acknowledged and then dropped. Perhaps Krishna knows that Arjuna is not the type to disengage himself and go off on a search for the mystical vision. For Arjuna, the active life is essential. The danger, of course, of a life of active engagement in the world is that Arjuna will get caught up in his actions and begin to act out of selfish motives. If this were to happen, he would be doomed to spiritual failure. Having a good deal of self-knowledge, Arjuna senses this danger. He asks Krishna a fundamental question: What power binds us to our selfish ways? Even if we wish to act rightly, so often we do the wrong thing. What power moves us? Krishna replies that anger and selfish desire are our greatest enemies. They are the destructive powers that can compel us to wander away from our purpose, to end up in self-delusion and despair.  \fHere it is necessary to introduce two technical terms from Hindu philosophy. The Gita is not an academic work of philosophy, but a poetic, practical text. Still, it does refer from time to time to Sankhya, one of the six traditional schools of Indian philosophy. In Sankhya, the phenomenal world of mind and matter is described as having three basic qualities or gunas: sattva goodness, light, purity; rajas passion, activity, energy; and tamas darkness, ignorance, inertia. According to Sankhya, spiritual evolution progresses from tamas to rajas to sattva, and final liberation takes the soul beyond the three gunas altogether. Here Krishna warns Arjuna to beware the pitfalls of rajas, for it is from rajas that anger and selfish desire arise. Arjuna must realize that his true nature, the Atman, is above entanglement in the gunas. The gunas act and react upon one another, but Arjunas inner being is not affected. If he cannot reach this detachment, he will be always caught in the emotional storms of passion (rajas) or the quagmires of inertia (tamas) which alternate in dominating the mind and body. Krishna offers Arjuna the example of King Janaka, well known from holy legend, as a model for the princely estate. Janaka was a king who ruled well and did not shirk his responsibilities, yet he was detached and worked from a sense of duty, not for personal gain or enjoyment. He was revered as a royal sage who pursued his enlightenment not by renouncing the world, but by working in it and contributing to its welfare, thus enjoying the best of both worlds.   \f3: Selfless Service ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have said that knowledge is greater than action; why then do you ask me to wage this terrible war? 2 Your advice seems inconsistent. Give me one path to follow to the supreme good. 1  KRISHNA  At the beginning of time I declared two paths for the pure heart: jnana yoga, the contemplative path of spiritual wisdom, and karma yoga, the active path of selfless service. 3  One who shirks action does not attain freedom; no one can gain perfection by abstaining from work. 5 Indeed, there is no one who rests for even an instant; all creatures are driven to action by their own nature. 4  Those who abstain from action while allowing the mind to dwell on sensual pleasure cannot be called sincere spiritual aspirants. 7 But they excel who control their senses through the mind, using them for selfless service. 6  Fulfill all your duties; action is better than inaction. Even to maintain your body, Arjuna, you are obliged to act. 9 Selfish action imprisons the world. Act selflessly, without any thought of personal profit. 8  At the beginning, mankind and the obligation of selfless service were created together. Through selfless service, you will always be 10  \ffruitful and find the fulfillment of your desires: this is the promise of the Creator. Honor and cherish the devas as they honor and cherish you; through this honor and love you will attain the supreme good. 12 All human desires are fulfilled by the devas, who are pleased by selfless service. But anyone who enjoys the things given by the devas without offering selfless acts in return is a thief. 11  The spiritually minded, who eat in the spirit of service, are freed from all their sins; but the selfish, who prepare food for their own satisfaction, eat sin. 14 Living creatures are nourished by food, and food is nourished by rain; rain itself is the water of life, which comes from selfless worship and service. 13  Every selfless act, Arjuna, is born from Brahman, the eternal, infinite Godhead. Brahman is present in every act of service. 16 All life turns on this law, O Arjuna. Those who violate it, indulging the senses for their own pleasure and ignoring the needs of others, have wasted their life. 17 But those who realize the Self are always satisfied. Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no longer seek happiness from the external world. 18 They have nothing to gain or lose by any action; neither people nor things can affect their security. 15  Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. 20 Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path. 19  What the outstanding person does, others will try to do. The standards such people create will be followed by the whole world. 22 There is nothing in the three worlds for me to gain, Arjuna, nor is there anything I do not have; I continue to act, but I am not driven by any need of my own. 23 If I ever refrained from continuous work, everyone would immediately follow my example. 24 If I stopped working I would be the cause of cosmic chaos, and finally of the destruction of this world and these people. 21  \fThe ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare of the world, without thought for themselves. 26 By abstaining from work you will confuse the ignorant, who are engrossed in their actions. Perform all work carefully, guided by compassion. 25  All actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti. Deluded by identification with the ego, a person thinks, I am the doer. 28 But the illumined man or woman understands the domain of the gunas and is not attached. Such people know that the gunas interact with each other; they do not claim to be the doer. 27  Those who are deluded by the operation of the gunas become attached to the results of their action. Those who understand these truths should not unsettle the ignorant. 30 Performing all actions for my sake, completely absorbed in the Self, and without expectations, fight!  but stay free from the fever of the ego. 29  Those who live in accordance with these divine laws without complaining, firmly established in faith, are released from karma. 32 Those who violate these laws, criticizing and complaining, are utterly deluded, and are the cause of their own suffering. 31  Even the wise act within the limitations of their own nature. Every creature is subject to prakriti; what is the use of repression? 34 The senses have been conditioned by attraction to the pleasant and aversion to the unpleasant. Do not be ruled by them; they are obstacles in your path. 33  It is better to strive in ones own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following ones own dharma, but competition in anothers dharma breeds fear and insecurity. 35  ARJUNA  What is the force that binds us to selfish deeds, O Krishna? What power moves us, even against our will, as if forcing us? 36  \fKRISHNA  It is selfish desire and anger, arising from the guna of rajas; these are the appetites and evils which threaten a person in this life. 37  Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, just as the embryo rests deep within the womb, knowledge is hidden by selfish desire  39 hidden, Arjuna, by this unquenchable fire for self-satisfaction, the inveterate enemy of the wise. 38  Selfish desire is found in the senses, mind, and intellect, misleading them and burying the understanding in delusion. 41 Fight with all your strength, Arjuna! Controlling your senses, conquer your enemy, the destroyer of knowledge and realization. 40  The senses are higher than the body, the mind higher than the senses; above the mind is the intellect, and above the intellect is the Atman. 43 Thus, knowing that which is supreme, let the Atman rule the ego. Use your mighty arms to slay the fierce enemy that is selfish desire. 42  \fChapter_four  Wisdom in Action Krishna is eager to grant Arjuna knowledge of the highest spiritual truths, or even a rare mystical vision; but Arjuna has been asking for Krishna to simply get him out of his present difficulties. Of course these difficulties are not minor  he is caught in a family tragedy that has developed into a vicious conflict. If he cannot extricate himself, he knows that he will have to take part in a catastrophic battle that no one wants. So when Krishna begins to tell Arjuna about the secret teachings he will be privileged to hear because he is Krishnas favorite devotee and friend, it hardly registers in Arjunas consciousness. His reply is confused. How could you have taught any secret wisdom to the sages of old? he asks. At this point Krishna reminds Arjuna again of the process of rebirth. They have both been reborn many times, but naturally Arjuna does not remember his past lives because he has no access to this kind of knowledge. Krishna remembers his former births, but he is no ordinary being. He reveals that he has chosen to take on human birth many times for the welfare of the world. Whenever dharma, the law of lifes unity, declines, he wraps himself in his maya and takes on a finite form. Thus he returns age after age. Vishnu, the preserving or sustaining person of the Hindu Trinity, is not mentioned here, but Krishna is usually looked upon as an incarnation of this aspect of God. As the Lord, Krishna explains, he dwells in every being, but he is manifested with special power in his incarnations or avatars. Avatara literally means descent: Vishnu is believed to descend and incarnate himself on earth from age to age to reestablish divine law (dharma). Without such intervention the entire created universe would go into decline. The natural course of creation is to go through cycles of regeneration and decay, but Vishnu  Krishna  has compassion for all the suffering of the world, and comes himself to protect the good and destroy evil. Thus Vishnu has a special relationship with all beings: he personifies the aspect of God who so loves the world that he comes into it to reestablish the purity and happiness of the Golden Age.  \fKrishna here reveals a little of his hidden, divine nature. He tells Arjuna that mystical union with him is possible through devotion, by which one can enter the state of divine love in which one sees God in every creature. Krishna also takes on the role of creator. It is he who has patterned the world along the lines of guna and karma. This mystic aspect of Krishnas being dominates the Gita. In the Mahabharata, Krishna is a princely ally who is wise and daring in his support of his friend Arjuna. But the author of the Gita is not concerned with this Krishna; he turns his attention to the mystery of Krishnas divine nature as an aspect of Vishnu. In this sense Krishna is the inner Self in all beings. His name comes from the Sanskrit root krish, to draw to oneself, to attract. He is the attractive one, the Lord of loving attraction. By another etymology, the word Krishna means the dark one. The author of the Gita sees revealed in him the ultimate Godhead, the supreme being. But this reality is often veiled, and then Krishna is seen as an ordinary human being  or, rather, as an exceptionally gifted man, but not as God. Many of Krishnas words make most sense when we realize that when he speaks of himself, he is often not describing a transcendental reality so much as trying to tell Arjuna about the Self in every human being. When he says, for example, Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results, he means, Arjuna, actions do not cling to your real Self. The Self in us is not touched by action; whatever we do, it remains unsullied. Those who understand this  about themselves  and practice it live in freedom. The latter part of this chapter turns from lofty mystical topics back to Arjunas immediate problem. Krishna begins to talk about action, and work, and things that should be done and should not be done. It is essential, he reminds Arjuna, to act wisely, with detachment. The wise never act with selfish attachment to the fruit of their labor; they give their best in fortune and misfortune alike. Such people act in freedom. The next section deals with the various kinds of yajna  worship or offering  that may be performed by spiritual aspirants of differing temperaments. Hindu rituals often involve making an offering to the gods by pouring an oblation into the sacred fire. Here the image is the same: whatever is offered is symbolically thrown into a consuming fire that carries the offering to God. The offering may be as obvious as worldly goods, or as subtle as knowledge or meditation: in any case it requires a  \fmeasure of self-sacrifice. Yajna is a basic action, necessary to life, and those who do not perform some kind of selfless service find no home in this world or the next. The final verses of chapter 4 introduce a new principle. In the last chapter, Krishna mentioned the path of spiritual wisdom as an alternative to the path of action or karma yoga. Now he reveals that wisdom is the goal of selfless action: knowing is the fruit of doing. The goal of all karma yoga or yajna is liberation and spiritual wisdom. The fire of spiritual awareness burns to ashes even a great heap of karma; thus true knowledge is the greatest purifier of the soul. Krishna ends by exhorting Arjuna to cut through the doubts that still stifle him. This is the first  but not the last  mention that Krishna makes of Arjunas doubting heart. There has been no indication so far that Arjuna has taken in and accepted Krishnas words. But even though Arjuna continues to drag his feet, Krishna does not abandon him.   \f4: Wisdom in Action KRISHNA  I told this eternal secret to Vivasvat. Vivasvat taught Manu, and Manu taught Ikshvaku. 2 Thus, Arjuna, eminent sages received knowledge of yoga in a continuous tradition. But through time the practice of yoga was lost in the world. 1  The secret of these teachings is profound. I have explained them to you today because you are my friend and devotee. 3  ARJUNA  You were born much after Vivasvat; he lived very long ago. Why do you say that you taught this yoga in the beginning? 4  KRISHNA  You and I have passed through many births, Arjuna. You have forgotten, but I remember them all. 5  My true being is unborn and changeless. I am the Lord who dwells in every creature. Through the power of my own maya, I manifest myself in a finite form. 6  Whenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I manifest myself on earth. 8 I am born in every age to protect the good, to destroy evil, and to reestablish dharma. 7  Those who know me as their own divine Self break through the belief that they are the body and are not reborn as separate creatures. Such a one, Arjuna, is united with me. 10 Delivered from selfish 9  \fattachment, fear, and anger, filled with me, surrendering themselves to me, purified in the fire of my being, many have reached the state of unity in me. As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. 11  Those desiring success in their actions worship the gods; through action in the world of mortals, their desires are quickly fulfilled. 13 The distinctions of caste, guna, and karma have come from me. I am their cause, but I myself am changeless and beyond all action. 14 Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results. Those who understand this and practice it live in freedom. 15 Knowing this truth, aspirants desiring liberation in ancient times engaged in action. You too can do the same, pursuing an active life in the manner of those ancient sages. 12  What is action and what is inaction? This question has confused the greatest sages. I will give you the secret of action, with which you can free yourself from bondage. 17 The true nature of action is difficult to grasp. You must understand what is action and what is inaction, and what kind of action should be avoided. 16  The wise see that there is action in the midst of inaction and inaction in the midst of action. Their consciousness is unified, and every act is done with complete awareness. 18  The awakened sages call a person wise when all his undertakings are free from anxiety about results; all his selfish desires have been consumed in the fire of knowledge. 20 The wise, ever satisfied, have abandoned all external supports. Their security is unaffected by the results of their action; even while acting, they really do nothing at all. 21 Free from expectations and from all sense of possession, with mind and body firmly controlled by the Self, they do not incur sin by the performance of physical action. 19  They live in freedom who have gone beyond the dualities of life. Competing with no one, they are alike in success and failure and 22  \fcontent with whatever comes to them. 23 They are free, without selfish attachments; their minds are fixed in knowledge. They perform all work in the spirit of service, and their karma is dissolved. The process of offering is Brahman; that which is offered is Brahman. Brahman offers the sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. Brahman is attained by those who see Brahman in every action. 24  Some aspirants offer material sacrifices to the gods. Others offer selfless service as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. 26 Some renounce all enjoyment of the senses, sacrificing them in the fire of sense restraint. Others partake of sense objects but offer them in service through the fire of the senses. 27 Some offer the workings of the senses and the vital forces through the fire of self-control, kindled in the path of knowledge. 25  Some offer wealth; others offer sense restraint and suffering. Some take vows and offer knowledge and study of the scriptures; and some make the offering of meditation. 29 Some offer the forces of vitality, regulating their inhalation and exhalation, and thus gain control over these forces. 30 Others offer the forces of vitality through restraint of their senses. All these understand the meaning of service and will be cleansed of their impurities. 28  True sustenance is in service, and through it a man or woman reaches the eternal Brahman. But those who do not seek to serve are without a home in this world. Arjuna, how can they be at home in any world to come? 31  These offerings are born of work, and each guides mankind along a path to Brahman. Understanding this, you will attain liberation. 33 The offering of wisdom is better than any material offering, Arjuna; for the goal of all work is spiritual wisdom. 32  Approach those who have realized the purpose of life and question them with reverence and devotion; they will instruct you in 34  \fthis wisdom. 35 Once you attain it, you will never again be deluded. You will see all creatures in the Self, and all in me. Even if you were the most sinful of sinners, Arjuna, you could cross beyond all sin by the raft of spiritual wisdom. 37 As the heat of a fire reduces wood to ashes, the fire of knowledge burns to ashes all karma. 38 Nothing in this world purifies like spiritual wisdom. It is the perfection achieved in time through the path of yoga, the path which leads to the Self within. 36  Those who take wisdom as their highest goal, whose faith is deep and whose senses are trained, attain wisdom quickly and enter into perfect peace. 40 But the ignorant, indecisive and lacking in faith, waste their lives. They can never be happy in this world or any other. 39  Those established in the Self have renounced selfish attachments to their actions and cut through doubts with spiritual wisdom. They act in freedom. 42 Arjuna, cut through this doubt in your own heart with the sword of spiritual wisdom. Arise; take up the path of yoga! 41  \fChapter_five  Renounce & Rejoice At the beginning of this chapter, the traditional approach to the spiritual life  that is, leaving the world, retiring from the ordinary affairs of job and family  is contrasted with working in the world with detachment. The general term for retiring from the world is sannyasa, renunciation. Traditionally, sannyasa meant renouncing all worldly ties and attachments. The person undertaking the vow of sannyasa would leave home, family, and occupation to pursue a strict contemplative life. This was a path chosen by very few, even in ancient India. Yet we shouldnt forget that surprising numbers of people in traditional societies, both in the East and the West, have chosen a monastic life removed from the turmoil of the world. In India, the Compassionate Buddha provides the classic example of one who leaves the comforts and fulfillments of family and worldly life to seek the lonely way to Self-realization. The story is well known throughout Asia. Siddhartha Gautama was a prince with every worldly satisfaction within his reach, who left his palace to find a way to lead the world beyond suffering and death. He became a wandering sannyasi, a lonely, austere monk. Only after he had attained to complete enlightenment did he return to society, to teach others of the peace of nirvana. Though Krishna acknowledges here that this way of sannyasa can lead to the goal, he recommends the path of selfless action or selfless service as the better way. He contrasts the way of Sankhya  which in this context means knowledge of the Self in a general way  to the way of yoga, which here means the way of action. This term yoga presents difficulties in the Gita because it means different things at different times, and many definitions are given of this all-purpose term. But for several chapters the topic under discussion has been the active spiritual life, or karma yoga, and that is clearly what is meant in this context. Sankhya and yoga might also be translated as theory and practice. It would seem that at the time of the Gita the path of wisdom was regarded very highly, while the path of action may have been looked upon as an adulteration of the spiritual life. It is even possible that the Gita was  \fthe first Hindu scripture to introduce the novel idea of combining karma yoga with the pursuit of Self-knowledge. Krishna says that only immature, inexperienced people look upon the paths of knowledge and action as different. The true goal of action is knowledge of the Self. Following either path faithfully will lead to the complete spiritual vision. It is essential in karma yoga that the selfish ego not expect gratification from the work. When there is no selfish involvement in work, the worker does not come to spiritual harm. The example is the lotus: it spends its life floating in water, yet the drops of water roll off its leaves without ever wetting them. Similarly, as long as the karma yogis do not expect reward or recognition, any evil that might stain them has nowhere to cling. Such yogis are said to be detached from the outcome or fruits of their actions (karma phala). Krishna warns Arjuna that a life of work, even successful work, cannot be fulfilling without Self-knowledge. Ultimately, the true Self within him is not affected by what he does, whether good or bad. Only knowledge of the Self, which rises like the sun at dawn, can fulfill the purpose of his life and lead him beyond rebirth. This knowledge of the Self or Atman is, by its very nature, also knowledge of Brahman, the all-pervading, immanent and transcendent Godhead. Krishna says that the illumined person sees this divine essence in all beings. He or she has equal vision and sees the divine Self in all, regardless of the outer aspect. The last three verses of the chapter describe a state of profound meditation called samadhi. When meditation becomes very deep, breathing becomes slow, steady, and even, and the windows of the senses close to all outward sensations. Next the faculties of the mind quiet down, resting from their usually frantic activity; even the primal emotions of desire, fear, and anger subside. When all these sensory and emotional tides have ceased to flow, then the spirit is free, mukta  at least for the time being. It has entered the state called samadhi. Samadhi can come and go; generally it can be entered only in a long period of meditation and after many years of ardent endeavor. But one verse (5:28) adds the significant word sada, always. Once this state of deep concentration becomes established, the person lives in spiritual freedom, or moksha, permanently. This is extremely rare. Mystics of the West as well as the East have attained brief glimpses of unity, but very few can be said to  \fhave dwelt in it permanently, as if it were their natural habitat. In the West the most prominent figures are Meister Eckhart, St. Teresa of Avila, and St. John of the Cross, though there have been others. In the Hindu tradition there is a long line of saints and mystics who have tried to communicate something of the nature of this union with Reality or God, from the unknown recorders of the Upanishads through the Buddha, Shankara, and Meera, to Ramakrishna and Ramana Maharshi.   \f5: Renounce & Rejoice ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have recommended both the path of selfless action and sannyasa, the path of renunciation of action. Tell me definitely which is better. 1  KRISHNA  Both renunciation of action and the selfless performance of action lead to the supreme goal. But the path of action is better than renunciation. 2  Those who have attained perfect renunciation are free from any sense of duality; they are unaffected by likes and dislikes, Arjuna, and are free from the bondage of self-will. 4 The immature think that knowledge and action are different, but the wise see them as the same. The person who is established in one path will attain the rewards of both. 5 The goal of knowledge and the goal of service are the same; those who fail to see this are blind. 3  Perfect renunciation is difficult to attain without performing action. But the wise, following the path of selfless service, quickly reach Brahman. 6  Those who follow the path of service, who have completely purified themselves and conquered their senses and self-will, see the Self in all creatures and are untouched by any action they perform. 7  Those who know this truth, whose consciousness is unified, think always, I am not the doer. While seeing or hearing, touching or 8  \fsmelling; eating, moving about, or sleeping; breathing 9 or speaking, letting go or holding on, even opening or closing the eyes, they understand that these are only the movements of the senses among sense objects. Those who surrender to Brahman all selfish attachments are like the leaf of a lotus floating clean and dry in water. Sin cannot touch them. 11 Renouncing their selfish attachments, those who follow the path of service work with body, senses, and mind for the sake of self-purification. 10  Those whose consciousness is unified abandon all attachment to the results of action and attain supreme peace. But those whose desires are fragmented, who are selfishly attached to the results of their work, are bound in everything they do. 12  Those who renounce attachment in all their deeds live content in the city of nine gates, the body, as its master. They are not driven to act, nor do they involve others in action. 13  Neither the sense of acting, nor actions, nor the connection of cause and effect comes from the Lord of this world. These three arise from nature. 14  The Lord does not partake in the good and evil deeds of any person; judgment is clouded when wisdom is obscured by ignorance. 16 But ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self within. The light of this knowledge shines like the sun, revealing the supreme Brahman. 17 Those who cast off sin through this knowledge, absorbed in the Lord and established in him as their one goal and refuge, are not reborn as separate creatures. 15  Those who possess this wisdom have equal regard for all. They see the same Self in a spiritual aspirant and an outcaste, in an elephant, a cow, and a dog. 19 Such people have mastered life. With even mind they rest in Brahman, who is perfect and is everywhere the same. 20 They are not elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. With mind established in Brahman, they are free from delusion. 18  \fNot dependent on any external support, they realize the joy of spiritual awareness. With consciousness unified through meditation, they live in abiding joy. 21  Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses have a beginning and an end and give birth to misery, Arjuna. The wise do not look for happiness in them. 23 But those who overcome the impulses of lust and anger which arise in the body are made whole and live in joy. 24 They find their joy, their rest, and their light completely within themselves. United with the Lord, they attain nirvana in Brahman. 22  Healed of their sins and conflicts, working for the good of all beings, the holy sages attain nirvana in Brahman. 26 Free from anger and selfish desire, unified in mind, those who follow the path of yoga and realize the Self are established forever in that supreme state. 25  Closing their eyes, steadying their breathing, and focusing their attention on the center of spiritual consciousness, 28 the wise master their senses, mind, and intellect through meditation. Self-realization is their only goal. Freed from selfish desire, fear, and anger, they live in freedom always. 29 Knowing me as the friend of all creatures, the Lord of the universe, the end of all offerings and all spiritual disciplines, they attain eternal peace. 27  \fChapter_six  The Practice of Meditation This is surely one of the most intriguing chapters of the Gita, for here we are given a detailed explanation of meditation addressed to the layperson. The same meditation techniques are given in more esoteric writings, such as the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, but the Gita does it more simply, without any unnecessary mystery or complexity. This chapter also explores the question, Who is the true yogi? This word yogi, if it has any associations for the Western reader, is likely to bring up images of rather far-out types who do strange contortions with their bodies. Yogis are still thought of as standing on their heads or reclining on a bed of nails. It is true that there are many practitioners of a kind of yoga that involves physical exercises and postures; and there are those who have achieved remarkable feats like lying on beds of nails, or even being buried alive and surviving. But this physical side of yoga (called hatha yoga, the yoga of force) is not what is meant in the Gita. In fact, though physical techniques have a place, the Gita regards undue emphasis on them as extreme, not belonging to the normal course of spiritual development. In the Gita, the word yogi often has a more modest definition: it can mean a person who does his or her job with detachment from the rewards (6:1), or it can be rendered as one who has attained the goal of meditation. For yogi literally means one who is accomplished in yoga, and yoga means integration of the spirit. In this sense, yoga means wholeness or the process of becoming whole at the deepest spiritual level. The word yoga is also often used as a synonym for raja yoga, the practice of meditation as taught by Patanjali; for meditation is the direct means of becoming integrated, united with ones truest, deepest Self. Thus a yogi, among other things, is a person who is an adept at meditation. Until now, Krishna has been instructing Arjuna in the need for karma yoga, the active life of service. Now he is ready to initiate his disciple into the practice of the more interior disciplines of the spiritual life. Karma yoga, he says, is the path for those who wish to climb the mountain of Selfrealization; for those who have reached the summit, the path is shama, the peace of contemplation. At the beginning of the spiritual life, great exertion  \fis required; as the summit is approached, though the climb gets no easier, the dimension of contemplation or stillness is added. Many spiritual traditions, of course, use this image when speaking of the religious quest. The mountaintop is the place where the holy, like Moses, commune with God; and St. John of the Cross describes the path to union with God as climbing the mountain of Carmel. In climbing this mountain, willpower, self-help, intense personal effort, are absolute essentials. The literal translation of verse 5 is one should lift oneself up by ones Self  a play on the word atman, which can mean the highest Self as well as self in the ordinary sense. Ones self is thus ones friend or ones own enemy. The lower self, as Western mystics sometimes call it, is self-will  will in the negative, selfish sense. An unruly will twisted toward self-aggrandizement is an enemy lurking right inside the fort, where it can do the most damage. But those who have conquered themselves by themselves have their truest friend in the Self. Only those who have genuine self-discipline, who are self-conquered, live in peace. These, Krishna says, are true yogis. They cannot harbor any malice, cannot even bring themselves to look upon anyone as an enemy. They are samabuddhi, of equable mind. The true yogi, the person who is truly integrated inside, looks upon and feels everyone elses joy and sorrow just as if it were his own. He sees the Self in all beings, everywhere. How is this self-conquest to be made? Very simply, the Gita teaches that the mind must be made one-pointed through the practice of meditation. This is the basic technique. In the Gita we do not see the tendency for elaboration, for ritual and mystery, that we sometimes find in the Hindu tradition. Krishna simply tells Arjuna, first, that he must find an appropriate place to meditate. A suitable spot for his practice will be clean and comfortable. In a nod to tradition, one verse recommends the meditation seat be covered with kusha grass and a deer skin  the traditional seat of the yogi. The important thing, however, is not how the meditation cushion is constructed, but what is going on in the mind. Meditation is an internal discipline to make the mind one-pointed, absolutely concentrated. Second, Krishna offers a bit of advice about holding the body, head, and neck in a straight line. This may seem esoteric  a reference to the contortion-school of yoga  but actually it has a practical purpose. Sitting absolutely straight, with the spinal column erect, prevents drowsiness. Also,  \fin advanced stages of meditation, it allows for the free flow of vital energy or kundalini (see Glossary). Then practical advice is given: moderation is the path. Neither extreme asceticism nor indulgence will aid meditation. A superficial acquaintance with Hindu culture may leave the impression that it fosters either the sensuality of the Kama Sutra or the asceticism of the hermit. It is true that in Indian civilization we can easily see the ultimate development of the sensual and beautiful life in its finest manifestation, in painting, sculpture, music, and dance. And Indian cuisine is famous for its incredible variety of flavors and spices. India also presents us with the austere simplicity of the wandering holy man or sadhu. The Gita, however, recommends the middle path. Success in meditation, Krishna says, comes neither to those who eat or sleep too much nor to those who eat or sleep too little. The body should be neither overindulged nor treated harshly  the same recommendation the Buddha was to offer later, after many years of severe asceticism. This chapter contains the famous verse (6:19) comparing the mind to a steady flame. By its very nature the untrained mind is restless, constantly wandering here and there in trying to fulfil its desires. It flickers wildly like a flame in a storm  never blown completely out, yet at the mercy of the wind. Wherever it wanders, Krishna says, it must be brought back to its source; it must learn to rest in the Self. Once it is at home in the depths of contemplation, the mind becomes steady, like an upright, unflickering flame in a windless place. In this deep meditation, and only there, can the human being find true fulfillment. Then the still mind touches Brahman and enjoys bliss. Now Arjuna asks the inevitable question. Krishna is way ahead of him, and the struggling disciple calls out, Wait a minute! or words to that effect. He says, My mind is so restless and unsteady that I cannot even comprehend anything about this state of mystic peace you are talking about. The mind is so powerful, so turbulent, that trying to bring it under control is like trying to catch the wind. Krishna admits that the mind is terribly hard to train, but he maintains that it can be done through regular practice if one has detachment. It is interesting that he does not offer to help Arjuna here; that will come later. For now, he tells Arjuna that he must do it for himself, through hard work and detachment from private, personal motives.  \fThen Arjuna asks a rather surprising question: what happens to the person who believes in a spiritual goal but does not pursue it to the end? What if one of his more powerful compulsive desires gets the better of him, scattering his resolution the way a cloud is scattered by the wind? Arjuna must be at least partly convinced that there is something to all this, but either he is not ready to begin meditating or he is afraid that somehow he might fail if he tried. If he were to fail, he asks, would he have lost everything  all that he had given up in worldly life as well as his goal of self-fulfillment? Affectionately, Krishna assures Arjuna that no attempt to improve his spiritual condition could possibly be a wasted effort. Even looking ahead to the next life, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain. He will be reborn in a household suitable for taking up his quest where he left off. In his next life, he will feel drawn to the spiritual goal once again, and he will have a head start. The general Hindu belief is that Self-realization requires many, many lives of spiritual discipline.   \f6: Practice of Meditation KRISHNA  It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those who work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of meditation. Theirs is true renunciation. 2 Therefore, Arjuna, you should understand that renunciation and the performance of selfless service are the same. Those who cannot renounce attachment to the results of their work are far from the path. 1  For aspirants who want to climb the mountain of spiritual awareness, the path is selfless work; for those who have ascended to yoga the path is stillness and peace. 4 When a person has freed himself from attachment to the results of work, and from desires for the enjoyment of sense objects, he ascends to the unitive state. 3  Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. 5  To those who have conquered themselves, the will is a friend. But it is the enemy of those who have not found the Self within them. 6  The supreme Reality stands revealed in the consciousness of those who have conquered themselves. They live in peace, alike in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. 7  They are completely fulfilled by spiritual wisdom and Selfrealization. Having conquered their senses, they have climbed to the summit of human consciousness. To such people a clod of dirt, a stone, and gold are the same. 9 They are equally disposed to family, 8  \fenemies, and friends, to those who support them and those who are hostile, to the good and the evil alike. Because they are impartial, they rise to great heights. Those who aspire to the state of yoga should seek the Self in inner solitude through meditation. With body and mind controlled they should constantly practice one-pointedness, free from expectations and attachment to material possessions. 10  Select a clean spot, neither too high nor too low, and seat yourself firmly on a cloth, a deerskin, and kusha grass. 12 Then, once seated, strive to still your thoughts. Make your mind one-pointed in meditation, and your heart will be purified. 13 Hold your body, head, and neck firmly in a straight line, and keep your eyes from wandering. 14 With all fears dissolved in the peace of the Self and all desires dedicated to Brahman, controlling the mind and fixing it on me, sit in meditation with me as your only goal. 15 With senses and mind constantly controlled through meditation, united with the Self within, an aspirant attains nirvana, the state of abiding joy and peace in me. 11  Arjuna, those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too much or sleep too little, will not succeed in meditation. 17 But those who are temperate in eating and sleeping, work and recreation, will come to the end of sorrow through meditation. 18 Through constant effort they learn to withdraw the mind from selfish cravings and absorb it in the Self. Thus they attain the state of union. 16  When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp in a windless place. 20 In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. 21 Having attained that abiding joy beyond the senses, revealed in the stilled mind, he never swerves from the eternal truth. 22 He desires nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow. 19  \fThe practice of meditation frees one from all affliction. This is the path of yoga. Follow it with determination and sustained enthusiasm. 24 Renouncing wholeheartedly all selfish desires and expectations, use your will to control the senses. 25 Little by little, through patience and repeated effort, the mind will become stilled in the Self. 23  Wherever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for satisfaction without, lead it within; train it to rest in the Self 27 Abiding joy comes to those who still the mind. Freeing themselves from the taint of self-will, with their consciousness unified, they become one with Brahman. 26  The infinite joy of touching Brahman is easily attained by those who are free from the burden of evil and established within themselves. 29 They see the Self in every creature and all creation in the Self. With consciousness unified through meditation, they see everything with an equal eye. 28  I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me. 31 They worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. 30  When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. 32  ARJUNA  O Krishna, the stillness of divine union which you describe is beyond my comprehension. How can the mind, which is so restless, attain lasting peace? 34 Krishna, the mind is restless, turbulent, powerful, violent; trying to control it is like trying to tame the wind. 33  KRISHNA  \fIt is true that the mind is restless and difficult to control. But it can be conquered, Arjuna, through regular practice and detachment. 36 Those who lack self-control will find it difficult to progress in meditation; but those who are self-controlled, striving earnestly through the right means, will attain the goal. 35  ARJUNA  Krishna, what happens to the man who has faith but who lacks self-control and wanders from the path, not attaining success in yoga? 38 If a man becomes deluded on the spiritual path, will he lose the support of both worlds, like a cloud scattered in the sky? 39 Krishna, you can dispel all doubts; remove this doubt which binds me. 37  KRISHNA  Arjuna, my son, such a person will not be destroyed. No one who does good work will ever come to a bad end, either here or in the world to come. 40  When such people die, they go to other realms where the righteous live. They dwell there for countless years and then are reborn into a home which is pure and prosperous. 42 Or they may be born into a family where meditation is practiced; to be born into such a family is extremely rare. 43 The wisdom they have acquired in previous lives will be reawakened, Arjuna, and they will strive even harder for Self-realization. 44 Indeed, they will be driven on by the strength of their past disciplines. Even one who inquires after the practice of meditation rises above those who simply perform rituals. 41  Through constant effort over many lifetimes, a person becomes purified of all selfish desires and attains the supreme goal of life. 45  Meditation is superior to severe asceticism and the path of knowledge. It is also superior to selfless service. May you attain the goal of meditation, Arjuna! 47 Even among those who meditate, that 46  \fman or woman who worships me with perfect faith, completely absorbed in me, is the most firmly established in yoga.  \fChapter_seven  Wisdom from Realization In Sanskrit this chapter is called The Yoga of Wisdom and Realization  or The Yoga of Wisdom from Realization. The term used for wisdom is jnana; for realization, vijnana. There is room for confusion in this terminology, as jnana and vijnana are open to differing interpretations. Both words are from the root jna, to know, which is related to the Greek word gnosis. The prefix vi added to a noun usually intensifies its meaning; so vijnana could mean to know intensely or to a greater degree. In this context, however, jnana is the standard term for the highest kind of knowledge: not scholarship or book-learning but direct knowledge of God, spiritual wisdom. If we take jnana in this sense, we are not left with an obvious meaning for vijnana, a more intense kind of jnana. Ramakrishna takes vijnana to mean an intimate, practical familiarity with God, the ability to carry through in daily affairs with the more abstract understanding that is jnana. Ramakrishna says, One who has merely heard of fire has ajnana, ignorance. One who has seen fire has jnana. But one who has actually built a fire and cooked on it has vijnana. In this chapter we find ourselves following several trails and sometimes lose the unifying theme, which is knowledge of the supreme reality underlying nature. Eventually, however, we come back to the starting point: knowledge contrasted with ignorance, transcendent reality as opposed to the phenomenal world. But to pursue the byways. First, Krishnas two natures are discussed. On the one hand, he has created out of himself the elements and all things that make up the phenomenal world. Beyond this is Krishnas spiritual nature as the transcendent Lord of the universe. Here the Gita is referring to a concept that later became a basis of the Sankhya school of Hindu philosophy. Sankhya recognized two fundamental principles underlying all things: prakriti, the principle of mind and matter, and Purusha, the principle of pure spirit. The union of these two eternal, fundamental forces sets in motion the creation of the world as we know it. Their union also shapes and defines all ordinary human experience. In Sankhya, the goal of Self-  \frealization is seen as the final freeing of the spirit (Purusha) from its flirtation with mind and matter (prakriti). Unlike Sankhya, however, in the Gita it is Krishna who is behind both prakriti and Purusha. In this chapter, Krishna is presented as the Creator of the world. His divine nature can be glimpsed in his bewildering and wonderful creation. In much Hindu mythology, it is the god Brahma who takes credit for creating the world. It is he, the four-faced deity, who has flung forth the manifold worlds of this and former (as well as future) universes. But in the mythology of Vishnu, Brahma is born in the lotus that grows from Vishnus navel. The lotus is Vishnus womb. In it Brahma is born, and at Vishnus urging he creates the worlds. Vishnu is the real Creator; Brahma is a demigod born of Vishnus will to create. Here in the Gita Krishna directly assumes all the roles and honors usually shared with the other aspects of God worshipped in the Hindu faith. It is not that these other divine personifications are rejected, but simply that all attention is on Krishna. For the author of the Gita, Krishna is the form of God to be worshipped, and for the time being all other forms of God disappear. Krishna alone is. In fact, one verse states that whatever other god one seems to worship, one is in reality approaching Krishna himself. Worshipping him, knowing him, enables the devotee to attain the goal. Though the word is not used in the Gita, the idea of the world as Krishnas lila, his play, became a cherished theme of later Hinduism. Krishna, it is said, created the world in play: just as a child might desire to have companions to play with, Krishna desired companions, and made the world. Krishna participates in the game of life; his divine qualities shine through in the world wherever there is excellence of any kind. He is, he tells Arjuna, the essence of every created thing: the sapidity of water, the brightness of fire, the effort of the spiritual aspirant. This may be what is meant by the vijnana of our title  the mystics vision of the divine as present here and now is perhaps the real meaning of the term. The word maya appears here, though not for the first time in the Gita. Just as the concepts of prakriti and Purusha are later developed in Sankhya philosophy, maya is later built into the formal structure of Vedanta, another of the six major schools of Indian philosophy. The word maya comes from the root ma, to measure out, and originally meant the power of a deity to create, especially to create what Indian philosophy calls name and form: matter and its percepts. Maya was the magical capacity to create form and  \fillusion  a gods divine power to put on a disguise, or to fling forth world after world of life. Maya is also the outward look of things, the passing show that conceals immortal being. Maya can be both delightful and dangerous, alluring and yet treacherous. The gunas, the three basic qualities of all created things, swirl within the world of maya. Crossing over the ocean of maya is the goal of the wise voyager, and one boat is devotion. In this chapter the Gita begins to stress the importance of love and devotion  themes that later become dominant. Krishnas true nature is hidden by maya (7:25). The dangers of maya are not depicted strongly in this chapter, but the delusions  moha  of life in mayas world are hinted at; they are, essentially, the self-centered attachments Krishna has been warning against. Moha, which means confusion or delusion, is something like dreaming while awake, living in a dream. The duality of attachment and aversion (love and hate) beguiles the mind into this moha-swoon right at birth (7:27). Knowing Krishna, and devotion to him, is the way beyond this delusion. Thus chapter 7 contrasts wisdom (jnana and vijnana) with the delusion (moha) of spiritual ignorance. We find here many seminal ideas that are elaborated in the later philosophies of Sankhya and Vedanta. These concepts of prakriti, Purusha, and maya do not originate with the Gita, however. The word maya appears in the Rig Veda, the most ancient of the Vedas, and Purusha is a recurring theme in the Upanishads. The Gita is a halfway point between the spontaneous insights of the Upanishads and the later, highly formalized philosophical systems. In the Gita we find an organized presentation of these and other key concepts without a cumbersome technical explanation.    \f7: Wisdom from Realization KRISHNA  With your mind intent on me, Arjuna, discipline yourself with the practice of yoga. Depend on me completely. Listen, and I will dispel all your doubts; you will come to know me fully and be united with me. 1  I will give you both jnana and vijnana. When both these are realized, there is nothing more you need to know. 2  One person in many thousands may seek perfection, yet of these only a few reach the goal and come to realize me. 4 Earth, water, fire, air, akasha, mind, intellect, and ego  these are the eight divisions of my prakriti. 5 But beyond this I have another, higher nature, Arjuna; it supports the whole universe and is the source of life in all beings. 3  In these two aspects of my nature is the womb of all creation. The birth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. 7 There is nothing that exists separate from me, Arjuna. The entire universe is suspended from me as my necklace of jewels. 6  Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings. 9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant. 8  My eternal seed, Arjuna, is to be found in every creature. I am the power of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory 10  \fof the noble. 11 In those who are strong, I am strength, free from passion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life. The states of sattva, rajas, and tamas come from me, but I am not in them. 13 These three gunas deceive the world: people fail to look beyond them to me, supreme and imperishable. 14 The three gunas make up my divine maya, difficult to overcome. But they cross over this maya who take refuge in me. 15 Others are deluded by maya; performing evil deeds, they have no devotion to me. Having lost all discrimination, they follow the way of their lower nature. 12  Good people come to worship me for different reasons. Some come to the spiritual life because of suffering, some in order to understand life; some come through a desire to achieve lifes purpose, and some come who are men and women of wisdom. 17 Unwavering in devotion, always united with me, the man or woman of wisdom surpasses all the others. To them I am the dearest beloved, and they are very dear to me. 18 All those who follow the spiritual path are blessed. But the wise who are always established in union, for whom there is no higher goal than me, may be regarded as my very Self. 16  After many births the wise seek refuge in me, seeing me everywhere and in everything. Such great souls are very rare. 20 There are others whose discrimination is misled by many desires. Following their own nature, they worship lower gods, practicing various rites. 19  When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that. 22 Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. 23 Those whose understanding is small attain only transient satisfaction: those who worship the gods go to the gods. But my devotees come to me. 21  Through lack of understanding, people believe that I, the Unmanifest, have entered into some form. They fail to realize my 24  \ftrue nature, which transcends birth and death. 25 Few see through the veil of maya. The world, deluded, does not know that I am without birth and changeless. 26 I know everything about the past, the present, and the future, Arjuna; but there is no one who knows me completely. Delusion arises from the duality of attraction and aversion, Arjuna; every creature is deluded by these from birth. 28 But those who have freed themselves from all wrongdoing are firmly established in worship of me. Their actions are pure, and they are free from the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites. 27  Those who take refuge in me, striving for liberation from old age and death, come to know Brahman, the Self, and the nature of all action. 30 Those who see me ruling the cosmos, who see me in the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva, and the adhiyajna, are conscious of me even at the time of death. 29  \fChapter_eight  Eternal Godhead This chapter alludes briefly to several important concepts presented more fully in the Upanishads, and it will be helpful to quote the Upanishads to elucidate these points. Also, this chapter presents a very ancient view of the souls journey after death. These ideas about the afterlife did not originate in the Gita, and are even more ancient than the Upanishads. Another ancient concept here is that of a cyclical universe, which is elaborated in other Hindu scriptures in great detail; this chapter merely refers to it in passing. The chapter begins with Arjuna asking what appear to be questions of theology, but the role of theologian does not fit him naturally. These questions are asked in response to the technical terms mentioned in the last verse of chapter 7. The sense of Krishnas answer is in accord with what he said earlier about his maya: he is God immanent in all things as well as God transcendent. But it is Arjunas other question that determines the direction the discourse now takes. Arjuna asks how Krishna can be known at the hour of death. Here, of course, Arjuna means Krishna in his cosmic, mystical aspect, so he is asking in essence, How can the Self-realized person enter the supreme state of immortality at the time of death? Krishna replies that whoever remembers him at the time of death will enter madbhavam, my being. If Arjuna can remember Krishna in the hour of death, he will be united with Krishna and enter into immortality. In fact, whatever it may be, the content of the mind at the hour of death directs the soul in its journey to rebirth. Thus the mind influences the evolution of the soul as it moves into the next life. Whatever a person thinks about in life  his or her deepest motivations  are likely to be the last thoughts at the time of death. So there is a continuity between this life and the next, and all the baggage of desire and motivation goes right along with the soul. But here Krishna is talking about the person  he hopes Arjuna will be such a one  who has no worldly baggage, who will remember Krishna at the final hour. To ensure he will focus his devotion on Krishna at the hour of death, Arjuna should make a practice of remembering him continually now. If he  \fmakes his mind one-pointed in meditation and learns to focus his being on Krishna, then naturally at the time of death he will think of nothing else. Otherwise, in the chaos of death, he will panic and lose his way. Krishna describes in detail what happens to consciousness at the moment of death (8:1213). These verses actually describe the yogis as being in control of the process of death. Directing their consciousness step by step through the difficult ordeal of leaving the body, they attain the supreme goal. This idea is also accepted by one of the greatest teachers of meditation in ancient India, Patanjali, who says in the Yoga Sutras that the yogi dies at will. Similar descriptions of the death process occur in the Upanishads, though there the dying person is not necessarily in control. The Upanishads give a detailed account: When the Self seems to become weak and sink into unconsciousness, the vital breaths gather to him. Then he takes with him those particles of light and descends into the heart. When the consciousness that is in the eye turns back, the dying person no longer sees any form. He is becoming one, they say; he does not see. He is becoming one, they say; he does not smell. He is becoming one, they say; he does not taste. He is becoming one, they say; he does not speak. He is becoming one, they say; he does not hear. He is becoming one, they say; he does not think or touch or know. The point of his heart lights up, and by that light the Self departs, either through the eye, or the skull, or through some other door of the body. And when he departs, life departs: and when life departs, all other vital forces depart after it. He is conscious, and with consciousness he leaves the body. Then his knowledge and his works and his previous impressions go along with him. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad iv.4.12) First consciousness is withdrawn from the senses. The dying no longer hear or see what is going on around them. They are still conscious, but the light of consciousness has been withdrawn from the senses, here called the gates of the body. There are said to be nine such gates: two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, the mouth, and the organs of generation and excretion. Sometimes two more are added: the navel and the sagittal suture, located at the top of the skull and called in Sanskrit brahmarandhra, the aperture of Brahman.  \fWhen consciousness has been withdrawn from these gates, Krishna says, the mind is placed [locked up] in the heart. (8:12) Here, as in Christian mysticism, it is the heart and not the head that is taken to be the home of the soul. Probably what is meant is the heart chakra, the center of consciousness corresponding to the center of the chest. Prana (vital energy) and awareness have been withdrawn from the outer frontiers of personality and consolidated within. At this stage of the death process an ordinary person has no access to the will; but it is just here that prana, with conscious awareness, must be made to move upwards to the head. If prana leaves the body through the brahmarandhra, there will be no rebirth: that is, the dying person will enter samadhi at the time of death. In samadhi, prana is withdrawn from lower levels of awareness to rush upwards to the seventh center at the crown of the head. This is possible only for the yogi who has thoroughly mastered meditation and the control of prana. If prana exits through some other one of the eleven doors of the body, the Upanishads say, the state of immortality will not be gained: When he departs from this body, he ascends with the rays of the sun, repeating the syllable Om. As soon as he thinks of it, he comes to the sun. That, indeed, is the door to the next world. Those who know enter; those who do not know are stopped. There is a verse: A hundred and one subtle tracks lead from the heart; One of these goes upwards to the crown of the head. Going up by it, he goes to eternal life. Others depart in various directions. (Chandogya Upanishad viii.6.56) In the Gita, as well as in this passage from the Chandogya Upanishad, the mantram Om is used. If the yogis can remember the mantram even as consciousness itself is departing the body  and, the Gita adds, if they can meditate on Krishna  they will go to the highest goal. Relinquishing the body in a state of samadhi, they attain the mystic eternity that is union with Krishna. In this chapter the Gita alludes to the two paths, northern and southern, that the soul may take after death. Verses 2425 present in  \fabbreviated form what the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad spells out in obscure detail: Those who know this, who meditate upon Truth with faith while living in the forest, go to the light, from light to day, from day to the fortnight of the moons waxing, from the waxing fortnight to the six months of the suns northern journey, from those six months to the world of the devas, from the world of the devas to the sun, from the sun to the lightning. Then a spirit approaches them and leads them to the world of Brahman. In that world they live for eternal ages. They do not return again. But those who conquer worlds through sacrifice, charity, and austerity pass into the smoke, from the smoke into the night, from the night into the fortnight of the waning moon, from the fortnight of the waning moon into the six months of the suns southern journey, from there into the world of the ancestors, from the world of the ancestors into the moon, . . and from there to rebirth. (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad vi.2.1516) Northern and southern paths refers to the path of the sun, which seems to move northward after the winter solstice and southward after the summer solstice. To die during the period in which the sun is moving southward was considered inauspicious; dying during the period after the winter solstice, when the sun is moving back north, meant the soul might take the northern path which leads to immortality. In the Gita and the Upanishads, this northern path has come to signify that the soul has been released from karma and need not be reborn. The southern path, by contrast, leads the soul to a new birth in this world, a birth suitable to its karma. This view of the souls journey after death has a primordial quality about it, giving the feeling that it far predates even the Upanishads. Perhaps it is a belief of very ancient times that found its way into the Upanishads, which say that the spiritually ready soul makes the journey of the northern route while those who have only practiced rituals take the southern. This chapter also briefly alludes to the Days and Nights of Brahma. Brahma is the Creator of the Hindu trinity, who brings forth the cosmos at the will of Vishnu. But Brahma in a sense is not in control of this creative  \fprocess. Just as day follows night in eternal, unvarying rhythm, so does the entire universe undergo cycles of creation, death, and new birth. As the Day of Brahma dawns, the cosmos comes into being; as the Day comes to an end, the entire creation dies and ceases to exist. Then, for a Night as long as the cosmic Day, the universe rests. It ceases to be  or, rather, it continues only in a subtle, unmanifest form, a dream in the mind of Vishnu, who lies sleeping on the waves of the cosmic ocean. Then, without deviating from the eternal rhythm, the cosmos is reborn when the Night is over. The new universe dawns, and Brahma once again moves into his active, creative Day. Scholars have noted that this grand vision of the cosmos being born, dying, and being reborn for eternity  cosmos after cosmos arising from the black immensity of nothingness  is quite similar to modern theories of the expanding and contracting universe put forward by contemporary cosmology. The vast time spans accepted by present-day physics are also similar to the cosmic Days and Nights of Brahma. Each Day lasts for a thousand yugas, which equals 4,320,000,000 years. For this near-eternity of time the universe lives and grows; then it dies and lies dormant for an equal time, before the new Day dawns. There is a state of being, however, that is higher than the perishable cosmos, which is not born and does not die the cosmic death. Here (8:20) it is called simply avyakta, the Unmanifest. This is the supreme goal of all living things, and it is Krishnas home (8:21). Returning to this final resting place, the soul enters into immortal bliss and is not reborn.   \f8: Eternal Godhead ARJUNA  O Krishna, what is Brahman, and what is the nature of action? What is the adhyatma, the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva? 2 What is the adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, and how is it to be offered? How are the self-controlled united with you at the time of death? 1  KRISHNA  My highest nature, the imperishable Brahman, gives every creature its existence and lives in every creature as the adhyatma. My action is creation and the bringing forth of creatures. 4 The adhibhuta is the perishable body; the adhidaiva is Purusha, eternal spirit. The adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, is made to me as the Lord within you. 3  Those who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do not doubt this. 6 Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death determines the destination of the dying; always they will tend toward that state of being. 7 Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. 8 When you make your mind one-pointed through regular practice of meditation, you will find the supreme glory of the Lord. 5  The Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler, subtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable, bright as the sun, beyond darkness. 10 Remembering him in this way at the time of death, through devotion and the power of meditation, with your mind completely stilled and your concentration fixed in 9  \fthe center of spiritual awareness between the eyebrows, you will realize the supreme Lord. I will tell you briefly of the eternal state all scriptures affirm, which can be entered only by those who are self-controlled and free from selfish passions. Those whose lives are dedicated to Brahman attain this supreme goal. 11  Remembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of the senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in meditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. 13 Repeating in this state the divine name, the syllable Om that represents the changeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the supreme goal. 12  I am easily attained by the person who always remembers me and is attached to nothing else. Such a person is a true yogi, Arjuna. 15 Great souls make their lives perfect and discover me; they are freed from mortality and the suffering of this separate existence. 16 Every creature in the universe is subject to rebirth, Arjuna, except the one who is united with me. 14  Those who understand the cosmic laws know that the Day of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas and the Night of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas. 18 When the day of Brahma dawns, forms are brought forth from the Unmanifest; when the night of Brahma comes, these forms merge in the Formless again. 19 This multitude of beings is created and destroyed again and again in the succeeding days and nights of Brahma. 20 But beyond this formless state there is another, unmanifested reality, which is eternal and is not dissolved when the cosmos is destroyed. 21 Those who realize lifes supreme goal know that I am unmanifested and unchanging. Having come home to me, they never return to separate existence. 17  This supreme Lord who pervades all existence, the true Self of all creatures, may be realized through undivided love. 23 There are two paths, Arjuna, which the soul may follow at the time of death. One leads to rebirth and the other to liberation. 22  \fThe six months of the northern path of the sun, the path of light, of fire, of day, of the bright fortnight, leads knowers of Brahman to the supreme goal. 25 The six months of the southern path of the sun, the path of smoke, of night, of the dark fortnight, leads other souls to the light of the moon and to rebirth. 24  These two paths, the light and the dark, are said to be eternal, leading some to liberation and others to rebirth. 27 Once you have known these two paths, Arjuna, you can never be deluded again. Attain this knowledge through perseverance in yoga. 28 There is merit in studying the scriptures, in selfless service, austerity, and giving, but the practice of meditation carries you beyond all these to the supreme abode of the highest Lord. 26  \fChapter_nine  The Royal Path This chapter praises Krishna as the Supreme Being who has created the world and dwells immanent in his creation. Krishnas exalted nature is stressed, and warning is given to those who think that God is limited to his creation. It is true that Krishna has taken on a human form, but those who see only a limited human being and show him disrespect are courting great spiritual harm. These verses contain a warning for those who would underestimate Krishnas divine power. In this chapter Krishna replaces the many gods and goddesses of the usual Hindu pantheon, each of which represents a different divine power; here Krishna is seen as containing within himself all such powers. It is Krishna and Krishna alone who is to be worshipped: he is the goal, the support, the only refuge, the one true friend; he is the beginning and the end (9:18). It follows that those who practice a ritual religion, offering the ritual sacrifices ordained by the Vedas, do not attain the true goal of their lives. True, they do enjoy heaven after death. But when their store of merit is used up, they are born again in order to have another chance at turning away from personal gain and aiming at lifes supreme goal. So long as they are motivated only by self-centered desires they must be born again and again, and their spiritual evolution either stands still or they make very little progress. Even these souls, however, are really worshipping Krishna, though they do not know it. They seek Krishna, the Supreme Being, in all their wanderings through many, many lives and even in their sojourns in heaven, where they enjoy the reward of their good deeds. Because they do not know his real nature, however, they will not attain the goal, but will be reborn. An endless round of rebirths may seem like a living damnation of the struggling soul  a harsh note that would be uncharacteristic of the Gita. But this is not a question of damnation. The purpose of life is to realize God, and until this is done, the soul cannot escape creating more karma which has to be worked out, however many lives it might take. The choice to turn toward Self-realization is always open.  \fThe Gita does not dwell on the obstacles, however, but quickly goes on to reveal Krishnas more compassionate nature. It makes the point that whatever a person deeply desires  whatever he or she worships  will eventually be attained, in some life or other. In particular, to have real, selfless love, regardless of the object, is to love Krishna, the ultimate good. This kind of love, called bhakti, is far more potent than observances and rituals  a point the Gita is slowly revealing. But to have this devotion without understanding Krishnas nature is not enough. In the end, to attain his goal, Arjuna must have devotion and understand it is Krishnas universal aspect that he loves. Then he will truly attain the eternal, immortal state. This chapter contains a famous and very popular series of verses: Whatever you do, make it an offering to me  the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. In this way you will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and painful. (9:2728) Krishna accepts every offering made to him in the right spirit; he assures Arjuna of this. Then he demands that Arjuna make everything  every act, every meal, every sacrifice, every gift, even his sufferings  an offering to God. He demands this so that Arjuna can be released from the bondage of karma. This is a new emphasis, a new way. If Arjuna can live in complete union with Krishnas will, doing everything for Krishna alone, then by that very purity of will he will be free from selfish motives and thus released from karma. His spirit will be free, and he will attain his goal of mystic union with Krishna. Krishna declares that he is impartial to all creatures: he neither favors nor rejects anyone. It is their sincere love that is important. Those who are truly devoted to Krishna live in him, and he abides in them. With some daring, probably at the risk of discomfort to the more orthodox, Krishna adds that even a sinner who takes wholehearted refuge in him becomes good. The word used is sadhu, which literally means a good person but has come to signify one who leads the spiritual life, giving up all selfish desires to achieve the final goal. The word for sinner, sudurachara, should not be passed by either. Su is literally good; dur is bad: thus one whose conduct is really bad, as we might say good and hot to mean really hot.  \fKrishna promises that his devotees must attain peace at last. No one who has genuine love and devotion can perish. The meaning here is taken to be perish in a spiritual sense, come to spiritual harm. The message of this chapter is simple. It contains no philosophy and only a little theology. The one message is: anyone who has real love, love for the Lord of Love who is in all creatures, will in the end attain the goal. This is the royal secret that Krishna had promised to reveal.   \f9: The Royal Path KRISHNA  Because of your faith, I shall tell you the most profound of secrets: obtaining both jnana and vijnana, you will be free from all evil. 1  This royal knowledge, this royal secret, is the greatest purifier. Righteous and imperishable, it is a joy to practice and can be directly experienced. 3 But those who have no faith in the supreme law of life do not find me, Arjuna. They return to the world, passing from death to death. 2  I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifested form. All creatures find their existence in me, but I am not limited by them. 5 Behold my divine mystery! These creatures do not really dwell in me, and though I bring them forth and support them, I am not confined within them. 6 They move in me as the winds move in every direction in space. 4  At the end of the eon these creatures return to unmanifested matter; at the beginning of the next cycle I send them forth again. 8 Controlling my prakriti, again and again I bring forth these myriad forms and subject them to the laws of prakriti. 9 None of these actions binds me, Arjuna. I am unattached to them, so they do not disturb my nature. 7  Under my watchful eye the laws of nature take their course. Thus is the world set in motion; thus the animate and the inanimate are created. 10  \fThe immature do not look beyond physical appearances to see my true nature as the Lord of all creation. 12 The knowledge of such deluded people is empty; their lives are fraught with disaster and evil, and their work and hopes are all in vain. 11  But truly great souls seek my divine nature. They worship me with a one-pointed mind, having realized that I am the eternal source of all. 14 Constantly striving, they make firm their resolve and worship me without wavering. Full of devotion, they sing of my divine glory. 13  Others follow the path of jnana, spiritual wisdom. They see that where there is One, that One is me; where there are many, all are me; they see my face everywhere. 15  I am the ritual and the sacrifice; I am true medicine and the mantram. I am the offering and the fire which consumes it, and the one to whom it is offered. 16  I am the father and mother of this universe, and its grandfather too; I am its entire support. I am the sum of all knowledge, the purifier, the syllable Om; I am the sacred scriptures, the Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas. 17  I am the goal of life, the Lord and support of all, the inner witness, the abode of all. I am the only refuge, the one true friend; I am the beginning, the staying, and the end of creation; I am the womb and the eternal seed. 18  I am heat; I give and withhold the rain. I am immortality and I am death; I am what is and what is not. 19  Those who follow the rituals given in the Vedas, who offer sacrifices and take soma, free themselves from evil and attain the vast heaven of the gods, where they enjoy celestial pleasures. 21 When they have enjoyed these fully, their merit is exhausted and they return to this land of death. Thus observing Vedic rituals but caught in an endless chain of desires, they come and go. 20  \fThose who worship me and meditate on me constantly, without any other thought  I will provide for all their needs. 22  Those who worship other gods with faith and devotion also worship me, Arjuna, even if they do not observe the usual forms. 24 I am the object of all worship, its enjoyer and Lord. But those who fail to realize my true nature must be reborn. 25 Those who worship the devas will go to the realm of the devas; those who worship their ancestors will be united with them after death. Those who worship phantoms will become phantoms; but my devotees will come to me. 23  Whatever I am offered in devotion with a pure heart  a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water  I accept with joy. 27 Whatever you do, make it an offering to me  the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. 28 In this way you will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and painful. Then, firm in renunciation and yoga, with your heart free, you will come to me. 26  I look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and none more dear. But those who worship me with love live in me, and I come to life in them. 29  Even sinners become holy when they take refuge in me alone. 31 Quickly their souls conform to dharma and they attain to boundless peace. Never forget this, Arjuna: no one who is devoted to me will ever come to harm. 30  All those who take refuge in me, whatever their birth, race, sex, or caste, will attain the supreme goal; this realization can be attained even by those whom society scorns. 33 Kings and sages too seek this goal with devotion. Therefore, having been born in this transient and forlorn world, give all your love to me. 34 Fill your mind with me; love me; serve me; worship me always. Seeking me in your heart, you will at last be united with me. 32  \fChapter_ten  Divine Splendor Krishna goes deeper into the revelation of his divine being, revealing himself as the source from which all things come, the One who is the reality behind the many. Though the source of all virtues, he is also the ultimate reality that transcends all opposites. Thus he is both happiness and suffering, birth and death, being and nonbeing. Like the Brahman of the Upanishads, he is beyond duality, utterly beyond the constricting categories of the things of this world. His true nature is beyond the reach of thought. He can only be known in the state of samadhi, where knower and known become one. Arjuna calls Krishna Purushottama, the supreme Purusha, the supreme Person. Krishna is now no human charioteer but Bhagavan, the munificent Lord; and Arjuna, leaving his warrior persona behind, now stands revealed as a seeker after truth. At Arjunas request, Krishna now reveals a few of his divine powers and attributes (vibhutis). From this point on the chapter becomes difficult because of the many unfamiliar names that are mentioned. In whatever category, Krishna is the chief, the best, the most intense, the most beautiful, the most awesome, the essence. Many of the allusions will be familiar  for example, among rivers Krishna is the Ganges. But many of the names come from Hindu mythology and are not well known. There is no room here to explain every name, but the following paragraphs will highlight a few of importance. First, Krishna is the Atman, the inner Self in all beings. It is fitting that this be mentioned first, for of all his myriad manifestations this is the most important, at least to the struggling spiritual aspirant that is Arjuna. Krishna is Arjunas innermost Self, and that is how he is to be known in contemplation. Of all the forms in which to meditate upon Krishna, the Atman is mentioned first. Krishna is Vishnu, the great compassionate, sustaining God of the Hindu faith. It is Vishnu who cares so much about the sufferings of Mother Earth and her children that he comes to earth again and again, in age after age, to relieve oppression and renew righteousness.  \fKrishna is the sun, worshipped in India since ancient times. He is Indra, the chief of the Vedic gods, the lord of storm and battle, who hurls the thunderbolt against the enemies of the gods. In Vedic religion he is a mighty lord, not to be trifled with, but later on he must admit defeat at the hands of Krishna, who protects the people from Indras stormy wrath. Krishna is also Shankara, the more beneficent aspect of the awesome deity Rudra, better known as Shiva. Among mountains Krishna is Meru, the high mountain home of Shiva and the other gods, the highest peak and center of the world. Krishna is consciousness, the syllable Om, and the mantram or holy name. He is the mythic horse and the fabulous elephant that were produced when the cosmic ocean was churned for the elixir of immortality. Krishna is Ananta, the cosmic serpent on which Lord Vishnu sleeps. He is Varuna, Vedic god of the oceans, and Yama, the god of death; among demons (asuras) he is Prahlada, who, though born in the race of demons, was devoted to God and never swayed in his love, even when his own father tried to kill him. And of course Krishna is Rama, the great warriorprince  also an incarnation of Vishnu  whose exploits are told in the immortal epic, the Ramayana. Of all fields of knowledge, Krishna says, he is knowledge of the Self. The study of Sanskrit and its grammar were important in ancient India, and Krishna doesnt neglect this field. He is A among letters; among compound words he is the dvandva, which joins equals. He is the Gayatri  a particular meter found in the poetry of the Vedas, but generally taken to be a famous prayer from the Rig Veda (iii.62.10) composed in that meter, which has been chanted every morning by countless worshippers for three thousand years. It is fitting that among seasons Krishna is the spring, the season of flowers. Less easily understood is his claim to be the gambling of gamblers. Krishna has a sense of play, and as gambling is the obsession of the gambler, it seems natural that Krishna might claim this as a vibhuti. Also, in ancient India gambling was considered a royal pastime, and no king of repute would refuse a friendly game of dice. In the human realm, Krishna is the son of Vasudeva, a prince of the Vrishni line  in other words, the human form that is Arjunas friend and charioteer. He is also Arjuna! And he is Vyasa, the composer of the Gita  indeed, of the whole Mahabharata.  \fWherever Arjuna finds strength, beauty, or power, Krishna concludes, he should recognize it as coming from a spark of Krishnas glory. Then, after overwhelming Arjuna with this stupendous list of divine powers and revelations, Krishna asks casually, But what use is it to know all of these details? The important fact is to know that I am, and that a tiny portion of my being supports all things.   \f10: Divine Splendor KRISHNA  Listen further, Arjuna, to my supreme teaching, which gives you such joy. Desiring your welfare, O strong-armed warrior, I will tell you more. 1  Neither gods nor sages know my origin, for I am the source from which the gods and sages come. 3 Whoever knows me as the Lord of all creation, without birth or beginning, knows the truth and frees himself from all evil. 2  Discrimination, wisdom, understanding, forgiveness, truth, selfcontrol, and peace of mind; pleasure and pain, birth and death, fear and courage, honor and dishonor; 5 nonviolence, charity, equanimity, contentment, and perseverance in spiritual disciplines  all the different qualities found in living creatures have their source in me. 4  The seven great sages and the four ancient ancestors were born from my mind and received my power. From them came all the creatures of this world. 7 Whoever understands my power and the mystery of my manifestations comes without doubt to be united with me. 6  I am the source from which all creatures evolve. The wise remember this and worship me with loving devotion. 9 Their thoughts are all absorbed in me, and all their vitality flows to me. Teaching one another, talking about me always, they are happy and fulfilled. 8  \fTo those steadfast in love and devotion I give spiritual wisdom, so that they may come to me. 11 Out of compassion I destroy the darkness of their ignorance. From within them I light the lamp of wisdom and dispel all darkness from their lives. 10  ARJUNA  You are Brahman supreme, the highest abode, the supreme purifier, the self-luminous, eternal spirit, first among the gods, unborn and infinite. 13 The great sages and seers  Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa too  have acclaimed you thus; now you have declared it to me yourself. 12  Now, O Krishna, I believe that everything you have told me is divine truth. O Lord, neither gods nor demons know your real nature. 15 Indeed, you alone know yourself, O supreme spirit. You are the source of being and the master of every creature, God of gods, the Lord of the universe. 14  Tell me all your divine attributes, leaving nothing unsaid. Tell me of the glories with which you fill the cosmos. 17 Krishna, you are a supreme master of yoga. Tell me how I should meditate to gain constant awareness of you. In what things and in what ways should I meditate on you? 18 O Krishna, you who stir up peoples hearts, tell me in detail your attributes and your powers; I can never tire of hearing your immortal words. 16  KRISHNA  All right, Arjuna, I will tell you of my divine powers. I will mention only the most glorious; for there is no end to them. 19  I am the true Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence. 20  Among the shining gods I am Vishnu; of luminaries I am the sun; among the storm gods I am Marichi, and in the night sky I am the moon. 21  \fAmong scriptures I am the Sama Veda, and among the lesser gods I am Indra. Among the senses I am the mind, and in living beings I am consciousness. 22  Among the Rudras I am Shankara. Among the spirits of the natural world I am Kubera, god of wealth, and Pavaka, the purifying fire. Among mountains I am Meru. 23  Among priests I am Brihaspati, and among military leaders I am Skanda. Among bodies of water I am the ocean. 24  Among the great seers I am Bhrigu, and among words, the syllable Om; I am the repetition of the holy name, and among mountains I am the Himalayas. 25  Among trees I am the ashvattha, the sacred fig; among the gandharvas, the heavenly musicians, I am Chitraratha. Among divine seers I am Narada, and among sages I am Kapila. 26  I was born from the nectar of immortality as the primordial horse and as Indras noble elephant. Among human beings, I am the king. 27  Among weapons I am the thunderbolt. I am Kamadhuk, the cow that fulfills all desires; I am Kandarpa, the power of sex, and Vasuki, the king of snakes. 28  I am Ananta, the cosmic serpent, and Varuna, the god of water; I am Aryaman among the noble ancestors. Among the forces which restrain I am Yama, the god of death. 29  Among animals I am the lion; among birds, the eagle Garuda. I am Prahlada, born among the demons, and of all that measures, I am time. 30  Among purifying forces I am the wind; among warriors, Rama. Of water creatures I am the crocodile, and of rivers I am the Ganges. 31  \fI am the beginning, middle, and end of creation. Of all the sciences I am the science of Self-knowledge, and I am logic in those who debate. 33 Among letters I am A; among grammatical compounds I am the dvandva. I am infinite time, and the sustainer whose face is seen everywhere. 32  I am death, which overcomes all, and the source of all beings still to be born. I am the feminine qualities: fame, beauty, perfect speech, memory, intelligence, loyalty, and forgiveness. 34  Among the hymns of the Sama Veda I am the Brihat; among poetic meters, the Gayatri. Among months I am Margashirsha, first of the year; among seasons I am spring, that brings forth flowers. 35  I am the gambling of the gambler and the radiance in all that shines. I am effort, I am victory, and I am the goodness of the virtuous. 36  Among the Vrishnis I am Krishna, and among the Pandavas I am Arjuna. Among sages I am Vyasa, and among poets, Ushanas. 37  I am the scepter which metes out punishment, and the art of statesmanship in those who lead. I am the silence of the unknown and the wisdom of the wise. 38  I am the seed that can be found in every creature, Arjuna; for without me nothing can exist, neither animate nor inanimate. 39  But there is no end to my divine attributes, Arjuna; these I have mentioned are only a few. 41 Wherever you find strength, or beauty, or spiritual power, you may be sure that these have sprung from a spark of my essence. 40  But of what use is it to you to know all this, Arjuna? Just remember that I am, and that I support the entire cosmos with only a fragment of my being. 42  \fChapter_eleven  The Cosmic Vision This is the most exalted chapter of the entire Gita, for here Arjuna sees the divine vision of Krishna in his full nature as God himself, Lord of the Universe. It is difficult to see at first why the ultimate spiritual vision should be granted to Arjuna at this point. We must remember that Krishna and Arjuna have been companions for many lives. Yet at the opening of the Gita, Arjuna is a warrior, little concerned with mystic visions. Step by step Krishna has led him to an understanding of the real purpose of his life  to know who he is and to know also who Krishna is. In the last chapter, Krishna had reached the point where he was willing to reveal to Arjuna the manifestations of divine power. Arjuna had not only asked about those powers, but had even wanted to know in which forms he might meditate on Krishna  the first time Arjuna had spoken of contemplation. Now, in chapter 11, Arjuna asks to see Krishna as He really is. His desire is granted, and in essence the rest of the chapter describes Arjunas samadhi. Samadhi is the word used by Patanjali in his classic work, the Yoga Sutras, to describe the final stage in meditation, in which the mind is completely concentrated and a superconscious mode of knowing comes into play. Patanjali speaks of many different kinds of samadhi, but for practical purposes we may speak of two: savikalpa and nirvikalpa. Arjunas vision begins with savikalpa samadhi, in which he sees God in a personal manifestation. Then, as he passes into nirvikalpa samadhi, Arjuna sees all forms disappearing into God, until only a supernatural fire consuming the entire phenomenal world is left. This supreme vision dazzles Arjuna with the blinding splendor of a thousand suns. Mystics have often described their experiences in terms of light. In an ancient prayer of the Veda, the poet asks for divine wisdom to dawn in his heart just as the sun rises in the sky. And in the West we have countless testimonies like that of St. Teresa of Avila: When the soul looks upon this Divine Sun, the brightness dazzles it. . And very often it remains completely blind, absorbed, amazed, and dazzled by all the wonders it sees.  \fAs this vision begins to unfold, Arjuna sees the whole world in the body of Krishna and he begins a hymn of praise. He sees Krishna as Vishnu with his traditional weapons, the mace and the discus, and wearing a crown. As the vision becomes more intense, Arjuna begins to feel afraid. He sees the light of God become a fire that burns to consume all things, as if at the end of time. All the warriors on the battlefield are mortals, and Arjuna sees them slain, burning in the universal fire. All creatures rush to destruction like moths into a flame. Gods radiance is both a great light and a burning fire. Terrified, Arjuna wants to know the identity of this awesome God, who bears no resemblance now to the Krishna he had known as his teacher and friend. In answer to the question, Who are you? Krishnas reply is the verse (11:32) that burst into Robert Oppenheimers mind when he saw the atomic bomb explode over Trinity in the summer of 1945: I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds. . But the word kala means not just death but time, which eventually devours all. Arjuna is brave, and worthy of this vision, for he does not lose consciousness or completely break down. He praises Krishna and then asks for forgiveness if during their long friendship he has ever said or done anything to offend the Lord through mistaking him for a mere human being. Finally, the vision is too much for Arjuna. Though he experiences the deep peace and joy of samadhi, he is terrified at the same time. He wishes to see the more human face of God. Krishna grants his desire and returns to his gentle, normal aspect. He tells Arjuna how very difficult it is to see him in his exalted form as the Lord of Yoga, the God of gods. Only pure devotion attains this vision. This theme dominates the remaining chapters of the Gita: it is devotion that is allimportant on the spiritual quest.    \f11: The Cosmic Vision ARJUNA  Out of compassion you have taught me the supreme mystery of the Self. Through your words my delusion is gone. 2 You have explained the origin and end of every creature, O lotus-eyed one, and told me of your own supreme, limitless existence. 1  Just as you have described your infinite glory, O Lord, now I long to see it. I want to see you as the supreme ruler of creation. 4 O Lord, master of yoga, if you think me strong enough to behold it, show me your immortal Self. 3  KRISHNA  Behold, Arjuna, a million divine forms, with an infinite variety of color and shape. 6 Behold the gods of the natural world, and many more wonders never revealed before. 7 Behold the entire cosmos turning within my body, and the other things you desire to see. 5  But these things cannot be seen with your physical eyes; therefore I give you spiritual vision to perceive my majestic power. 8  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, Krishna, the master of yoga, revealed to Arjuna his most exalted, lordly form. 9  He appeared with an infinite number of faces, ornamented by heavenly jewels, displaying unending miracles and the countless weapons of his power. 11 Clothed in celestial garments and covered with garlands, sweet-smelling with heavenly fragrances, he showed 10  \fhimself as the infinite Lord, the source of all wonders, whose face is everywhere. If a thousand suns were to rise in the heavens at the same time, the blaze of their light would resemble the splendor of that supreme spirit. 12  There, within the body of the God of gods, Arjuna saw all the manifold forms of the universe united as one. 14 Filled with amazement, his hair standing on end in ecstasy, he bowed before the Lord with joined palms and spoke these words. 13  ARJUNA  O Lord, I see within your body all the gods and every kind of living creature. I see Brahma, the Creator, seated on a lotus; I see the ancient sages and the celestial serpents. 15  I see infinite mouths and arms, stomachs and eyes, and you are embodied in every form. I see you everywhere, without beginning, middle, or end. You are the Lord of all creation, and the cosmos is your body. 16  You wear a crown and carry a mace and discus; your radiance is blinding and immeasurable. I see you, who are so difficult to behold, shining like a fiery sun blazing in every direction. 17  You are the supreme, changeless Reality, the one thing to be known. You are the refuge of all creation, the immortal spirit, the eternal guardian of eternal dharma. 18  You are without beginning, middle, or end; you touch everything with your infinite power. The sun and moon are your eyes, and your mouth is fire; your radiance warms the cosmos. 19  O Lord, your presence fills the heavens and the earth and reaches in every direction. I see the three worlds trembling before this vision of your wonderful and terrible form. 20  \fThe gods enter your being, some calling out and greeting you in fear. Great saints sing your glory, praying, May all be well! 21  The multitudes of gods, demigods, and demons are all overwhelmed by the sight of you. 23 O mighty Lord, at the sight of your myriad eyes and mouths, arms and legs, stomachs and fearful teeth, I and the entire universe shake in terror. 22  O Vishnu, I can see your eyes shining; with open mouth, you glitter in an array of colors, and your body touches the sky. I look at you and my heart trembles; I have lost all courage and all peace of mind. 24  When I see your mouths with their fearful teeth, mouths burning like the fires at the end of time, I forget where I am and I have no place to go. O Lord, you are the support of the universe; have mercy on me! 25  I see all the sons of Dhritarashtra; I see Bhishma, Drona, and Karna; I see our warriors and all the kings who are here to fight. 27 All are rushing into your awful jaws; I see some of them crushed by your teeth. 28 As rivers flow into the ocean, all the warriors of this world are passing into your fiery jaws; 29 all creatures rush to their destruction like moths into a flame. 26  You lap the worlds into your burning mouths and swallow them. Filled with your terrible radiance, O Vishnu, the whole of creation bursts into flames. 30  Tell me who you are, O Lord of terrible form. I bow before you; have mercy! I want to know who you are, you who existed before all creation. Your nature and workings confound me. 31  KRISHNA  I am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world. Even without your participation, all the warriors gathered here will die. 32  \fTherefore arise, Arjuna; conquer your enemies and enjoy the glory of sovereignty. I have already slain all these warriors; you will only be my instrument. 33  Bhishma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna, and many others are already slain. Kill those whom I have killed. Do not hesitate. Fight in this battle and you will conquer your enemies. 34  SANJAYA  Having heard these words, Arjuna trembled in fear. With joined palms he bowed before Krishna and addressed him stammering. 35  ARJUNA  O Krishna, it is right that the world delights and rejoices in your praise, that all the saints and sages bow down to you and all evil flees before you to the far corners of the universe. 36  How could they not worship you, O Lord? You are the eternal spirit, who existed before Brahma the Creator and who will never cease to be. Lord of the gods, you are the abode of the universe. Changeless, you are what is and what is not, and beyond the duality of existence and nonexistence. 37  You are the first among the gods, the timeless spirit, the resting place of all beings. You are the knower and the thing which is known. You are the final home; with your infinite form you pervade the cosmos. 38  You are Vayu, god of wind; Yama, god of death; Agni, god of fire; Varuna, god of water. You are the moon and the creator Prajapati, and the great-grandfather of all creatures. I bow before you and salute you again and again. 39  You are behind me and in front of me; I bow to you on every side. Your power is immeasurable. You pervade everything; you are everything. 40  \fSometimes, because we were friends, I rashly said, Oh, Krishna! Say, friend!  casual, careless remarks. Whatever I may have said lightly, whether we were playing or resting, alone or in company, sitting together or eating, 42 if it was disrespectful, forgive me for it, O Krishna. I did not know the greatness of your nature, unchanging and imperishable. 41  You are the father of the universe, of the animate and the inanimate; you are the object of all worship, the greatest guru. There is none to equal you in the three worlds. Who can match your power? 44 O gracious Lord, I prostrate myself before you and ask for your blessing. As a father forgives his son, or a friend a friend, or a lover his beloved, so should you forgive me. 43  I rejoice in seeing you as you have never been seen before, yet I am filled with fear by this vision of you as the abode of the universe. Please let me see you again as the shining God of gods. 46 Though you are the embodiment of all creation, let me see you again not with a thousand arms but with four, carrying the mace and discus and wearing a crown. 45  KRISHNA  Arjuna, through my grace you have been united with me and received this vision of my radiant, universal form, without beginning or end, which no one else has ever seen. 47  Not by knowledge of the Vedas, nor sacrifice, nor charity, nor rituals, nor even by severe asceticism has any other mortal seen what you have seen, O heroic Arjuna. 48  Do not be troubled; do not fear my terrible form. Let your heart be satisfied and your fears dispelled in looking at me as I was before. 49  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, the Lord once again assumed the gentle form of Krishna and consoled his devotee, who had been so 50  \fafraid. ARJUNA  O Krishna, now that I have seen your gentle human form my mind is again composed and returned to normal. 51  KRISHNA  It is extremely difficult to obtain the vision you have had; even the gods long always to see me in this aspect. 53 Neither knowledge of the Vedas, nor austerity, nor charity, nor sacrifice can bring the vision you have seen. 54 But through unfailing devotion, Arjuna, you can know me, see me, and attain union with me. 55 Those who make me the supreme goal of all their work and act without selfish attachment, who devote themselves to me completely and are free from ill will for any creature, enter into me. 52  \fChapter_twelve  The Way of Love This short chapter focuses upon the supreme importance of devotion and faith in spiritual development. Here love, or personal devotion, is the most powerful motivation in spiritual life. The worlds great religions agree on this point. All religions allow for a way of devotion, and millions of men and women have found spiritual fulfillment in devotion to Christ, the Buddha, or Muhammad. Hinduism has allowed a place for the path of knowledge as well as the path of devotion; here, however, the Gita stresses the efficacy of devotion. The Upanishads, the final word on mystic experience uttered by the Vedas, stressed the ultimate reality, the eternal truth behind the ephemeral things of this world. The teachers of the Upanishads told their students to seek knowledge of the Atman, their true Self. The consummation of this knowledge was to know that the Self within was one with Brahman, the ultimate reality pervading all things. This was encapsulated in the statement Tat tvam asi, You are that  that imperishable being, that immortal Reality. Brahman, the nameless, formless Godhead, could be known only in the superconscious state. The Gita moves away from such an approach to religion. For as Krishna says, seeking an eternal, indefinable, hidden Godhead is rather a tall order for the average (or even above average) person. In fact, in this chapter it is said to be beyond the reach of practically all embodied beings (dehavat, those who have bodies). This path of wisdom may be just too spiritual for earths children, because those who identify to a large degree with their physical nature find the way of knowledge too steep a climb. We can turn to one of the Western followers of this path to see why; this is Dionysius the Areopagite, a Christian monk of the fifth century, sounding remarkably like verses 34 of this very chapter: Then, beyond all distinction between knower and known, the aspirant becomes merged in the nameless, formless Reality, wholly absorbed in That which is beyond all things and in nothing else. . Having stilled  \fhis intellect and mind, he is united by his highest faculty with That which is beyond all knowing. Fortunately there is the path of love; for when God is loved in personal aspect, the way is vastly easier. According to the Hindu scriptures, God can be loved as a merciful father, a divine mother, a wise friend, a passionate beloved, or even as a mischievous child. We might turn to the Christian mystics for help here, for most of them have walked the way of love. The medieval Christian work called The Cloud of Unknowing states that love is the sure, safe path to God: By love He can be gotten and holden, by thought never. In a well-known passage in the New Testament, St. Paul puts love above knowledge and even above miraculous powers: But I shall give you a more excellent way. . Love never faileth. But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. Whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. And St. John of the Cross tells concisely why the vast majority of human beings find it easier to overcome their weaknesses through love than through knowledge: In order to overcome our desires and to renounce all those things, our love and inclination for which are wont to inflame the will that it delights therein, we require a more ardent fire and a nobler love  that of the Bridegroom. . if our spiritual nature were not on fire with other and nobler passions, we should never cast off the yoke of the senses. But such love is often not forthcoming in the struggling soul, even in one like Arjuna. So Krishna says that if Arjuna is not able to focus his devotion, he should learn to do so through the regular practice of meditation. Even love and devotion can be cultivated through regular practice; they neednt be regarded as mysterious forces, divine gifts of the spirit. If even the attempt at regular practice should fail, Krishna is still not ready to let Arjuna admit defeat. He should, Krishna says, work selflessly without desire for the fruits of his labors. But real peace of mind comes only from renunciation. The word tyaga here seems to mean renunciation or abandonment of self-will more than anything else. Such self-surrender may be a last resort, but if it is genuine it brings immediate peace.  \fVerses 1320 describe the characteristics of the genuine lover of God. Such a saintly person, Krishna points out, is greatly loved and dear to Krishna himself.   \f12: The Way of Love ARJUNA  Of those steadfast devotees who love you and those who seek you as the eternal formless Reality, who are the more established in yoga? 1  KRISHNA  Those who set their hearts on me and worship me with unfailing devotion and faith are more established in yoga. 2  As for those who seek the transcendental Reality, without name, without form, contemplating the Unmanifested, beyond the reach of thought and of feeling, 4 with their senses subdued and mind serene and striving for the good of all beings, they too will verily come unto me. 3  Yet hazardous and slow is the path to the Unrevealed, difficult for physical creatures to tread. 6 But they for whom I am the supreme goal, who do all work renouncing self for me and meditate on me with single-hearted devotion, 7 these I will swiftly rescue from the fragments cycle of birth and death, for their consciousness has entered into me. 5  Still your mind in me, still your intellect in me, and without doubt you will be united with me forever. 9 If you cannot still your mind in me, learn to do so through the regular practice of meditation. 10 If you lack the will for such self-discipline, engage yourself in my work, for selfless service can lead you at last to complete fulfillment. 11 If you are unable to do even this, surrender yourself to 8  \fme, disciplining yourself and renouncing the results of all your actions. Better indeed is knowledge than mechanical practice. Better than knowledge is meditation. But better still is surrender of attachment to results, because there follows immediate peace. 12  That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure and pain, 14 patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me  with such as these I am in love. 13  Not agitating the world or by it agitated, they stand above the sway of elation, competition, and fear: that one is my beloved. 15  They are detached, pure, efficient, impartial, never anxious, selfless in all their undertakings; they are my devotees, very dear to me. 16  That one is dear to me who runs not after the pleasant or away from the painful, grieves not, lusts not, but lets things come and go as they happen. 17  That devotee who looks upon friend and foe with equal regard, who is not buoyed up by praise nor cast down by blame, alike in heat and cold, pleasure and pain, free from selfish attachments, 19 the same in honor and dishonor, quiet, ever full, in harmony everywhere, firm in faith  such a one is dear to me. 18  Those who meditate upon this immortal dharma as I have declared it, full of faith and seeking me as lifes supreme goal, are truly my devotees, and my love for them is very great. 20  \fChapter_thirteen  The Field & the Knower This chapter presents us with two sweeping categories: the field and the knower of the field. To simplify, we may think of the field as the body and the knower of the field as the Self that resides in the body. This chapter, then, is about the duality between soul and body. This duality is seen as eternal, a basic division of all things  a fundamental concept elaborated in Sankhya philosophy. We said that the field is the body, but this is not precise enough. The field also includes the mind: in fact, it comprises all the components of prakriti including ahamkara  the awareness each of us has that we are an individual ego, from aham I and kara maker. Ahamkara is the basic awareness of separateness: that which makes me I, a being separate from the rest of creation. In this wide sense the field encompasses everything, except for the elusive consciousness that knows the field. The field is the object; the knower is the subject. Krishna is the hidden knower of the field: that is, the Self. This term field is a surprisingly modern one, for it describes what today we might call an extension of the continuum of mass, energy, time, and space to include the strata of mind as well  in other words, a field of forces both physical and mental. Just as physics no longer regards matter and energy as essentially separate, the Gita would not regard matter and mind as separate; they are different aspects of prakriti, the underlying stuff of existence. Another dimension of Krishnas use of the word field is brought out by a traditional Hindu anecdote. A wandering sadhu or holy man is asked what his work in life is; he replies, Im a farmer. When the questioner looks surprised he adds, This body of mine is my field. I sow good thoughts and actions, and in my body I reap the results. The Buddha explains, All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts; it is made of our thoughts. What we think, we become, for as Emerson says, the ancestor of every action is a thought. Thus our thoughts, taken together, bear fruit in the actions, decisions, and desires that shape our lives. In part, the body bears the fruit of what we think insofar as our way of  \fthinking affects our health and safety. But in a larger sense, the whole field of human activity (indeed the whole of prakriti) is also a field of karma  where, for example, the global environment is shaped by the sum of what its inhabitants do, which in turn is shaped by how they think. This idea will be picked up and elaborated on in detail in the concluding chapters of the Gita. Verses 711 then describe the person who understands his or her own true nature. This is an attractive picture of the modest, truly wise person who is in control of his or her own life. One implication of these verses is that it is quite an achievement to understand the difference between the field and the Self, the knower. Most people confuse the two, taking the body and mind to be who they are. In the usual course of events, we may be totally unaware that there is a Self, a consciousness underneath the surface awareness of a separate I. Verses 1217 describe the ultimate underlying reality: Brahman, pure, undifferentiated consciousness, the divine ground of existence. Verse 19 returns us to the discussion of the basic duality of mind/matter and spirit (Self). Again the technical terms prakriti and Purusha are used. Purusha is the knower and prakriti the field. From the union of these two all things are born. Both prakriti and Purusha are essential to the creation of the world: nothing could exist without the spiritual basis of Purusha, and nothing could develop in a manifest form without the mind and matter of prakriti. With its need to think of abstract principles in human terms, Hinduism embodies these two eternal principles in the figures of Shiva and Shakti, the divine Father and Mother. The Gita does not mention these two because it comes essentially from the Vishnu tradition, but in the other great stream of the Hindu faith, Shiva is the eternal Spirit, the Absolute, represented as dwelling aloof on the mountain peak of spiritual peace. Shakti, the Divine Mother, is his creative partner, and without her, Shiva could never have created the world. Shakti  she has many names in her various manifestations  rules in the realm of birth and death; Shiva, Purusha, lives in the realm of the immortal. Together the two represent Brahman, the attributeless Godhead, and the creative power of the Godhead called maya. Thus it is in the union of Shiva and Shakti that all things are born. This chapter emphasizes that the Self, the real knower, is ever uninvolved in the shifting forces that play over the field. There is no possibility of any  \fsoul being eternally lost, for all beings partake of the immortal, pure nature of Purusha. We may endure countless eons of birth and death, but we must finally find our rest in the eternal spirit. By definition, nothing taking place in the realm of prakriti can affect Purusha; but the exact nature of the interaction of these two is a profound mystery. Verse 32 explains this mystery by drawing a comparison with akasha, the subtlest element recognized by the ancient philosophers. Akasha is space itself. Just as space pervades the cosmos, yet remains pure even in the midst of impure things, so the Self remains completely pure, even though it dwells in all things. Though it seems to live in the land of mortals and to undergo change and death, the real knower in every creature is deathless, hidden in the heart.   \f13: The Field & the Knower KRISHNA  The body is called a field, Arjuna; the one who knows it is called the Knower of the field. This is the knowledge of those who know. 2 I am the Knower of the field in everyone, Arjuna. Knowledge of the field and its Knower is true knowledge. 1  Listen and I will explain the nature of the field and how change takes place within it. I will also describe the Knower of the field and his power. 4 These truths have been sung by great sages in a variety of ways, and expounded in precise arguments concerning Brahman. 3  The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy from which all these evolved. 6 In this field arise desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the body, intelligence, and will. 5  Those who know truly are free from pride and deceit. They are gentle, forgiving, upright, and pure, devoted to their spiritual teacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled. 8 Detached from sense objects and self-will, they have learned the painful lesson of separate birth and suffering, old age, disease, and death. 7  Free from selfish attachment, they do not get compulsively entangled even in home and family. They are even-minded through good fortune and bad. 10 Their devotion to me is undivided. Enjoying solitude and not following the crowd, they seek only me. 9  \fThis is true knowledge, to seek the Self as the true end of wisdom always. To seek anything else is ignorance. 11  I will tell you of the wisdom that leads to immortality: the beginningless Brahman, which can be called neither being nor nonbeing. 12  It dwells in all, in every hand and foot and head, in every mouth and eye and ear in the universe. 14 Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. 13  It is both near and far, both within and without every creature; it moves and is unmoving. 16 In its subtlety it is beyond comprehension. It is indivisible, yet appears divided in separate creatures. Know it to be the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. 15  Dwelling in every heart, it is beyond darkness. It is called the light of light, the object and goal of knowledge, and knowledge itself. 17  I have revealed to you the nature of the field and the meaning and object of true knowledge. Those who are devoted to me, knowing these things, are united with me. 18  Know that prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning, and that from prakriti come the gunas and all that changes. 20 Prakriti is the agent, cause, and effect of every action, but it is Purusha that seems to experience pleasure and pain. 19  Purusha, resting in prakriti, witnesses the play of the gunas born of prakriti. But attachment to the gunas leads a person to be born for good or evil. 21  Within the body the supreme Purusha is called the witness, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the supreme Lord, the highest Self. 22  \fWhoever realizes the true nature of Purusha, prakriti, and the gunas, whatever path he or she may follow, is not born separate again. 23  Some realize the Self within them through the practice of meditation, some by the path of wisdom, and others by selfless service. 25 Others may not know these paths; but hearing and following the instructions of an illumined teacher, they too go beyond death. 24  Whatever exists, Arjuna, animate or inanimate, is born through the union of the field and its Knower. 26  They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. 28 Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. 27  They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved. 30 When they see the variety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they attain fulfillment in Brahman. 29  This supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is touched by action. 32 As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every creature. 31  As the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the source of all light in the field. 34 Those who, with the eye of wisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to freedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal. 33  \fChapter_fourteen  The Forces of Evolution The last chapter gave us the distinction between Purusha and prakriti. This chapter will tell us in more detail about the nature of prakriti  the basis of the world of mind and matter. Here the Gita explains human experience in terms of the three qualities of prakriti, known as gunas: sattva, rajas, and tamas. When the soul attains illumination it goes beyond the confines of prakriti into the spiritual realm of Purusha. But until then, the soul must learn to deal with these three all-powerful forces. No single English word can be given to translate the words sattva, rajas, and tamas. The quality of sattva combines goodness, purity, light, harmony, balance. In terms of evolution, sattva is on the highest level. Rajas is energy  or, on the human level, passion  which can be both good and bad. In personality rajas may express itself in anger, hatred, or greed; but it also provides motivation, the will to act. Rajas is ambitious, which is not altogether a bad thing for the evolution of the soul. It is definitely superior to the third guna, tamas, which combines inertia, sloth, darkness, ignorance, insensitivity. This is the lowest state in terms of evolution; for tamas means a dead stability, where nothing much happens for good or ill. Worse, tamas can mean not just stability but a sliding backwards in the struggle of evolution, where to stand still may mean to be left behind (14:18). In any given personality or phenomenon all the three gunas are likely to be present. It is the mix of the three that colors our experience. Sattva may be dominant, with an admixture of rajas or tamas. Or perhaps rajas dominates, with a little sattva and a good measure of tamas. Finally, the personality may be basically tamasic, with a few rays of the light of sattva and a little of the heat of rajas. In any case, no mix of the three gunas is stable, for it is the very nature of prakriti to be in constant flux. The gunas are constantly shifting, always changing in intensity. It is essential that the gunas, even the purity and goodness of sattva, be transcended if the soul is to attain its final release. For the three gunas are forces that operate within the world of prakriti: in fact, their three strands make up the whole fabric of the phenomenal world. Liberation lies beyond the conditioning of prakriti, in the realm of Purusha. When Arjuna asks  \fKrishna to describe the person who has gone beyond prakritis net, Krishna replies that such a person is detached from the constant shifting and interaction of the gunas. Identified with the Self, he or she realizes that the gunas and their play are external  even the emotions and thoughts that seem so personal, so interior, are really only the play of prakriti. Thoughts and emotions, and ahamkara itself, stop at the gate of the inner Self. The Self abides in the inner chamber of the heart, always at peace, whatever forces of prakriti may storm outside. The illumined man or woman maintains a joyful evenness of mind in happiness and sorrow. At the end of the chapter, again reminding him of the power of devotion (bhakti), Krishna says that Arjuna can transcend the gunas through steadfast love. If he has devotion and has gone beyond the three gunas, then he will be fit to know Brahman.   \f14: Forces of Evolution KRISHNA  Let me tell you more about the wisdom that transcends all knowledge, through which the saints and sages attained perfection. 2 Those who rely on this wisdom will be united with me. For them there is neither rebirth nor fear of death. 1  My womb is prakriti; in that I place the seed. Thus all created things are born. 4 Everything born, Arjuna, comes from the womb of prakriti, and I am the seed-giving father. 3  It is the three gunas born of prakriti  sattva, rajas, and tamas  that bind the immortal Self to the body. 6 Sattva  pure, luminous, and free from sorrow  binds us with attachment to happiness and wisdom. 7 Rajas is passion, arising from selfish desire and attachment. These bind the Self with compulsive action. 8 Tamas, born of ignorance, deludes all creatures through heedlessness, indolence, and sleep. 5  Sattva binds us to happiness; rajas binds us to action. Tamas, distorting our understanding, binds us to delusion. 9  Sattva predominates when rajas and tamas are transformed. Rajas prevails when sattva is weak and tamas overcome. Tamas prevails when rajas and sattva are dormant. 10  When sattva predominates, the light of wisdom shines through every gate of the body. 12 When rajas predominates, a person runs about pursuing selfish and greedy ends, driven by restlessness and 11  \fdesire. 13 When tamas is dominant a person lives in darkness  slothful, confused, and easily infatuated. Those dying in the state of sattva attain the pure worlds of the wise. 15 Those dying in rajas are reborn among people driven by work. But those who die in tamas are conceived in the wombs of the ignorant. 14  The fruit of good deeds is pure and sattvic. The fruit of rajas is suffering. The fruit of tamas is ignorance and insensitivity. 16  From sattva comes understanding; from rajas, greed. But the outcome of tamas is confusion, infatuation, and ignorance. 17  Those who live in sattva go upwards; those in rajas remain where they are. But those immersed in tamas sink downwards. 18  The wise see clearly that all action is the work of the gunas. Knowing that which is above the gunas, they enter into union with me. 19  Going beyond the three gunas which form the body, they leave behind the cycle of birth and death, decrepitude and sorrow, and attain to immortality. 20  ARJUNA  What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the gunas, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the gunas hold? 21  KRISHNA  They are unmoved by the harmony of sattva, the activity of rajas, or the delusion of tamas. They feel no aversion when these forces are active, nor do they crave for them when these forces subside. 22  They remain impartial, undisturbed by the actions of the gunas. Knowing that it is the gunas which act, they abide within 23  \fthemselves and do not vacillate. Established within themselves, they are equal in pleasure and pain, praise and blame, kindness and unkindness. Clay, a rock, and gold are the same to them. 25 Alike in honor and dishonor, alike to friend and foe, they have given up every selfish pursuit. Such are those who have gone beyond the gunas. 24  By serving me with steadfast love, a man or woman goes beyond the gunas. Such a one is fit for union with Brahman. 27 For I am the support of Brahman, the eternal, the unchanging, the deathless, the everlasting dharma, the source of all joy. 26  \fChapter_fifteen  The Supreme Self This is a difficult chapter, for it deals essentially with questions of theology and ultimate mystical experience. Krishna reveals that he transcends not only the world of matter but also the immortal Atman that dwells as the conscious knower within all beings. Krishna has said that he is the Atman; but the paradox is that he also transcends the Atman. In this highest aspect Krishna is Ishvara, the cosmic Lord, who abides in his own mystery. The liberated Self enjoys union with Krishna and lives in Krishnas highest home. But the Self does not become Krishna: the immortal soul, even when liberated from its mortal journeying, does not become God. The chapter opens with the image of an upside-down tree, a world-tree rooted in Brahman which branches out into a manifold creation in this realm below. This is said to be an ashvattha or pipal tree, a kind of fig. Like the banyan, it sends out roots into the air, spreading above and below. In this chapter about Krishnas most exalted nature, it is appropriate that his home, the highest goal of all, is described. It is an abode of light and eternal life. By its very nature, it is beyond the description of human language. Verse 4 uses an elemental and ancient word for the ultimate reality that defies all description, all human thought: Tat, which means simply that or it. Here the Gita personalizes Tat to the extent of giving It a home: avyayam padam, the immortal home, the eternal goal. Pada also means foot or step, and it is of interest here to recall a myth from the Vedas. At the beginning of time Vishnu took three steps that measured out the entire cosmos. The third and highest step became a heavenly world, the realm of the blessed. In the Rig Veda (I.154.5), the poet longs to find himself in this home of the god: May I go to his blessed world Where those who love the gods rejoice; For there, truly, is the company of the far-stepping god, A fountain of honey in the highest step of Vishnu.  \fThe Gita describes Krishnas home as a realm of light beyond the light of the sun (15:6). Here we might compare the Gita with the Katha Upanishad (5:15): There shines not the sun, neither moon nor star, Nor flash of lightning, nor fire lit on earth. The Self is the light reflected by all. He shining, everything shines after him. Even here, though, we are reminded that Krishna lives not just in this highest realm but also in the world below, where both darkness and light coexist. In his divine mystery he sends fragments of himself to become the inner Self in each creature. In this sense the Self enters the body at conception, dwells in the body, and then departs at death. Krishna is the prana  the breath or vitality  of the body. The Upanishads speak of five pranas; here the Gita mentions the two most prominent: the prana by which we breathe and the prana that digests food.   \f15: The Supreme Self KRISHNA  Sages speak of the immutable ashvattha tree, with its taproot above and its branches below. On this tree grow the scriptures; seeing their source, one knows their essence. 1  Nourished by the gunas, the limbs of this tree spread above and below. Sense objects grow on the limbs as buds; the roots hanging down bind us to action in this world. 2  The true form of this tree  its essence, beginning, and end  is not perceived on this earth. Cut down this strong-rooted tree with the sharp ax of detachment; 4 then find the path which does not come back again. Seek That, the First Cause, from which the universe came long ago. 3  Not deluded by pride, free from selfish attachment and selfish desire, beyond the duality of pleasure and pain, ever aware of the Self, the wise go forward to that eternal goal. 6 Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire can add to that light. This is my supreme abode, and those who enter there do not return to separate existence. 5  An eternal part of me enters into the world, assuming the powers of action and perception and a mind made of prakriti. 8 When the divine Self enters and leaves a body, it takes these along as the wind carries a scent from place to place. 9 Using the mind, ears, eyes, nose, and the senses of taste and touch, the Self enjoys sense objects. 7  \fThe deluded do not see the Self when it leaves the body or when it dwells within it. They do not see the Self enjoying sense objects or acting through the gunas. But they who have the eye of wisdom see. 10  Those who strive resolutely on the path of yoga see the Self within. The thoughtless, who strive imperfectly, do not. 11  The brightness of the sun, which lights up the world, the brightness of the moon and of fire  these are my glory. 13 With a drop of my energy I enter the earth and support all creatures. Through the moon, the vessel of life-giving fluid, I nourish all plants. 14 I enter breathing creatures and dwell within as the lifegiving breath. I am the fire in the stomach which digests all food. 12  Entering into every heart, I give the power to remember and understand; it is I again who take that power away. All the scriptures lead to me; I am their author and their wisdom. 15  In this world there are two orders of being: the perishable, separate creature and the changeless spirit. 17 But beyond these there is another, the supreme Self, the eternal Lord, who enters into the entire cosmos and supports it from within. 16  I am that supreme Self, praised by the scriptures as beyond the changing and the changeless. 19 Those who see in me that supreme Self see truly. They have found the source of all wisdom, Arjuna, and they worship me with all their heart. 18  I have shared this profound truth with you, Arjuna. Those who understand it will attain wisdom; they will have done that which has to be done. 20  \fChapter_sixteen  Two Paths In this most unusual chapter, the Gita departs from a lofty view of human nature and describes two opposing forces. The higher tendency, the divine, leads to increasing happiness in the course of the souls evolution, and eventually to its liberation; but there is also a downward current leading to suffering and enslavement of the spirit. This chapter is unusual in giving equal, if not in fact more, attention to this dark side of human nature. Here we get a detailed description of the divine qualities that liberate and the demonic qualities that enslave (16:5). In a rare somber tone, Krishna describes the sinful person, the individual of a demonic kind  and it seems he knows what he is talking about. But first he assures Arjuna that he is of the divine type, so he shouldnt be alarmed. The demonic personality is basically atheistic. For such people life does not originate in God or a divine reality but is grounded in biology, in sexual desire. Taking a low view of human nature, such people cause suffering to themselves as well as others. They are arrogant and have many insatiable selfish desires, and they do not hesitate to do anything that will get them what they want. Krishna grants that they may attain their desires, enjoying wealth and power, but their destination is hell  a hell of their own making, often in this very life, as their karma bears fruit. One of the least likable characteristics of demonic personalities is their sense of self-importance. They like to give gifts ostentatiously and offer ritual sacrifices; this legitimizes their wealth and makes them feel respectable and esteemed. They like being generous if it will make them look good. Krishna does not disguise his aversion to cruel people. He tells Arjuna that he arranges for them to be born again and again in a harsh world. Such souls cannot seem to purify their sinful hearts; repeating the same selfish ways, they sink lower and lower. This is a bleak picture, which the Gita dwells on only in this chapter. But even here, amidst the gloom, Krishna will not say that such a soul is eternally damned. It may be that such a sinful creature is condemned to birth after birth in harsh, unfavorable  \fcircumstances, sinking into more and more hellish states of mind; but the cycle goes on, the choice to change direction is always open, and the Atman itself can never be stained. Lust, anger, and greed are the three doors to hell that Arjuna must at all costs not enter. The person who enters will not only fail to reach lifes final goal, but will not achieve any measure of lasting happiness and prosperity. In Sanskrit this chapter is called the Way of Divine and Demonic Destinies. The words deva, god, and asura, demon, are not to be taken too literally here. The Hindu scriptures often tell stories of the battles between the gods and the demons; thus they dramatize the struggle between good and evil in the world. No divine character from Hindu myth escapes a challenge from some demon. Usually the god or goddess is victorious; but often the demon will win a battle or two, though not the final victory. Krishna has a long battle record, celebrated by epithets like Madhusudana, slayer of the demon Madhu. Rama, another incarnation of Vishnu, had to confront and kill Ravana. The stories go on. The gods never seem to rest for long: there is always a new challenge to their authority, a new source of malignant evil to be destroyed. The Mahabharata and the Gita do not dwell on these mythical battles. Here the interest is more frankly human, and when Krishna discusses the divine and demonic qualities, he speaks not of gods and demons but of human good and evil.   \f16: Two Paths KRISHNA  Be fearless and pure; never waver in your determination or your dedication to the spiritual life. Give freely. Be self-controlled, sincere, truthful, loving, and full of the desire to serve. Realize the truth of the scriptures; learn to be detached and to take joy in renunciation. 2 Do not get angry or harm any living creature, but be compassionate and gentle; show good will to all. 3 Cultivate vigor, patience, will, purity; avoid malice and pride. Then, Arjuna, you will achieve your divine destiny. 1  Other qualities, Arjuna, make a person more and more inhuman: hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty, ignorance. 4  The divine qualities lead to freedom; the demonic, to bondage. But do not grieve, Arjuna; you were born with divine attributes. 5  Some people have divine tendencies, others demonic. I have described the divine at length, Arjuna; now listen while I describe the demonic. 6  The demonic do things they should avoid and avoid the things they should do. They have no sense of uprightness, purity, or truth. 7  There is no God, they say, no truth, no spiritual law, no moral order. The basis of life is sex; what else can it be? 9 Holding such distorted views, possessing scant discrimination, they become enemies of the world, causing suffering and destruction. 8  \fHypocritical, proud, and arrogant, living in delusion and clinging to deluded ideas, insatiable in their desires, they pursue their unclean ends. 11 Although burdened with fears that end only with death, they still maintain with complete assurance, Gratification of lust is the highest that life can offer. 10  Bound on all sides by scheming and anxiety, driven by anger and greed, they amass by any means they can a hoard of money for the satisfaction of their cravings. 12  I got this today, they say; tomorrow I shall get that. This wealth is mine, and that will be mine too. 14 I have destroyed my enemies. I shall destroy others too! Am I not like God? I enjoy what I want. I am successful. I am powerful. I am happy. 15 I am rich and well-born. Who is equal to me? I will perform sacrifices and give gifts, and rejoice in my own generosity. This is how they go on, deluded by ignorance. 16 Bound by their greed and entangled in a web of delusion, whirled about by a fragmented mind, they fall into a dark hell. 13  Self-important, obstinate, swept away by the pride of wealth, they ostentatiously perform sacrifices without any regard for their purpose. 18 Egotistical, violent, arrogant, lustful, angry, envious of everyone, they abuse my presence within their own bodies and in the bodies of others. 17  Life after life I cast those who are malicious, hateful, cruel, and degraded into the wombs of those with similar demonic natures. 20 Birth after birth they find themselves with demonic tendencies. Degraded in this way, Arjuna, they fail to reach me and fall lower still. 19  There are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and greed. Renounce these three. 22 Those who escape from these three gates of darkness, Arjuna, seek what is best and attain lifes supreme goal. 23 Others disregard the teachings of the scriptures. Driven by selfish desire, they miss the goal of life, miss even happiness and success. 21  \fTherefore let the scriptures be your guide in what to do and what not to do. Understand their teachings; then act in accordance with them. 24  \fChapter_seventeen  The Power of Faith At the end of the last chapter, Krishna told Arjuna to look to the scriptures to guide his actions, so that he can avoid the lower road that leads backwards to a less evolved state. Now Arjuna wants to know about those who do not follow the orthodox way set down in the scriptures, but who nevertheless offer some kind of worship with faith in their hearts. In reply Krishna goes into greater detail about the three gunas  sattva, rajas, and tamas. He also stresses the importance of shraddha or faith. This is a difficult word. Faith is not an adequate translation, and the etymology of the word is obscure; it probably has an underlying meaning of what is held in the heart. We might say that our shraddha is the sum total of our values, what we really hold to be important in our lives. Every human being, Krishna says, is shraddhamaya,made up of faith  as the Bible puts it, as we think in our heart, so we are. Here, as elsewhere in the Gita, shraddha is a positive quality. It is good to have faith; yet faith can be of different kinds, different qualities. Sattvic faith is the most evolved, the most pure. Rajasic faith is dynamic, evolving, yet tainted with selfish motives. Tamasic faith goes astray in a spiritual desert. To illustrate this, Krishna tells Arjuna that sattvic people worship the devas  the gods of heaven, of light. The rajasic worship yakshas and rakshasas. The yakshas are servants of the god of wealth; rakshasas are powerful, fearsome spirits driven by the lust for power and pleasure. Finally, tamasic people worship the spirits of the dead and ghosts. In a practical digression, Krishna describes the different kinds of food liked by the sattvic, the rajasic, and the tamasic. Then he applies the three gunas to the act of worship and sacrifice or selfless service (yajna). Verses 1416 turn to the important question of tapas or sadhana, the disciplines undergone for the sake of spiritual growth. The Gita holds that no lasting progress is possible on the spiritual path without self-discipline. The root of the word tapas is tap, to be hot or to suffer pain; and in fact tapas can also mean heat or suffering. When certain spiritual practices are mastered, they create a feeling of heat in the body, which is a sign of  \fincreased spiritual potency. Tapas also refers to the power gained through spiritual austerity. Krishna dispels the mistaken belief that tapas means mortifying or torturing the body, and points out that spiritual disciplines can be sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. The sattvic kind of tapas is offered for a truly spiritual goal; rajasic tapas is performed to gain a selfish end, probably the admiration of others. Deluded by tamas, a person will undergo painful, foolish practices to try to gain power over, or even to injure, others. Changing course for a moment, Krishna discusses the mantram Om Tat Sat. Om is the most ancient of Hindu mantrams; it is the sacred syllable that is Brahman, the cosmic sound heard in the depths of meditation. Tat is That, the supreme reality beyond what language can describe or thought can think. And sat means both that which is and that which is good. The mantram Om Tat Sat affirms that only the good really exists; the opposite word, asat, implies that evil is transient and therefore is not ultimately real. The last verse concludes that no act or intention can add to spiritual growth if it is faithless. An act done without shraddha is asat, unreal; it cannot have meaning either in this world or the next.   \f17: The Power of Faith ARJUNA  O Krishna, what is the state of those who disregard the scriptures but still worship with faith? Do they act from sattva, rajas, or tamas? 1  KRISHNA  Every creature is born with faith of some kind, either sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. Listen, and I will describe each to you. 2  Our faith conforms to our nature, Arjuna. Human nature is made of faith. A person is what his shraddha is. 3  Those who are sattvic worship the forms of God; those who are rajasic worship power and wealth. Those who are tamasic worship spirits and ghosts. 5 Some invent harsh penances. Motivated by hypocrisy and egotism, 6 they torture their innocent bodies and me who dwells within. Blinded by their strength and passion, they act and think like demons. 4  The three kinds of faith express themselves in the habits of those who hold them: in the food they like, the work they do, the disciplines they practice, the gifts they give. Listen, and I will describe their different ways. 7  Sattvic people enjoy food that is mild, tasty, substantial, agreeable, and nourishing, food that promotes health, strength, cheerfulness, and longevity. 9 Rajasic people like food that is salty or bitter, hot, sour, or spicy  food that promotes pain, discomfort, and disease. 10 8  \fTamasic people like overcooked, stale, leftover, and impure food, food that has lost its taste and nutritional value. The sattvic perform sacrifices with their entire mind fixed on the purpose of the sacrifice. Without thought of reward, they follow the teachings of the scriptures. 12 The rajasic perform sacrifices for the sake of show and the good it will bring them. 13 The tamasic perform sacrifices ignoring both the letter and the spirit. They omit the proper prayers, the proper offerings, the proper food, and the proper faith. 11  To offer service to the gods, to the good, to the wise, and to your spiritual teacher; purity, honesty, continence, and nonviolence: these are the disciplines of the body. 15 To offer soothing words, to speak truly, kindly, and helpfully, and to study the scriptures: these are the disciplines of speech. 16 Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind. 14  When these three levels of self-discipline are practiced without attachment to the results, but in a spirit of great faith, the sages call this practice sattvic. 18 Disciplines practiced in order to gain respect, honor, or admiration are rajasic; they are undependable and transitory in their effects. 19 Disciplines practiced to gain power over others, or in the confused belief that to torture oneself is spiritual, are tamasic. 17  Giving simply because it is right to give, without thought of return, at a proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy person, is sattvic giving. 21 Giving with regrets or in the expectation of receiving some favor or of getting something in return is rajasic. 22 Giving at an inappropriate time, in inappropriate circumstances, and to an unworthy person, without affection or respect, is tamasic. 20  Om Tat Sat: these three words represent Brahman, from which come priests and scriptures and sacrifice. 24 Those who follow the Vedas, therefore, always repeat the word Om when offering sacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, or giving gifts. 25 Those seeking liberation and not any personal benefit add the word Tat 23  \fwhen performing these acts of worship, discipline, and charity. 26 Sat means that which is; it also indicates goodness. Therefore it is used to describe a worthy deed. To be steadfast in self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving is sat. To act in accordance with these three is sat as well. 28 But to engage in sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving without good faith is asat, without worth or goodness, either in this life or in the next. 27  \fChapter_eighteen  Freedom & Renunciation This final chapter of the Gita roams over many subjects, beginning with a discussion of the merits of renunciation versus the life of personally involved action. To begin with, Arjuna asks about two words commonly used for renunciation in Sanskrit, sannyasa and tyaga. Both words come from roots meaning to give up or abandon. Sannyasa acquired the specialized meaning of giving up ordinary life to live the austere, wandering life of a homeless pilgrim. A sannyasi is a monk: one who does not participate in family life and has withdrawn from society. In a sense, he has withdrawn from life. Krishna does not recommend this kind of renunciation. In fact, he says it is impossible for anyone to give up in this way, for as long as we have a body, we have to do a certain amount of work just to maintain it. Krishna does not advise dropping out of life, and the Gita is primarily aimed at people who live in the world yet desire genuine spiritual fulfillment. The kind of renunciation Krishna recommends is tyaga, where it is not activity but selfish desire for the rewards of action  of work, of life  that is to be renounced. Arjuna is advised to fulfill all his responsibilities, but without a selfish motive. In particular, he should not give up the three great virtuous works  sacrifice, giving, and spiritual disciplines. Having made plain to Arjuna that renunciation is essential, Krishna goes on to explain that renunciation can be of three kinds, depending upon the guna that dominates the individuals personality. As may be expected, rajasic and tamasic renunciation leave something to be desired. Many times Krishna has said that renunciation of the fruits of work is essential. Perhaps the verse in chapter 2 said it best  that we have control over our work and actions, but we have no command of the results. The word karma-phala-tyaga appears again and again, and the literal translation is renunciation of the fruits of action. In this final chapter, literally The Freedom [moksha] That Comes from Renunciation, Krishna sums up his teaching that in work, in life, one must not be driven by a selfish desire for any kind of reward, for such compulsive work can only stunt full spiritual development. In addition, Krishna points out, when we act out of selfish  \fattachment, we must fully partake of the result, the karma, of every thought, word, and deed; and although these results may be what was desired, they may also be something not desired at all, or a little of both (18:12). In this life we can never be sure that things will turn out as planned. In verse 13 the Sankhya philosophy is again mentioned. Scholars believe that at the time the Gita was composed the Sankhya school was at an early stage of development, yet even here we see the characteristic method of thorough categorizing. Using the Sankhya categories of the three gunas, the Gita goes on to give more detail about work, which is of three kinds  sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic. Similarly, the doer of the work is shown to be dominated by one of these all-pervasive qualities. In a very interesting passage Krishna talks of three kinds of happiness  a practical application of the abstract theories of Sankhya (18:3639). Pursuing the world of work, and how it contributes to spiritual growth, the Gita gives a short explanation of caste in this chapter. The Gita is not especially interested in caste  the social hierarchy of Hindu society  but we do find a short explanation here. The sannyasi, the renouncing monk, has left society and therefore belongs to no caste, but Krishna does not point out that course to Arjuna. Rather, he wants Arjuna to lead an active life. Krishna tells him that devotion to his own duty is best. It is better to do ones own work, even if imperfectly, than to try to take on some other work. The work proper to each of the four castes is then described. In general, the Gita takes a liberal view of caste, and it would be wrong to interpret this chapter as supporting a rigid caste system. The final part of this chapter, verses 50 and following, give a picture of the person who has attained siddhi success or perfection  in the spiritual life and who goes on to union with Brahman. In verse 61 Krishna returns to a favorite topic  the Lord dwelling in the hearts of all beings. But here he adds a startling revelation: the Lord dwells in all, yet he whirls them around through maya as if they were toys mounted on a machine. Having jarred Arjuna with this amazing image, Krishna reassures him that he can escape from the machine, the wheel of time, through devotion to God. If he wholeheartedly takes refuge in the Lord within, then through Krishnas grace he will find peace. As his all but final word, Krishna reminds Arjuna that he holds him very dear. Through devotion, Arjuna will be able to find his way, and he should not forget that Krishna feels deep love for him.  \fThe relationship between the teacher and student is given a parting word, partially of warning. Krishna does not want these profound truths told to anyone who is not ready. Anyone lacking devotion or self-control, who does not want to hear spiritual instruction or who scoffs at it, should not be accepted as a student. The sacred act of giving spiritual instruction cannot be undertaken lightly. It is the highest work, and the man or woman who does it is most dear to Krishna. Finally, Krishna asks Arjuna if he has understood. Arjuna says yes, his conflicts are over; he is ready to follow Krishnas instructions. This concludes the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna and the instruction of the Gita proper. Sanjaya, who has been narrating the poem to blind king Dhritarashtra, adds a few final verses of benediction. He has seen this dialogue through his mystic vision, granted by the grace of Vyasa. Just recalling this wonderful conversation makes his hair stand on end in ecstasy, and when he remembers Krishnas wonderful beauty, his joy is boundless.   \f18: Freedom & Renunciation ARJUNA  O Krishna, destroyer of evil, please explain to me sannyasa and tyaga and how one kind of renunciation differs from another. 1  KRISHNA  To refrain from selfish acts is one kind of renunciation, called sannyasa; to renounce the fruit of action is another, called tyaga. 2  Among the wise, some say that all action should be renounced as evil. Others say that certain kinds of action  self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline  should be continued. 4 Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain three kinds of tyaga and my conclusions concerning them. 3  Self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline should not be renounced, for they purify the thoughtful. 6 Yet even these, Arjuna, should be performed without desire for selfish rewards. This is essential. 5  To renounce ones responsibilities is not fitting. The wise call such deluded renunciation tamasic. 8 To avoid action from fear of difficulty or physical discomfort is rajasic. There is no reward in such renunciation. 9 But to fulfill your responsibilities knowing that they are obligatory, while at the same time desiring nothing for yourself  this is sattvic renunciation. 10 Those endowed with sattva clearly understand the meaning of renunciation and do not waver. They are not intimidated by unpleasant work, nor do they seek a job because it is pleasant. 7  \fAs long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward. 12 Those who are attached to personal reward will reap the consequences of their actions: some pleasant, some unpleasant, some mixed. But those who renounce every desire for personal reward go beyond the reach of karma. 11  Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain the five elements necessary for the accomplishment of every action, as taught by the wisdom of Sankhya. 14 The body, the means, the ego, the performance of the act, and the divine will: 15 these are the five factors in all actions, right or wrong, in thought, word, or deed. 13  Those who do not understand this think of themselves as separate agents. With their crude intellects they fail to see the truth. 17 The person who is free from ego, who has attained purity of heart, though he slays these people, he does not slay and is not bound by his action. 16  Knowledge, the thing to be known, and the knower: these three promote action. The means, the act itself, and the doer: these three are the totality of action. 19 Knowledge, action, and the doer can be described according to the gunas. Listen, and I will explain their distinctions to you. 18  Sattvic knowledge sees the one indestructible Being in all beings, the unity underlying the multiplicity of creation. 21 Rajasic knowledge sees all things and creatures as separate and distinct. 22 Tamasic knowledge, lacking any sense of perspective, sees one small part and mistakes it for the whole. 20  Work performed to fulfill ones obligations, without thought of personal reward or of whether the job is pleasant or unpleasant, is sattvic. 24 Work prompted by selfish desire or self-will, full of stress, is rajasic. 25 Work that is undertaken blindly, without any consideration of consequences, waste, injury to others, or ones own capacities, is tamasic. 23  \fSattvic workers are free from egotism and selfish attachments, full of enthusiasm and fortitude in success and failure alike. 27 Rajasic workers have strong personal desires and crave rewards for their actions. Covetous, impure, and destructive, they are easily swept away by fortune, good or bad. 28 Tamasic workers are undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, dishonest, and lazy. They are easily depressed and prone to procrastination. 26  Listen, Arjuna, as I describe the three types of understanding and will. 29  To know when to act and when to refrain from action, what is right action and what is wrong, what brings security and what insecurity, what brings freedom and what bondage: these are the signs of a sattvic intellect. 30  The rajasic intellect confuses right and wrong actions, and cannot distinguish what is to be done from what should not be done. 32 The tamasic intellect is shrouded in darkness, utterly reversing right and wrong wherever it turns. 31  The sattvic will, developed through meditation, keeps prana, mind, and senses in vital harmony. 34 The rajasic will, conditioned by selfish desire, pursues wealth, pleasure, and respectability. 35 The tamasic will shows itself in obstinate ignorance, sloth, fear, grief, depression, and conceit. 33  Now listen, Arjuna: there are also three kinds of happiness. By sustained effort, one comes to the end of sorrow. 37 That which seems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end  this is the joy of sattva, born of a mind at peace with itself. 38 Pleasure from the senses seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter as poison in the end. This is the kind of happiness that comes to the rajasic. 39 Those who are tamasic draw their pleasures from sleep, indolence, and intoxication. Both in the beginning and in the end, this happiness is a delusion. 36  \fNo creature, whether born on earth or among the gods in heaven, is free from the conditioning of the three gunas. 41 The different responsibilities found in the social order  distinguishing brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra  have their roots in this conditioning. 40  The responsibilities to which brahmins are born, based on their nature, are self-control, tranquility, purity of heart, patience, humility, learning, austerity, wisdom, and faith. 42  The qualities of kshatriyas, based on their nature, are courage, strength, fortitude, dexterity, generosity, leadership, and the firm resolve never to retreat from battle. 44 The occupations suitable for a vaishya are agriculture, dairying, and trade. The proper work of a shudra is service. 43  By devotion to ones own particular duty, everyone can attain perfection. Let me tell you how. 46 By performing ones own work, one worships the Creator who dwells in every creature. Such worship brings that person to fulfillment. 45  It is better to perform ones own duties imperfectly than to master the duties of another. By fulfilling the obligations he is born with, a person never comes to grief. 48 No one should abandon duties because he sees defects in them. Every action, every activity, is surrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke. 47  One who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action. 50 Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom. 49  Unerring in discrimination, sovereign of the senses and passions, free from the clamor of likes and dislikes, 52 such a one leads a simple, self-reliant life based on meditation, controlling speech, body, and mind. 51  \fFree from self-will, aggressiveness, arrogance, anger, and the lust to possess people or things, they are at peace with themselves and others and enter into the unitive state. 54 United with Brahman, ever joyful, beyond the reach of desire and sorrow, they have equal regard for every living creature and attain supreme devotion to me. 55 By loving me they come to know me truly; then they know my glory and enter into my boundless being. 56 All their acts are performed in my service, and through my grace they win eternal life. 53  Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always. 58 Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. 57  If you egotistically say, I will not fight this battle, your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. 60 Your own karma, born of your own nature, will drive you to do even that which you do not wish to do, because of your delusion. 59  The Lord dwells in the hearts of all creatures and whirls them round upon the wheel of maya. 62 Run to him for refuge with all your strength, and peace profound will be yours through his grace. 61  I give you these precious words of wisdom; reflect on them and then do as you choose. 64 These are the last words I shall speak to you, dear one, for your spiritual fulfillment. You are very dear to me. 63  Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me. 66 Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve. 65  Do not share this wisdom with anyone who lacks in devotion or self-control, lacks the desire to learn, or scoffs at me. 68 Those who teach this supreme mystery of the Gita to all who love me perform 67  \fthe greatest act of love; they will come to me without doubt. 69 No one can render me more devoted service; no one on earth can be more dear to me. Those who meditate on these holy words worship me with wisdom and devotion. 71 Even those who listen to them with faith, free from doubts, will find a happier world where good people dwell. 70  Have you listened with attention? Are you now free from your doubts and confusion? 72  ARJUNA  You have dispelled my doubts and delusions, and I understand through your grace. My faith is firm now, and I will do your will. 73  SANJAYA  This is the dialogue I heard between Krishna, the son of Vasudeva, and Arjuna, the great-hearted son of Pritha. The wonder of it makes my hair stand on end! 75 Through Vyasas grace, I have heard the supreme secret of spiritual union directly from the Lord of Yoga, Krishna himself. 74  Whenever I remember these wonderful, holy words between Krishna and Arjuna, I am filled with joy. 77 And when I remember the breathtaking form of Krishna, I am filled with wonder and my joy overflows. 76  Wherever the divine Krishna and the mighty Arjuna are, there will be prosperity, victory, happiness, and sound judgment. Of this I am sure! 78  \fNotes CHAPTER ONE  1 The phrase on the field of dharma (dharma-kshetre) gives a hint that the battle is to be an allegorical one, a fight of dharma, justice, against adharma, evil. The battle takes place not only at Kurukshetra, the field of the Kurus, but also on the elusive field of dharma, the spiritual realm where all moral struggles are waged. 4044 These verses are particularly difficult to translate, because they revolve around the complex word dharma: law, justice, or simply somethings inner nature. To try to capture the word in English we might say Gods law or eternal truth. Dharma is divinely given; it is the force that holds things together in a unity, the center that must hold if all is to go well. The opposite of dharma is adharma: evil, injustice, chaos. In these verses Arjuna gives expression to his fears of a coming chaos, an evil world where good people will be confused and violated. Sense of unity here translates dharma; the phrase loses its sense of unity would be more literally translated as is overcome by adharma. The translation speaks in a general way of the chaos that overcomes society when dharma is weak  when ancient spiritual truths are ignored. Thus varna-samkara, literally confusion of caste, is more meaningful as society [is] plunged into chaos. The subject here is not the observance of caste restrictions, but the essential cohesion of the social fabric. 42 The Sanskrit refers to the ancient pinda rites that offer homage to dead ancestors. These rites maintained the traditions of the family by respecting and worshipping those who had gone before. Again, the rather liberal rendering the spiritual evolution begun by our ancestors seems preferable to a narrower translation. CHAPTER TWO  \f17 Tat, that, is an ancient name for Brahman, the supreme reality. Brahman is neither masculine nor feminine; in fact, it has no attributes at all. It is impossible to describe Brahman in words, so it is simply pointed to: tat. 72 The state of immortality is brahma-nirvana, the nirvana that is Brahman. This is the state of release or liberation, union with the divine ground of existence. The word nirvana comes from the Sanskrit root va to blow with the prefix nir out; it means to extinguish, as a fire is said to be blown out. Thus it indicates the extinction of the old, limited personality. By adding the word brahman, complete union with the universal Godhead is indicated. Brahma-nirvana then means the mystic state of extinction of self in the union with God. Nirvana is a Buddhist term as well. Some misconceptions are unfortunately current about this rather esoteric concept. Nirvana is wrongly presented as a kind of empty nothingness, even a spiritual death. We get exactly the opposite impression if we approach the Hindus and Buddhists themselves. It is true there is much talk of extinguishing the petty ego and going beyond self-will  the mask that hides the creative, wise, loving Self underneath. This death of the old person to make way for the new is one purpose of spiritual disciplines. It can be painful, but the death of the old does not lead to annihilation but to a spiritual rebirth. CHAPTER THREE  9 Here and later yajna is translated as selfless work or selfless service. The literal meaning is sacrifice: essentially, self-sacrifice, giving up something one greatly values for the sake of a higher purpose. Some translators give a very narrow translation of yajna as a ritualistic sacrifice, but this is inaccurate. 39 Kama can be translated as selfish desire or pleasure, and often carries a connotation of sensual desire or sexual passion. It means essentially a personal desire for ease or pleasure, not desire of a more altruistic kind. CHAPTER FOUR  \f37 This is a well-known verse. The meanings of karma are complex, but the verse is widely taken to mean that true knowledge destroys the effects of past errors, which generate further karma. When consciousness is unified and illumined, one is released from the bondage of karma. CHAPTER FIVE  6 Yoga has many meanings in the Gita. Here yoga is translated as action and selfless service because a contrast is being made between Sankhya and yoga: that is, between philosophical explanation and the actual practice of the spiritual life. 9 The word for senses in Sanskrit is indriya, literally faculty or power. The indriyas are not only the five faculties of perception (seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, and tasting) but also those of action, whose organs are the hands, the feet, the tongue, and the organs of excretion and reproduction. 13 The city of nine gates is the body. The gates are the two eyes, the two nostrils, the two ears, the mouth, and the organs of excretion and reproduction. In some lists these gates are expanded to eleven by adding the navel and the brahmarandhra or sagittal suture, the opening at the top of the skull. 2728 The area of spiritual consciousness between the eyebrows is one of the seven centers of awareness or chakras described in yoga literature. These seven chakras, though not physical, are said to lie along a channel for awakened spiritual energy (kundalini) that corresponds with the spine; the chakras are located at the level of the anus, sex organs, stomach, heart, throat, eyebrows, and the top of the head. Kundalini circulates among these centers, but it is usually confined to the lowest three chakras, corresponding to the main preoccupations of life on the physical level. In yogic concentration the vital energy (kundalini) rises; samadhi is said to take place when it reaches the chakras at the brow or head. CHAPTER SIX  \f11 This describes the traditional seat used for meditation. The Gita is not concerned with the outer forms of the spiritual life, but here we do get a mention of the grass and deerskin used by the ancient sages. Perhaps the point is that they used what was available in their forest retreats, and that the seat should be what Patanjali calls sukhasana: comfortable enough to forget about your body. 14 All actions dedicated to Brahman is a literal translation of the Sanskrit word brahmacharya, a life of self-control and sense restraint. CHAPTER SEVEN  16 Artharthi has given translators some difficulties. Those who desire to achieve their purpose captures the basic meaning of the word. Artha is goal or purpose; the second word of the compound, arthi, means one who has a goal. So artharthi probably refers to those who take to the spiritual life with a particular purpose in view. Artha also means wealth or worldly goods, but to translate this phrase as those who desire wealth would go against the entire tenor of the Gita. 23 The gods here are the devas, the lower, celestial deities such as Indra. 30 These obscure terms (adhibhuta, adhidaiva, and adhiyajna) are taken up in the next chapter. CHAPTER EIGHT  6 Whatever is the content of the mind at the moment of death determines the direction of the souls rebirth. The implication is that whatever has been the bedrock of consciousness during life will be remembered at the time of death and lead the soul on to fulfill that desire in the next life. 910 The eyebrow center is discussed in the note to 5:2728. CHAPTER NINE  5 Yoga here means mysterious power. This is yet another meaning attached to the word yoga, for those who practiced yoga were  \fsometimes thought of as concealing within themselves extraordinary powers developed through their disciplines. The folklore of India relates many stories about mysterious yogis who have strange, divine powers. Krishna speaks here of his yoga aishvaram, his mysterious and majestic power. Ishvara means lord and aishvaram lordly: Krishnas yoga is something he uses as Ishvara, the Lord of the world. Now he begins to show Arjuna something of the nature of the mystery. 17 Rig, Yajur, and Sama are the principal Vedas, the ancient scriptures that are Hinduisms orthodox authority. 2021 These verses repeat the idea that heaven itself is an impermanent state. After exhausting the store of their good karma, the blessed souls in heaven must be reborn on earth. Only the liberated soul, the one who has found union with Krishna or brahmanirvana, escapes the round of rebirth and death as a separate, mortal creature. CHAPTER TEN  This chapter contains many Sanskrit names, which are briefly identified in the glossary (see p. 279). 18 Amrita, immortal, comes from a not and mrita mortal. The Greek word ambrosia is cognate and has the same meanings: amrita is the ambrosia of the gods, the drink that makes them live forever, and in a general sense it means sweet or nectar-like. So the translation could also be your words, which are like ambrosia. 22 The mind (manas) is here taken to be one of the senses or indriyas of perception; for example, it is really with the mind rather than with the eye that we see. 33 The Sanskrit alphabet, too, begins with the letter a; perhaps this is why Krishna declares that among letters he is a, the first. Another possible reason is that a is the most frequent sound in Sanskrit. CHAPTER ELEVEN  \f14 Here Arjuna presses the palms of his hands together in the gesture called anjali, like the Western gesture of prayer. This is the usual form of respectful greeting in India, as well as being used in worship and prayer. 15 Brahma, the Creator (not to be confused with Brahman, the attributeless Godhead, which is beyond the Trinity of creation, preservation, and destruction) sits within a lotus that grows from the navel of Lord Vishnu. 17 Here Arjuna sees not his friend Krishna, but the Lord incarnate in Krishna: Vishnu, armed with his traditional weapons, a club (or mace) and a discus. Not mentioned in this verse are the two benign symbols he carries in his other hands, a conch and a lotus. CHAPTER TWELVE  1 Arjuna is asking which path is superior, that of knowledge (jnana yoga) or love (bhakti yoga). CHAPTER THIRTEEN  5 This is a list of all the twenty-four categories given in Sankhya philosophy to describe phenomena in the field of prakriti. CHAPTER FIFTEEN  1 The ashvattha is the sacred pipal tree, a kind of fig often grown in temple compounds in India. The idea of a world tree appears in many ancient cultures. Here the Gita uses the image of the tree as upside down, drawing on the fact that the pipal sends out aerial roots, making branches above and below. The image illustrates the phenomenal world, rooted in Brahman, complete unity, and branching out into the apparent diversity of life. 13 Rasatmaka soma is here translated as life-giving fluid, the nourishment of plants. In Hindu mythology it is the moon, sometimes called Soma, that nourishes plants, as the source of the life-giving nectar called Soma. In the Vedas, soma is an intoxicating, invigorating  \fdrink distilled from a plant grown high in the mountains and drunk by participants in a sacred ritual. Scholars have tried to discover what the soma plant might have been, but so far no conclusive identification has been made. Soma also appears as an important god in the Vedas. CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  2728 Sat means that which is real or true and that which is good; it derives from the Sanskrit verb as, to be, and is directly related to our English word is. It is noteworthy that this word sat links reality and goodness, reflecting the idea that good is eternal; it is merely covered from time to time by asat, evil, which is temporary and in that sense unreal. Asat is formed from sat by the addition of the prefix a without, very much the way English forms words like amoral. CHAPTER EIGHTEEN  1 Sannyasa and tyaga both mean renunciation, sannyasa from the root as to cast aside and tyaga from tyaj to give up. The distinction between these two is clarified in the introduction to this chapter. 14 The divine will is a translation of daivam, which comes from the word deva, god. Daivam is sometimes translated as fate, but this is inappropriate in the Gita, which is not at all fatalistic. The Gita does, however, allow a place for Gods will or Providence in the affairs of humankind  though of course the dominant force is usually karma, not daivam. 34 This verse uses the phrase dharma-kama-artha, duty, pleasure, and wealth, traditionally considered the three goals of ordinary human life. The fourth and highest goal is moksha, salvation. The rajasic personality, as this verse points out, pursues the first three worldly goals; moksha is ignored. 41 The Vedas establish the fourfold division of society into the classes of brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra  roughly priests and intellectuals; warriors and rulers; businessmen, farmers, and craftsmen; and workers and servants.  \f66 Dharma is not used here in the usual sense of law or inner nature, but in a rarer meaning: a things attribute, condition, or conditioning. Usually dharma is used in this sense only in the plural, as here: thus dharma is divine law; dharmas are the innumerable beings, things, emotions and mental states that make up everyday existence as we experience it. Here, following the root meaning (dhri, to support or hold up), sarvadharman is translated as all your supports, in the sense of external props, conditioned dependencies. Another translation would be: Cast off your dependency on everything external, Arjuna, and rely on the Self alone.  \fGlossary This brief glossary is a guide to Sanskrit terms used in this volume. Words used once and explained in context are not included. As a rough guide, Sanskrit vowels may be pronounced as in Italian or Spanish. The combinations kh, gh, jh, th, dh, ph, and bh are always pronounced as the consonant plus a slight h sound: e.g., ph as in haphazard (not as in phone). Pronounce ch as in church; h as in home; g as in gold; j as in June except in the combination jn, which can be pronounced like gn in Italian compagna. The other consonants are approximately as in English. Every Sanskrit vowel has a short and a long form, the long pronounced for twice as long as the short. The diphthongs  e, ai, o, au  are also long. The Sanskrit alphabet has 48 characters, each representing a precisely defined sound. Scholars represent these characters in our Roman alphabet by adding marks to letters as necessary, creating a system of spelling that is precise but confusing to the general reader. For simplicity, these differentiating marks have been omitted in this e-book, but may be found in the printed edition. adharma Not dharma.

And the reason is clear. It is impossible to get to the heart of those classics unless you live them, and he did live them. My admiration of the man and his works is boundless. Huston Smith, The Worlds Religions Each of these best-selling editions includes a detailed introduction explaining the historical and cultural background and core concepts of the scripture, with a glossary and notes. Other titles in this series:  The Dhammapada This collection of the Buddhas teachings is permeated with all the power and practicality of one of the worlds most appealing spiritual guides. The Upanishads In these most ancient of Indian wisdom texts, illumined sages share flashes of insight, the results of many years of investigation into consciousness  \fitself. THE WISDOM OF INDIA Essence of the Bhagavad Gita A Contemporary Guide to Yoga, Meditation, and Indian Philosophy Inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, Easwaran saw the Gita as not only magnificent literature but a sure guide to human affairs  one that could throw light on the problems I faced in my own times of crisis. This book is Easwarans guide to the Gita, his distillation of its teachings and his answer to the questions: What is the Gita really about? And what is its relevance for us today? Essence of the Bhagavad Gita is a completely new publication based on talks that Easwaran gave to his close students towards the end of his life, after forty years of a teaching career in which he taught, studied, and applied the principles of the Gita with a passionate, contagious enthusiasm. As an ancient scripture, the Gita can be confusing for modern readers, so Easwaran highlights the main themes, explains the key concepts, and shares the verses he loves best, using his own translation from the original Sanskrit. Along the way, he uncovers the Gitas startling insights into the problems threatening our civilization. Like the warrior-prince Arjuna, we must learn to make wise choices. In this modern, original interpretation Easwaran shows how the Gita points a way forward for us  both as individuals and in our global society today. Other titles in this series: Essence of the Upanishads Key to Indian Spirituality (Formerly titled Dialogue with Death) The Katha Upanishad, one of Indias classic wisdom texts, embraces all the key ideas of Indian spirituality within the context of a powerful mythic  \fquest. Set in the shadowy kingdom of Death, the Katha opens with the young hero, Nachiketa, seeking answers to the age-old questions: What is the purpose of life? And what will happen to me after I die? The King of Death emerges as the perfect spiritual guide, challenging, uncompromising, and direct. But the insights of the Katha, as with all the Upanishads, are scattered, hard to understand. Easwaran explains the core concepts and presents them systematically, illustrating them through everyday examples and analogies, as a way to explore deeper and deeper levels of personality. Taken this way, the Katha provides a comprehensive answer to the question Who am I? Essence of the Dhammapada (Forthcoming) ESSENTIAL EASWARAN LIBRARY THE BHAGAVAD GITA FOR DAILY LIVING This detailed commentary on the Bhagavad Gita in three volumes offers a unique combination of wisdom, warmth, and practical spirituality. Easwaran explains each verse, relates it to our modern lives through stories and anecdotes, and suggests small spiritual exercises that we can use to bring the Gitas teachings into our own hearts. These volumes include the Devanagari (Sanskrit) script for each verse followed by Easwarans translation, a passage from the Gita selected and translated for passage meditation, a brief overview of Easwarans eightpoint program of passage meditation, a glossary, a guide to Sanskrit pronunciation, and a detailed index. Volume 1: The End of Sorrow (Chapters 16 of the Bhagavad Gita) Volume 2: Like a Thousand Suns (Chapters 712) Volume 3: To Love Is to Know Me (Chapters 1318)  \fVolume 1 concentrates on the individual: the nature of our innermost Self, how we can discover this Self in the depths of our own consciousness, and how this discovery transforms our daily living. Volume 2 explores the indivisible unity governing all creation. Easwaran describes the steps we can take to realize this unity and to heal divisions within society and ourselves. Volume 3 is global in scope, but Easwarans emphasis is on what we can do as individuals. He explains how our everyday choices, taken all together, lead our society downwards to violence, or upwards to a wiser and more peaceful world. Passage Meditation Bringing the Deep Wisdom of the Heart into Daily Life In Easwarans universal method of passage meditation, you choose a spiritual text from the worlds great traditions that embodies your highest ideals. You memorize it, and then send it deep into consciousness through slow, sustained attention. With regular practice, the passages become lifelines, taking you to the source of wisdom deep within and then guiding you through all the challenges of daily life. Eknath Easwaran taught passage meditation to thousands of people for over forty years, including a course at the University of California.

            "['   \\x0c1: The War Within DHRITARASHTRA  O Sanjaya, tell me what happened at Kurukshetra, the field of dharma, where my family and the Pandavas gathered to fight. 1  SANJAYA  Having surveyed the forces of the Pandavas arrayed for battle, prince Duryodhana approached his teacher, Drona, and spoke. 3 O my teacher, look at this mighty army of the Pandavas, assembled by your own gifted disciple, Yudhishthira. 4 There are heroic warriors and great archers who are the equals of Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana, Virata, the mighty Drupada, 5 Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja,the great leader Shaibya, 6 the powerful Yudhamanyu, the valiant Uttamaujas, and the son of Subhadra, in addition to the sons of Draupadi. All these command mighty chariots. 2  O best of brahmins, listen to the names of those who are distinguished among our own forces: 8 Bhishma, Karna, and the victorious Kripa; Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta. 7  There are many others, too, heroes giving up their lives for my sake, all proficient in war and armed with a variety of weapons. 10 Our army is unlimited and commanded by Bhishma; theirs is small and commanded by Bhima. 11 Let everyone take his proper place and stand firm supporting Bhishma! 9  Then the powerful Bhishma, the grandsire, oldest of all the Kurus, in order to cheer Duryodhana, roared like a lion and blew his 12  \\x0cconch horn. 13 And after Bhishma, a tremendous noise arose of conchs and cow horns and pounding on drums. Then Sri Krishna and Arjuna, who were standing in a mighty chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conchs. 15 Sri Krishna blew the conch named Panchajanya, and Arjuna blew that called Devadatta. The mighty Bhima blew the huge conch Paundra. 16 Yudhishthira, the king, the son of Kunti, blew the conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conchs as well. 17 Then the king of Kashi, the leading bowman, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the invincible Satyaki, 18 Drupada, all the sons of Draupadi, and the strong-armed son of Subhadra joined in, 19 and the noise tore through the heart of Duryodhanas army. Indeed, the sound was tumultuous, echoing throughout heaven and earth. 14  Then, O Dhritarashtra, lord of the earth, having seen your sons forces set in their places and the fighting about to begin, Arjuna spoke these words to Sri Krishna: 20  ARJUNA  O Krishna, drive my chariot between the two armies. 22 I want to see those who desire to fight with me. With whom will this battle be fought? 23 I want to see those assembled to fight for Duryodhana, those who seek to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra by engaging in war. 21  SANJAYA  Thus Arjuna spoke, and Sri Krishna, driving his splendid chariot between the two armies, 25 facing Bhishma and Drona and all the kings of the earth, said: Arjuna, behold all the Kurus gathered together. 24  And Arjuna, standing between the two armies, saw fathers and grandfathers, teachers, uncles, and brothers, sons and grandsons, 27 in-laws and friends. Seeing his kinsmen established in opposition, 28 Arjuna was overcome by sorrow. Despairing, he spoke these words: 26  \\x0cARJUNA  O Krishna, I see my own relations here anxious to fight, 29 and my limbs grow weak; my mouth is dry, my body shakes, and my hair is standing on end. 30 My skin burns, and the bow Gandiva has slipped from my hand. I am unable to stand; my mind seems to be whirling. 31 These signs bode evil for us. I do not see that any good can come from killing our relations in battle. 32 O Krishna, I have no desire for victory, or for a kingdom or pleasures. Of what use is a kingdom or pleasure or even life, 33 if those for whose sake we desire these things  34 teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, in-laws, grandsons, and others with family ties  are engaging in this battle, renouncing their wealth and their lives? 35 Even if they were to kill me, I would not want to kill them, not even to become ruler of the three worlds. How much less for the earth alone? O Krishna, what satisfaction could we find in killing Dhritarashtras sons? We would become sinners by slaying these men, even though they are evil. 37 The sons of Dhritarashtra are related to us; therefore, we should not kill them. How can we gain happiness by killing members of our own family? 36  Though they are overpowered by greed and see no evil in destroying families or injuring friends, we see these evils. 39 Why shouldnt we turn away from this sin? 40 When a family declines, ancient traditions are destroyed. With them are lost the spiritual foundations for life, and the family loses its sense of unity. 41 Where there is no sense of unity, the women of the family become corrupt; and with the corruption of its women, society is plunged into chaos. 42 Social chaos is hell for the family and for those who have destroyed the family as well. It disrupts the process of spiritual evolution begun by our ancestors. 43 The timeless spiritual foundations of family and society would be destroyed by these terrible deeds, which violate the unity of life. 38  It is said that those whose family dharma has been destroyed dwell in hell. 45 This is a great sin! We are prepared to kill our own relations out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. 46 Better for 44  \\x0cme if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, were to attack me in battle and kill me unarmed and unresisting. SANJAYA  Overwhelmed by sorrow, Arjuna spoke these words. And casting away his bow and his arrows, he sat down in his chariot in the middle of the battlefield. 47  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c2: Self-Realization SANJAYA  These are the words that Sri Krishna spoke to the despairing Arjuna, whose eyes were burning with tears of pity and confusion. 1  KRISHNA  This despair and weakness in a time of crisis are mean and unworthy of you, Arjuna. How have you fallen into a state so far from the path to liberation? 3 It does not become you to yield to this weakness. Arise with a brave heart and destroy the enemy. 2  ARJUNA  How can I ever bring myself to fight against Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of reverence? How can I, Krishna? 5 Surely it would be better to spend my life begging than to kill these great and worthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would be tainted. 6 I dont even know which would be better, for us to conquer them or for them to conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashtra have confronted us; but why would we care to live if we killed them? 4  My will is paralyzed, and I am utterly confused. Tell me which is the better path for me. Let me be your disciple. I have fallen at your feet; give me instruction. 8 What can overcome a sorrow that saps all my vitality? Even power over men and gods or the wealth of an empire seem empty. 7  SANJAYA  \\x0cThis is how Arjuna, the great warrior, spoke to Sri Krishna. With the words, O Krishna, I will not fight, he fell silent. 10 As they stood between the two armies, Sri Krishna smiled and replied to Arjuna, who had sunk into despair. 9  KRISHNA  You speak sincerely, but your sorrow has no cause. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. 12 There has never been a time when you and I and the kings gathered here have not existed, nor will there be a time when we will cease to exist. 13 As the same person inhabits the body through childhood, youth, and old age, so too at the time of death he attains another body. The wise are not deluded by these changes. 11  When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. 15 Those who are unaffected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. Assert your strength and realize this! 14  The impermanent has no reality; reality lies in the eternal. Those who have seen the boundary between these two have attained the end of all knowledge. 17 Realize that which pervades the universe and is indestructible; no power can affect this unchanging, imperishable reality. 18 The body is mortal, but that which dwells in the body is immortal and immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, fight in this battle. 16  One believes he is the slayer, another believes he is the slain. Both are ignorant; there is neither slayer nor slain. 20 You were never born; you will never die. You have never changed; you can never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, you do not die when the body dies. 21 Realizing that which is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and unchanging, how can you slay or cause another to slay? 19  \\x0cAs one abandons worn-out clothes and acquires new ones, so when the body is worn out a new one is acquired by the Self, who lives within. 22  The Self cannot be pierced by weapons or burned by fire; water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it. 24 The Self cannot be pierced or burned, made wet or dry. It is everlasting and infinite, standing on the motionless foundations of eternity. 25 The Self is unmanifested, beyond all thought, beyond all change. Knowing this, you should not grieve. 23  O mighty Arjuna, even if you believe the Self to be subject to birth and death, you should not grieve. 27 Death is inevitable for the living; birth is inevitable for the dead. Since these are unavoidable, you should not sorrow. 28 Every creature is unmanifested at first and then attains manifestation. When its end has come, it once again becomes unmanifested. What is there to lament in this? 26  The glory of the Self is beheld by a few, and a few describe it; a few listen, but many without understanding. 30 The Self of all beings, living within the body, is eternal and cannot be harmed. Therefore, do not grieve. 29  Considering your dharma, you should not vacillate. For a warrior, nothing is higher than a war against evil. 32 The warrior confronted with such a war should be pleased, Arjuna, for it comes as an open gate to heaven. 33 But if you do not participate in this battle against evil, you will incur sin, violating your dharma and your honor. 31  The story of your dishonor will be repeated endlessly: and for a man of honor, dishonor is worse than death. 35 These brave warriors will think you have withdrawn from battle out of fear, and those who formerly esteemed you will treat you with disrespect. 36 Your enemies will ridicule your strength and say things that should not be said. What could be more painful than this? 34  Death means the attainment of heaven; victory means the enjoyment of the earth. Therefore rise up, Arjuna, resolved to fight! 37  \\x0cHaving made yourself alike in pain and pleasure, profit and loss, victory and defeat, engage in this great battle and you will be freed from sin. 38  You have heard the intellectual explanation of Sankhya, Arjuna; now listen to the principles of yoga. By practicing these you can break through the bonds of karma. 40 On this path effort never goes to waste, and there is no failure. Even a little effort toward spiritual awareness will protect you from the greatest fear. 39  Those who follow this path, resolving deep within themselves to seek me alone, attain singleness of purpose. For those who lack resolution, the decisions of life are many-branched and endless. 41  There are ignorant people who speak flowery words and take delight in the letter of the law, saying that there is nothing else. 43 Their hearts are full of selfish desires, Arjuna. Their idea of heaven is their own enjoyment, and the aim of all their activities is pleasure and power. The fruit of their actions is continual rebirth. 44 Those whose minds are swept away by the pursuit of pleasure and power are incapable of following the supreme goal and will not attain samadhi. 42  The scriptures describe the three gunas. But you should be free from the action of the gunas, established in eternal truth, selfcontrolled, without any sense of duality or the desire to acquire and hoard. 45  Just as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is flooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined man or woman, who sees the Lord everywhere. 46  You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. 48 Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself  without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. 47  \\x0cSeek refuge in the attitude of detachment and you will amass the wealth of spiritual awareness. Those who are motivated only by desire for the fruits of action are miserable, for they are constantly anxious about the results of what they do. 50 When consciousness is unified, however, all vain anxiety is left behind. There is no cause for worry, whether things go well or ill. Therefore, devote yourself to the disciplines of yoga, for yoga is skill in action. 49  The wise unify their consciousness and abandon attachment to the fruits of action, which binds a person to continual rebirth. Thus they attain a state beyond all evil. 51  When your mind has overcome the confusion of duality, you will attain the state of holy indifference to things you hear and things you have heard. 53 When you are unmoved by the confusion of ideas and your mind is completely united in deep samadhi, you will attain the state of perfect yoga. 52  ARJUNA  Tell me of those who live established in wisdom, ever aware of the Self, O Krishna. How do they talk? How sit? How move about? 54  KRISHNA  They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them, who have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving tormenting the heart. 55  Neither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live free from lust and fear and anger. Established in meditation, they are truly wise. 57 Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are neither elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. Such are the seers. 56  Even as a tortoise draws in its limbs, the wise can draw in their senses at will. 59 Aspirants abstain from sense pleasures, but they still crave for them. These cravings all disappear when they see the highest goal. 60 Even of those who tread the path, the stormy senses 58  \\x0ccan sweep off the mind. 61 They live in wisdom who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in me. When you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. 63 Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste. 64 But when you move amidst the world of sense, free from attachment and aversion alike, 65 there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you live in the wisdom of the Self. 62  The disunited mind is far from wise; how can it meditate? How be at peace? When you know no peace, how can you know joy? 67 When you let your mind follow the call of the senses, they carry away your better judgment as storms drive a boat off its charted course on the sea. 66  Use all your power to free the senses from attachment and aversion alike, and live in the full wisdom of the Self. 69 Such a sage awakes to light in the night of all creatures. That which the world calls day is the night of ignorance to the wise. 68  As rivers flow into the ocean but cannot make the vast ocean overflow, so flow the streams of the sense-world into the sea of peace that is the sage. But this is not so with the desirer of desires. 70  They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away from the ego-cage of I, me, and mine to be united with the Lord. 72 This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality. 71  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c3: Selfless Service ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have said that knowledge is greater than action; why then do you ask me to wage this terrible war? 2 Your advice seems inconsistent. Give me one path to follow to the supreme good. 1  KRISHNA  At the beginning of time I declared two paths for the pure heart: jnana yoga, the contemplative path of spiritual wisdom, and karma yoga, the active path of selfless service. 3  One who shirks action does not attain freedom; no one can gain perfection by abstaining from work. 5 Indeed, there is no one who rests for even an instant; all creatures are driven to action by their own nature. 4  Those who abstain from action while allowing the mind to dwell on sensual pleasure cannot be called sincere spiritual aspirants. 7 But they excel who control their senses through the mind, using them for selfless service. 6  Fulfill all your duties; action is better than inaction. Even to maintain your body, Arjuna, you are obliged to act. 9 Selfish action imprisons the world. Act selflessly, without any thought of personal profit. 8  At the beginning, mankind and the obligation of selfless service were created together. Through selfless service, you will always be 10  \\x0cfruitful and find the fulfillment of your desires: this is the promise of the Creator. Honor and cherish the devas as they honor and cherish you; through this honor and love you will attain the supreme good. 12 All human desires are fulfilled by the devas, who are pleased by selfless service. But anyone who enjoys the things given by the devas without offering selfless acts in return is a thief. 11  The spiritually minded, who eat in the spirit of service, are freed from all their sins; but the selfish, who prepare food for their own satisfaction, eat sin. 14 Living creatures are nourished by food, and food is nourished by rain; rain itself is the water of life, which comes from selfless worship and service. 13  Every selfless act, Arjuna, is born from Brahman, the eternal, infinite Godhead. Brahman is present in every act of service. 16 All life turns on this law, O Arjuna. Those who violate it, indulging the senses for their own pleasure and ignoring the needs of others, have wasted their life. 17 But those who realize the Self are always satisfied. Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no longer seek happiness from the external world. 18 They have nothing to gain or lose by any action; neither people nor things can affect their security. 15  Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. 20 Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path. 19  What the outstanding person does, others will try to do. The standards such people create will be followed by the whole world. 22 There is nothing in the three worlds for me to gain, Arjuna, nor is there anything I do not have; I continue to act, but I am not driven by any need of my own. 23 If I ever refrained from continuous work, everyone would immediately follow my example. 24 If I stopped working I would be the cause of cosmic chaos, and finally of the destruction of this world and these people. 21  \\x0cThe ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare of the world, without thought for themselves. 26 By abstaining from work you will confuse the ignorant, who are engrossed in their actions. Perform all work carefully, guided by compassion. 25  All actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti. Deluded by identification with the ego, a person thinks, I am the doer. 28 But the illumined man or woman understands the domain of the gunas and is not attached. Such people know that the gunas interact with each other; they do not claim to be the doer. 27  Those who are deluded by the operation of the gunas become attached to the results of their action. Those who understand these truths should not unsettle the ignorant. 30 Performing all actions for my sake, completely absorbed in the Self, and without expectations, fight!  but stay free from the fever of the ego. 29  Those who live in accordance with these divine laws without complaining, firmly established in faith, are released from karma. 32 Those who violate these laws, criticizing and complaining, are utterly deluded, and are the cause of their own suffering. 31  Even the wise act within the limitations of their own nature. Every creature is subject to prakriti; what is the use of repression? 34 The senses have been conditioned by attraction to the pleasant and aversion to the unpleasant. Do not be ruled by them; they are obstacles in your path. 33  It is better to strive in ones own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following ones own dharma, but competition in anothers dharma breeds fear and insecurity. 35  ARJUNA  What is the force that binds us to selfish deeds, O Krishna? What power moves us, even against our will, as if forcing us? 36  \\x0cKRISHNA  It is selfish desire and anger, arising from the guna of rajas; these are the appetites and evils which threaten a person in this life. 37  Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, just as the embryo rests deep within the womb, knowledge is hidden by selfish desire  39 hidden, Arjuna, by this unquenchable fire for self-satisfaction, the inveterate enemy of the wise. 38  Selfish desire is found in the senses, mind, and intellect, misleading them and burying the understanding in delusion. 41 Fight with all your strength, Arjuna! Controlling your senses, conquer your enemy, the destroyer of knowledge and realization. 40  The senses are higher than the body, the mind higher than the senses; above the mind is the intellect, and above the intellect is the Atman. 43 Thus, knowing that which is supreme, let the Atman rule the ego. Use your mighty arms to slay the fierce enemy that is selfish desire. 42  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c4: Wisdom in Action KRISHNA  I told this eternal secret to Vivasvat. Vivasvat taught Manu, and Manu taught Ikshvaku. 2 Thus, Arjuna, eminent sages received knowledge of yoga in a continuous tradition. But through time the practice of yoga was lost in the world. 1  The secret of these teachings is profound. I have explained them to you today because you are my friend and devotee. 3  ARJUNA  You were born much after Vivasvat; he lived very long ago. Why do you say that you taught this yoga in the beginning? 4  KRISHNA  You and I have passed through many births, Arjuna. You have forgotten, but I remember them all. 5  My true being is unborn and changeless. I am the Lord who dwells in every creature. Through the power of my own maya, I manifest myself in a finite form. 6  Whenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I manifest myself on earth. 8 I am born in every age to protect the good, to destroy evil, and to reestablish dharma. 7  Those who know me as their own divine Self break through the belief that they are the body and are not reborn as separate creatures. Such a one, Arjuna, is united with me. 10 Delivered from selfish 9  \\x0cattachment, fear, and anger, filled with me, surrendering themselves to me, purified in the fire of my being, many have reached the state of unity in me. As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. 11  Those desiring success in their actions worship the gods; through action in the world of mortals, their desires are quickly fulfilled. 13 The distinctions of caste, guna, and karma have come from me. I am their cause, but I myself am changeless and beyond all action. 14 Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results. Those who understand this and practice it live in freedom. 15 Knowing this truth, aspirants desiring liberation in ancient times engaged in action. You too can do the same, pursuing an active life in the manner of those ancient sages. 12  What is action and what is inaction? This question has confused the greatest sages. I will give you the secret of action, with which you can free yourself from bondage. 17 The true nature of action is difficult to grasp. You must understand what is action and what is inaction, and what kind of action should be avoided. 16  The wise see that there is action in the midst of inaction and inaction in the midst of action. Their consciousness is unified, and every act is done with complete awareness. 18  The awakened sages call a person wise when all his undertakings are free from anxiety about results; all his selfish desires have been consumed in the fire of knowledge. 20 The wise, ever satisfied, have abandoned all external supports. Their security is unaffected by the results of their action; even while acting, they really do nothing at all. 21 Free from expectations and from all sense of possession, with mind and body firmly controlled by the Self, they do not incur sin by the performance of physical action. 19  They live in freedom who have gone beyond the dualities of life. Competing with no one, they are alike in success and failure and 22  \\x0ccontent with whatever comes to them. 23 They are free, without selfish attachments; their minds are fixed in knowledge. They perform all work in the spirit of service, and their karma is dissolved. The process of offering is Brahman; that which is offered is Brahman. Brahman offers the sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. Brahman is attained by those who see Brahman in every action. 24  Some aspirants offer material sacrifices to the gods. Others offer selfless service as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. 26 Some renounce all enjoyment of the senses, sacrificing them in the fire of sense restraint. Others partake of sense objects but offer them in service through the fire of the senses. 27 Some offer the workings of the senses and the vital forces through the fire of self-control, kindled in the path of knowledge. 25  Some offer wealth; others offer sense restraint and suffering. Some take vows and offer knowledge and study of the scriptures; and some make the offering of meditation. 29 Some offer the forces of vitality, regulating their inhalation and exhalation, and thus gain control over these forces. 30 Others offer the forces of vitality through restraint of their senses. All these understand the meaning of service and will be cleansed of their impurities. 28  True sustenance is in service, and through it a man or woman reaches the eternal Brahman. But those who do not seek to serve are without a home in this world. Arjuna, how can they be at home in any world to come? 31  These offerings are born of work, and each guides mankind along a path to Brahman. Understanding this, you will attain liberation. 33 The offering of wisdom is better than any material offering, Arjuna; for the goal of all work is spiritual wisdom. 32  Approach those who have realized the purpose of life and question them with reverence and devotion; they will instruct you in 34  \\x0cthis wisdom. 35 Once you attain it, you will never again be deluded. You will see all creatures in the Self, and all in me. Even if you were the most sinful of sinners, Arjuna, you could cross beyond all sin by the raft of spiritual wisdom. 37 As the heat of a fire reduces wood to ashes, the fire of knowledge burns to ashes all karma. 38 Nothing in this world purifies like spiritual wisdom. It is the perfection achieved in time through the path of yoga, the path which leads to the Self within. 36  Those who take wisdom as their highest goal, whose faith is deep and whose senses are trained, attain wisdom quickly and enter into perfect peace. 40 But the ignorant, indecisive and lacking in faith, waste their lives. They can never be happy in this world or any other. 39  Those established in the Self have renounced selfish attachments to their actions and cut through doubts with spiritual wisdom. They act in freedom. 42 Arjuna, cut through this doubt in your own heart with the sword of spiritual wisdom. Arise; take up the path of yoga! 41  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c5: Renounce & Rejoice ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have recommended both the path of selfless action and sannyasa, the path of renunciation of action. Tell me definitely which is better. 1  KRISHNA  Both renunciation of action and the selfless performance of action lead to the supreme goal. But the path of action is better than renunciation. 2  Those who have attained perfect renunciation are free from any sense of duality; they are unaffected by likes and dislikes, Arjuna, and are free from the bondage of self-will. 4 The immature think that knowledge and action are different, but the wise see them as the same. The person who is established in one path will attain the rewards of both. 5 The goal of knowledge and the goal of service are the same; those who fail to see this are blind. 3  Perfect renunciation is difficult to attain without performing action. But the wise, following the path of selfless service, quickly reach Brahman. 6  Those who follow the path of service, who have completely purified themselves and conquered their senses and self-will, see the Self in all creatures and are untouched by any action they perform. 7  Those who know this truth, whose consciousness is unified, think always, I am not the doer. While seeing or hearing, touching or 8  \\x0csmelling; eating, moving about, or sleeping; breathing 9 or speaking, letting go or holding on, even opening or closing the eyes, they understand that these are only the movements of the senses among sense objects. Those who surrender to Brahman all selfish attachments are like the leaf of a lotus floating clean and dry in water. Sin cannot touch them. 11 Renouncing their selfish attachments, those who follow the path of service work with body, senses, and mind for the sake of self-purification. 10  Those whose consciousness is unified abandon all attachment to the results of action and attain supreme peace. But those whose desires are fragmented, who are selfishly attached to the results of their work, are bound in everything they do. 12  Those who renounce attachment in all their deeds live content in the city of nine gates, the body, as its master. They are not driven to act, nor do they involve others in action. 13  Neither the sense of acting, nor actions, nor the connection of cause and effect comes from the Lord of this world. These three arise from nature. 14  The Lord does not partake in the good and evil deeds of any person; judgment is clouded when wisdom is obscured by ignorance. 16 But ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self within. The light of this knowledge shines like the sun, revealing the supreme Brahman. 17 Those who cast off sin through this knowledge, absorbed in the Lord and established in him as their one goal and refuge, are not reborn as separate creatures. 15  Those who possess this wisdom have equal regard for all. They see the same Self in a spiritual aspirant and an outcaste, in an elephant, a cow, and a dog. 19 Such people have mastered life. With even mind they rest in Brahman, who is perfect and is everywhere the same. 20 They are not elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. With mind established in Brahman, they are free from delusion. 18  \\x0cNot dependent on any external support, they realize the joy of spiritual awareness. With consciousness unified through meditation, they live in abiding joy. 21  Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses have a beginning and an end and give birth to misery, Arjuna. The wise do not look for happiness in them. 23 But those who overcome the impulses of lust and anger which arise in the body are made whole and live in joy. 24 They find their joy, their rest, and their light completely within themselves. United with the Lord, they attain nirvana in Brahman. 22  Healed of their sins and conflicts, working for the good of all beings, the holy sages attain nirvana in Brahman. 26 Free from anger and selfish desire, unified in mind, those who follow the path of yoga and realize the Self are established forever in that supreme state. 25  Closing their eyes, steadying their breathing, and focusing their attention on the center of spiritual consciousness, 28 the wise master their senses, mind, and intellect through meditation. Self-realization is their only goal. Freed from selfish desire, fear, and anger, they live in freedom always. 29 Knowing me as the friend of all creatures, the Lord of the universe, the end of all offerings and all spiritual disciplines, they attain eternal peace. 27  \\x0c']\n",
            "[' The general Hindu belief is that Self-realization requires many, many lives of spiritual discipline.   \\x0c6: Practice of Meditation KRISHNA  It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those who work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of meditation. Theirs is true renunciation. 2 Therefore, Arjuna, you should understand that renunciation and the performance of selfless service are the same. Those who cannot renounce attachment to the results of their work are far from the path. 1  For aspirants who want to climb the mountain of spiritual awareness, the path is selfless work; for those who have ascended to yoga the path is stillness and peace. 4 When a person has freed himself from attachment to the results of work, and from desires for the enjoyment of sense objects, he ascends to the unitive state. 3  Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. 5  To those who have conquered themselves, the will is a friend. But it is the enemy of those who have not found the Self within them. 6  The supreme Reality stands revealed in the consciousness of those who have conquered themselves. They live in peace, alike in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. 7  They are completely fulfilled by spiritual wisdom and Selfrealization. Having conquered their senses, they have climbed to the summit of human consciousness. To such people a clod of dirt, a stone, and gold are the same. 9 They are equally disposed to family, 8  \\x0cenemies, and friends, to those who support them and those who are hostile, to the good and the evil alike. Because they are impartial, they rise to great heights. Those who aspire to the state of yoga should seek the Self in inner solitude through meditation. With body and mind controlled they should constantly practice one-pointedness, free from expectations and attachment to material possessions. 10  Select a clean spot, neither too high nor too low, and seat yourself firmly on a cloth, a deerskin, and kusha grass. 12 Then, once seated, strive to still your thoughts. Make your mind one-pointed in meditation, and your heart will be purified. 13 Hold your body, head, and neck firmly in a straight line, and keep your eyes from wandering. 14 With all fears dissolved in the peace of the Self and all desires dedicated to Brahman, controlling the mind and fixing it on me, sit in meditation with me as your only goal. 15 With senses and mind constantly controlled through meditation, united with the Self within, an aspirant attains nirvana, the state of abiding joy and peace in me. 11  Arjuna, those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too much or sleep too little, will not succeed in meditation. 17 But those who are temperate in eating and sleeping, work and recreation, will come to the end of sorrow through meditation. 18 Through constant effort they learn to withdraw the mind from selfish cravings and absorb it in the Self. Thus they attain the state of union. 16  When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp in a windless place. 20 In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. 21 Having attained that abiding joy beyond the senses, revealed in the stilled mind, he never swerves from the eternal truth. 22 He desires nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow. 19  \\x0cThe practice of meditation frees one from all affliction. This is the path of yoga. Follow it with determination and sustained enthusiasm. 24 Renouncing wholeheartedly all selfish desires and expectations, use your will to control the senses. 25 Little by little, through patience and repeated effort, the mind will become stilled in the Self. 23  Wherever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for satisfaction without, lead it within; train it to rest in the Self 27 Abiding joy comes to those who still the mind. Freeing themselves from the taint of self-will, with their consciousness unified, they become one with Brahman. 26  The infinite joy of touching Brahman is easily attained by those who are free from the burden of evil and established within themselves. 29 They see the Self in every creature and all creation in the Self. With consciousness unified through meditation, they see everything with an equal eye. 28  I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me. 31 They worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. 30  When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. 32  ARJUNA  O Krishna, the stillness of divine union which you describe is beyond my comprehension. How can the mind, which is so restless, attain lasting peace? 34 Krishna, the mind is restless, turbulent, powerful, violent; trying to control it is like trying to tame the wind. 33  KRISHNA  \\x0cIt is true that the mind is restless and difficult to control. But it can be conquered, Arjuna, through regular practice and detachment. 36 Those who lack self-control will find it difficult to progress in meditation; but those who are self-controlled, striving earnestly through the right means, will attain the goal. 35  ARJUNA  Krishna, what happens to the man who has faith but who lacks self-control and wanders from the path, not attaining success in yoga? 38 If a man becomes deluded on the spiritual path, will he lose the support of both worlds, like a cloud scattered in the sky? 39 Krishna, you can dispel all doubts; remove this doubt which binds me. 37  KRISHNA  Arjuna, my son, such a person will not be destroyed. No one who does good work will ever come to a bad end, either here or in the world to come. 40  When such people die, they go to other realms where the righteous live. They dwell there for countless years and then are reborn into a home which is pure and prosperous. 42 Or they may be born into a family where meditation is practiced; to be born into such a family is extremely rare. 43 The wisdom they have acquired in previous lives will be reawakened, Arjuna, and they will strive even harder for Self-realization. 44 Indeed, they will be driven on by the strength of their past disciplines. Even one who inquires after the practice of meditation rises above those who simply perform rituals. 41  Through constant effort over many lifetimes, a person becomes purified of all selfish desires and attains the supreme goal of life. 45  Meditation is superior to severe asceticism and the path of knowledge. It is also superior to selfless service. May you attain the goal of meditation, Arjuna! 47 Even among those who meditate, that 46  \\x0cman or woman who worships me with perfect faith, completely absorbed in me, is the most firmly established in yoga.  \\x0c']\n",
            "['    \\x0c7: Wisdom from Realization KRISHNA  With your mind intent on me, Arjuna, discipline yourself with the practice of yoga. Depend on me completely. Listen, and I will dispel all your doubts; you will come to know me fully and be united with me. 1  I will give you both jnana and vijnana. When both these are realized, there is nothing more you need to know. 2  One person in many thousands may seek perfection, yet of these only a few reach the goal and come to realize me. 4 Earth, water, fire, air, akasha, mind, intellect, and ego  these are the eight divisions of my prakriti. 5 But beyond this I have another, higher nature, Arjuna; it supports the whole universe and is the source of life in all beings. 3  In these two aspects of my nature is the womb of all creation. The birth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. 7 There is nothing that exists separate from me, Arjuna. The entire universe is suspended from me as my necklace of jewels. 6  Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings. 9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant. 8  My eternal seed, Arjuna, is to be found in every creature. I am the power of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory 10  \\x0cof the noble. 11 In those who are strong, I am strength, free from passion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life. The states of sattva, rajas, and tamas come from me, but I am not in them. 13 These three gunas deceive the world: people fail to look beyond them to me, supreme and imperishable. 14 The three gunas make up my divine maya, difficult to overcome. But they cross over this maya who take refuge in me. 15 Others are deluded by maya; performing evil deeds, they have no devotion to me. Having lost all discrimination, they follow the way of their lower nature. 12  Good people come to worship me for different reasons. Some come to the spiritual life because of suffering, some in order to understand life; some come through a desire to achieve lifes purpose, and some come who are men and women of wisdom. 17 Unwavering in devotion, always united with me, the man or woman of wisdom surpasses all the others. To them I am the dearest beloved, and they are very dear to me. 18 All those who follow the spiritual path are blessed. But the wise who are always established in union, for whom there is no higher goal than me, may be regarded as my very Self. 16  After many births the wise seek refuge in me, seeing me everywhere and in everything. Such great souls are very rare. 20 There are others whose discrimination is misled by many desires. Following their own nature, they worship lower gods, practicing various rites. 19  When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that. 22 Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. 23 Those whose understanding is small attain only transient satisfaction: those who worship the gods go to the gods. But my devotees come to me. 21  Through lack of understanding, people believe that I, the Unmanifest, have entered into some form. They fail to realize my 24  \\x0ctrue nature, which transcends birth and death. 25 Few see through the veil of maya. The world, deluded, does not know that I am without birth and changeless. 26 I know everything about the past, the present, and the future, Arjuna; but there is no one who knows me completely. Delusion arises from the duality of attraction and aversion, Arjuna; every creature is deluded by these from birth. 28 But those who have freed themselves from all wrongdoing are firmly established in worship of me. Their actions are pure, and they are free from the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites. 27  Those who take refuge in me, striving for liberation from old age and death, come to know Brahman, the Self, and the nature of all action. 30 Those who see me ruling the cosmos, who see me in the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva, and the adhiyajna, are conscious of me even at the time of death. 29  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c8: Eternal Godhead ARJUNA  O Krishna, what is Brahman, and what is the nature of action? What is the adhyatma, the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva? 2 What is the adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, and how is it to be offered? How are the self-controlled united with you at the time of death? 1  KRISHNA  My highest nature, the imperishable Brahman, gives every creature its existence and lives in every creature as the adhyatma. My action is creation and the bringing forth of creatures. 4 The adhibhuta is the perishable body; the adhidaiva is Purusha, eternal spirit. The adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, is made to me as the Lord within you. 3  Those who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do not doubt this. 6 Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death determines the destination of the dying; always they will tend toward that state of being. 7 Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. 8 When you make your mind one-pointed through regular practice of meditation, you will find the supreme glory of the Lord. 5  The Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler, subtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable, bright as the sun, beyond darkness. 10 Remembering him in this way at the time of death, through devotion and the power of meditation, with your mind completely stilled and your concentration fixed in 9  \\x0cthe center of spiritual awareness between the eyebrows, you will realize the supreme Lord. I will tell you briefly of the eternal state all scriptures affirm, which can be entered only by those who are self-controlled and free from selfish passions. Those whose lives are dedicated to Brahman attain this supreme goal. 11  Remembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of the senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in meditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. 13 Repeating in this state the divine name, the syllable Om that represents the changeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the supreme goal. 12  I am easily attained by the person who always remembers me and is attached to nothing else. Such a person is a true yogi, Arjuna. 15 Great souls make their lives perfect and discover me; they are freed from mortality and the suffering of this separate existence. 16 Every creature in the universe is subject to rebirth, Arjuna, except the one who is united with me. 14  Those who understand the cosmic laws know that the Day of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas and the Night of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas. 18 When the day of Brahma dawns, forms are brought forth from the Unmanifest; when the night of Brahma comes, these forms merge in the Formless again. 19 This multitude of beings is created and destroyed again and again in the succeeding days and nights of Brahma. 20 But beyond this formless state there is another, unmanifested reality, which is eternal and is not dissolved when the cosmos is destroyed. 21 Those who realize lifes supreme goal know that I am unmanifested and unchanging. Having come home to me, they never return to separate existence. 17  This supreme Lord who pervades all existence, the true Self of all creatures, may be realized through undivided love. 23 There are two paths, Arjuna, which the soul may follow at the time of death. One leads to rebirth and the other to liberation. 22  \\x0cThe six months of the northern path of the sun, the path of light, of fire, of day, of the bright fortnight, leads knowers of Brahman to the supreme goal. 25 The six months of the southern path of the sun, the path of smoke, of night, of the dark fortnight, leads other souls to the light of the moon and to rebirth. 24  These two paths, the light and the dark, are said to be eternal, leading some to liberation and others to rebirth. 27 Once you have known these two paths, Arjuna, you can never be deluded again. Attain this knowledge through perseverance in yoga. 28 There is merit in studying the scriptures, in selfless service, austerity, and giving, but the practice of meditation carries you beyond all these to the supreme abode of the highest Lord. 26  \\x0c']\n",

Righteous and imperishable, it is a joy to practice and can be directly experienced. 3 But those who have no faith in the supreme law of life do not find me, Arjuna. They return to the world, passing from death to death. 2  I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifested form. All creatures find their existence in me, but I am not limited by them. 5 Behold my divine mystery! These creatures do not really dwell in me, and though I bring them forth and support them, I am not confined within them. 6 They move in me as the winds move in every direction in space. 4  At the end of the eon these creatures return to unmanifested matter; at the beginning of the next cycle I send them forth again. 8 Controlling my prakriti, again and again I bring forth these myriad forms and subject them to the laws of prakriti. 9 None of these actions binds me, Arjuna. I am unattached to them, so they do not disturb my nature. 7  Under my watchful eye the laws of nature take their course. Thus is the world set in motion; thus the animate and the inanimate are created. 10  \\x0cThe immature do not look beyond physical appearances to see my true nature as the Lord of all creation. 12 The knowledge of such deluded people is empty; their lives are fraught with disaster and evil, and their work and hopes are all in vain. 11  But truly great souls seek my divine nature. They worship me with a one-pointed mind, having realized that I am the eternal source of all. 14 Constantly striving, they make firm their resolve and worship me without wavering. Full of devotion, they sing of my divine glory. 13  Others follow the path of jnana, spiritual wisdom. They see that where there is One, that One is me; where there are many, all are me; they see my face everywhere. 15  I am the ritual and the sacrifice; I am true medicine and the mantram. I am the offering and the fire which consumes it, and the one to whom it is offered. 16  I am the father and mother of this universe, and its grandfather too; I am its entire support. I am the sum of all knowledge, the purifier, the syllable Om; I am the sacred scriptures, the Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas. 17  I am the goal of life, the Lord and support of all, the inner witness, the abode of all. I am the only refuge, the one true friend; I am the beginning, the staying, and the end of creation; I am the womb and the eternal seed. 18  I am heat; I give and withhold the rain. I am immortality and I am death; I am what is and what is not. 19  Those who follow the rituals given in the Vedas, who offer sacrifices and take soma, free themselves from evil and attain the vast heaven of the gods, where they enjoy celestial pleasures. 21 When they have enjoyed these fully, their merit is exhausted and they return to this land of death. Thus observing Vedic rituals but caught in an endless chain of desires, they come and go. 20  \\x0cThose who worship me and meditate on me constantly, without any other thought  I will provide for all their needs. 22  Those who worship other gods with faith and devotion also worship me, Arjuna, even if they do not observe the usual forms. 24 I am the object of all worship, its enjoyer and Lord. But those who fail to realize my true nature must be reborn. 25 Those who worship the devas will go to the realm of the devas; those who worship their ancestors will be united with them after death. Those who worship phantoms will become phantoms; but my devotees will come to me. 23  Whatever I am offered in devotion with a pure heart  a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water  I accept with joy. 27 Whatever you do, make it an offering to me  the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. 28 In this way you will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and painful. Then, firm in renunciation and yoga, with your heart free, you will come to me. 26  I look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and none more dear. But those who worship me with love live in me, and I come to life in them. 29  Even sinners become holy when they take refuge in me alone. 31 Quickly their souls conform to dharma and they attain to boundless peace. Never forget this, Arjuna: no one who is devoted to me will ever come to harm. 30  All those who take refuge in me, whatever their birth, race, sex, or caste, will attain the supreme goal; this realization can be attained even by those whom society scorns. 33 Kings and sages too seek this goal with devotion. Therefore, having been born in this transient and forlorn world, give all your love to me. 34 Fill your mind with me; love me; serve me; worship me always. Seeking me in your heart, you will at last be united with me. 32  \\x0c']\n",

I am the silence of the unknown and the wisdom of the wise. 38  I am the seed that can be found in every creature, Arjuna; for without me nothing can exist, neither animate nor inanimate. 39  But there is no end to my divine attributes, Arjuna; these I have mentioned are only a few. 41 Wherever you find strength, or beauty, or spiritual power, you may be sure that these have sprung from a spark of my essence. 40  But of what use is it to you to know all this, Arjuna? Just remember that I am, and that I support the entire cosmos with only a fragment of my being. 42  \\x0c']\n",

Through your words my delusion is gone. 2 You have explained the origin and end of every creature, O lotus-eyed one, and told me of your own supreme, limitless existence. 1  Just as you have described your infinite glory, O Lord, now I long to see it. I want to see you as the supreme ruler of creation. 4 O Lord, master of yoga, if you think me strong enough to behold it, show me your immortal Self. 3  KRISHNA  Behold, Arjuna, a million divine forms, with an infinite variety of color and shape. 6 Behold the gods of the natural world, and many more wonders never revealed before. 7 Behold the entire cosmos turning within my body, and the other things you desire to see. 5  But these things cannot be seen with your physical eyes; therefore I give you spiritual vision to perceive my majestic power. 8  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, Krishna, the master of yoga, revealed to Arjuna his most exalted, lordly form. 9  He appeared with an infinite number of faces, ornamented by heavenly jewels, displaying unending miracles and the countless weapons of his power. 11 Clothed in celestial garments and covered with garlands, sweet-smelling with heavenly fragrances, he showed 10  \\x0chimself as the infinite Lord, the source of all wonders, whose face is everywhere. If a thousand suns were to rise in the heavens at the same time, the blaze of their light would resemble the splendor of that supreme spirit. 12  There, within the body of the God of gods, Arjuna saw all the manifold forms of the universe united as one. 14 Filled with amazement, his hair standing on end in ecstasy, he bowed before the Lord with joined palms and spoke these words. 13  ARJUNA  O Lord, I see within your body all the gods and every kind of living creature. I see Brahma, the Creator, seated on a lotus; I see the ancient sages and the celestial serpents. 15  I see infinite mouths and arms, stomachs and eyes, and you are embodied in every form. I see you everywhere, without beginning, middle, or end. You are the Lord of all creation, and the cosmos is your body. 16  You wear a crown and carry a mace and discus; your radiance is blinding and immeasurable. I see you, who are so difficult to behold, shining like a fiery sun blazing in every direction. 17  You are the supreme, changeless Reality, the one thing to be known. You are the refuge of all creation, the immortal spirit, the eternal guardian of eternal dharma. 18  You are without beginning, middle, or end; you touch everything with your infinite power. The sun and moon are your eyes, and your mouth is fire; your radiance warms the cosmos. 19  O Lord, your presence fills the heavens and the earth and reaches in every direction. I see the three worlds trembling before this vision of your wonderful and terrible form. 20  \\x0cThe gods enter your being, some calling out and greeting you in fear. Great saints sing your glory, praying, May all be well! 21  The multitudes of gods, demigods, and demons are all overwhelmed by the sight of you. 23 O mighty Lord, at the sight of your myriad eyes and mouths, arms and legs, stomachs and fearful teeth, I and the entire universe shake in terror. 22  O Vishnu, I can see your eyes shining; with open mouth, you glitter in an array of colors, and your body touches the sky. I look at you and my heart trembles; I have lost all courage and all peace of mind. 24  When I see your mouths with their fearful teeth, mouths burning like the fires at the end of time, I forget where I am and I have no place to go. O Lord, you are the support of the universe; have mercy on me! 25  I see all the sons of Dhritarashtra; I see Bhishma, Drona, and Karna; I see our warriors and all the kings who are here to fight. 27 All are rushing into your awful jaws; I see some of them crushed by your teeth. 28 As rivers flow into the ocean, all the warriors of this world are passing into your fiery jaws; 29 all creatures rush to their destruction like moths into a flame. 26  You lap the worlds into your burning mouths and swallow them. Filled with your terrible radiance, O Vishnu, the whole of creation bursts into flames. 30  Tell me who you are, O Lord of terrible form. I bow before you; have mercy! I want to know who you are, you who existed before all creation. Your nature and workings confound me. 31  KRISHNA  I am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world. Even without your participation, all the warriors gathered here will die. 32  \\x0cTherefore arise, Arjuna; conquer your enemies and enjoy the glory of sovereignty. I have already slain all these warriors; you will only be my instrument. 33  Bhishma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna, and many others are already slain. Kill those whom I have killed. Do not hesitate. Fight in this battle and you will conquer your enemies. 34  SANJAYA  Having heard these words, Arjuna trembled in fear. With joined palms he bowed before Krishna and addressed him stammering. 35  ARJUNA  O Krishna, it is right that the world delights and rejoices in your praise, that all the saints and sages bow down to you and all evil flees before you to the far corners of the universe. 36  How could they not worship you, O Lord? You are the eternal spirit, who existed before Brahma the Creator and who will never cease to be. Lord of the gods, you are the abode of the universe. Changeless, you are what is and what is not, and beyond the duality of existence and nonexistence. 37  You are the first among the gods, the timeless spirit, the resting place of all beings. You are the knower and the thing which is known. You are the final home; with your infinite form you pervade the cosmos. 38  You are Vayu, god of wind; Yama, god of death; Agni, god of fire; Varuna, god of water. You are the moon and the creator Prajapati, and the great-grandfather of all creatures. I bow before you and salute you again and again. 39  You are behind me and in front of me; I bow to you on every side. Your power is immeasurable. You pervade everything; you are everything. 40  \\x0cSometimes, because we were friends, I rashly said, Oh, Krishna! Say, friend!  casual, careless remarks. Whatever I may have said lightly, whether we were playing or resting, alone or in company, sitting together or eating, 42 if it was disrespectful, forgive me for it, O Krishna. I did not know the greatness of your nature, unchanging and imperishable. 41  You are the father of the universe, of the animate and the inanimate; you are the object of all worship, the greatest guru. There is none to equal you in the three worlds. Who can match your power? 44 O gracious Lord, I prostrate myself before you and ask for your blessing. As a father forgives his son, or a friend a friend, or a lover his beloved, so should you forgive me. 43  I rejoice in seeing you as you have never been seen before, yet I am filled with fear by this vision of you as the abode of the universe. Please let me see you again as the shining God of gods. 46 Though you are the embodiment of all creation, let me see you again not with a thousand arms but with four, carrying the mace and discus and wearing a crown. 45  KRISHNA  Arjuna, through my grace you have been united with me and received this vision of my radiant, universal form, without beginning or end, which no one else has ever seen. 47  Not by knowledge of the Vedas, nor sacrifice, nor charity, nor rituals, nor even by severe asceticism has any other mortal seen what you have seen, O heroic Arjuna. 48  Do not be troubled; do not fear my terrible form. Let your heart be satisfied and your fears dispelled in looking at me as I was before. 49  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, the Lord once again assumed the gentle form of Krishna and consoled his devotee, who had been so 50  \\x0cafraid. ARJUNA  O Krishna, now that I have seen your gentle human form my mind is again composed and returned to normal. 51  KRISHNA  It is extremely difficult to obtain the vision you have had; even the gods long always to see me in this aspect. 53 Neither knowledge of the Vedas, nor austerity, nor charity, nor sacrifice can bring the vision you have seen. 54 But through unfailing devotion, Arjuna, you can know me, see me, and attain union with me. 55 Those who make me the supreme goal of all their work and act without selfish attachment, who devote themselves to me completely and are free from ill will for any creature, enter into me. 52  \\x0c']\n",

Better indeed is knowledge than mechanical practice. Better than knowledge is meditation. But better still is surrender of attachment to results, because there follows immediate peace. 12  That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure and pain, 14 patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me  with such as these I am in love. 13  Not agitating the world or by it agitated, they stand above the sway of elation, competition, and fear: that one is my beloved. 15  They are detached, pure, efficient, impartial, never anxious, selfless in all their undertakings; they are my devotees, very dear to me. 16  That one is dear to me who runs not after the pleasant or away from the painful, grieves not, lusts not, but lets things come and go as they happen. 17  That devotee who looks upon friend and foe with equal regard, who is not buoyed up by praise nor cast down by blame, alike in heat and cold, pleasure and pain, free from selfish attachments, 19 the same in honor and dishonor, quiet, ever full, in harmony everywhere, firm in faith  such a one is dear to me. 18  Those who meditate upon this immortal dharma as I have declared it, full of faith and seeking me as lifes supreme goal, are truly my devotees, and my love for them is very great. 20  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c13: The Field & the Knower KRISHNA  The body is called a field, Arjuna; the one who knows it is called the Knower of the field. This is the knowledge of those who know. 2 I am the Knower of the field in everyone, Arjuna. Knowledge of the field and its Knower is true knowledge. 1  Listen and I will explain the nature of the field and how change takes place within it. I will also describe the Knower of the field and his power. 4 These truths have been sung by great sages in a variety of ways, and expounded in precise arguments concerning Brahman. 3  The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy from which all these evolved. 6 In this field arise desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the body, intelligence, and will. 5  Those who know truly are free from pride and deceit. They are gentle, forgiving, upright, and pure, devoted to their spiritual teacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled. 8 Detached from sense objects and self-will, they have learned the painful lesson of separate birth and suffering, old age, disease, and death. 7  Free from selfish attachment, they do not get compulsively entangled even in home and family. They are even-minded through good fortune and bad. 10 Their devotion to me is undivided. Enjoying solitude and not following the crowd, they seek only me. 9  \\x0cThis is true knowledge, to seek the Self as the true end of wisdom always. To seek anything else is ignorance. 11  I will tell you of the wisdom that leads to immortality: the beginningless Brahman, which can be called neither being nor nonbeing. 12  It dwells in all, in every hand and foot and head, in every mouth and eye and ear in the universe. 14 Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. 13  It is both near and far, both within and without every creature; it moves and is unmoving. 16 In its subtlety it is beyond comprehension. It is indivisible, yet appears divided in separate creatures. Know it to be the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. 15  Dwelling in every heart, it is beyond darkness. It is called the light of light, the object and goal of knowledge, and knowledge itself. 17  I have revealed to you the nature of the field and the meaning and object of true knowledge. Those who are devoted to me, knowing these things, are united with me. 18  Know that prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning, and that from prakriti come the gunas and all that changes. 20 Prakriti is the agent, cause, and effect of every action, but it is Purusha that seems to experience pleasure and pain. 19  Purusha, resting in prakriti, witnesses the play of the gunas born of prakriti. But attachment to the gunas leads a person to be born for good or evil. 21  Within the body the supreme Purusha is called the witness, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the supreme Lord, the highest Self. 22  \\x0cWhoever realizes the true nature of Purusha, prakriti, and the gunas, whatever path he or she may follow, is not born separate again. 23  Some realize the Self within them through the practice of meditation, some by the path of wisdom, and others by selfless service. 25 Others may not know these paths; but hearing and following the instructions of an illumined teacher, they too go beyond death. 24  Whatever exists, Arjuna, animate or inanimate, is born through the union of the field and its Knower. 26  They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. 28 Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. 27  They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved. 30 When they see the variety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they attain fulfillment in Brahman. 29  This supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is touched by action. 32 As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every creature. 31  As the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the source of all light in the field. 34 Those who, with the eye of wisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to freedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal. 33  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c14: Forces of Evolution KRISHNA  Let me tell you more about the wisdom that transcends all knowledge, through which the saints and sages attained perfection. 2 Those who rely on this wisdom will be united with me. For them there is neither rebirth nor fear of death. 1  My womb is prakriti; in that I place the seed. Thus all created things are born. 4 Everything born, Arjuna, comes from the womb of prakriti, and I am the seed-giving father. 3  It is the three gunas born of prakriti  sattva, rajas, and tamas  that bind the immortal Self to the body. 6 Sattva  pure, luminous, and free from sorrow  binds us with attachment to happiness and wisdom. 7 Rajas is passion, arising from selfish desire and attachment. These bind the Self with compulsive action. 8 Tamas, born of ignorance, deludes all creatures through heedlessness, indolence, and sleep. 5  Sattva binds us to happiness; rajas binds us to action. Tamas, distorting our understanding, binds us to delusion. 9  Sattva predominates when rajas and tamas are transformed. Rajas prevails when sattva is weak and tamas overcome. Tamas prevails when rajas and sattva are dormant. 10  When sattva predominates, the light of wisdom shines through every gate of the body. 12 When rajas predominates, a person runs about pursuing selfish and greedy ends, driven by restlessness and 11  \\x0cdesire. 13 When tamas is dominant a person lives in darkness  slothful, confused, and easily infatuated. Those dying in the state of sattva attain the pure worlds of the wise. 15 Those dying in rajas are reborn among people driven by work. But those who die in tamas are conceived in the wombs of the ignorant. 14  The fruit of good deeds is pure and sattvic. The fruit of rajas is suffering. The fruit of tamas is ignorance and insensitivity. 16  From sattva comes understanding; from rajas, greed. But the outcome of tamas is confusion, infatuation, and ignorance. 17  Those who live in sattva go upwards; those in rajas remain where they are. But those immersed in tamas sink downwards. 18  The wise see clearly that all action is the work of the gunas. Knowing that which is above the gunas, they enter into union with me. 19  Going beyond the three gunas which form the body, they leave behind the cycle of birth and death, decrepitude and sorrow, and attain to immortality. 20  ARJUNA  What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the gunas, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the gunas hold? 21  KRISHNA  They are unmoved by the harmony of sattva, the activity of rajas, or the delusion of tamas. They feel no aversion when these forces are active, nor do they crave for them when these forces subside. 22  They remain impartial, undisturbed by the actions of the gunas. Knowing that it is the gunas which act, they abide within 23  \\x0cthemselves and do not vacillate. Established within themselves, they are equal in pleasure and pain, praise and blame, kindness and unkindness. Clay, a rock, and gold are the same to them. 25 Alike in honor and dishonor, alike to friend and foe, they have given up every selfish pursuit. Such are those who have gone beyond the gunas. 24  By serving me with steadfast love, a man or woman goes beyond the gunas. Such a one is fit for union with Brahman. 27 For I am the support of Brahman, the eternal, the unchanging, the deathless, the everlasting dharma, the source of all joy. 26  \\x0c']\n",

On this tree grow the scriptures; seeing their source, one knows their essence. 1  Nourished by the gunas, the limbs of this tree spread above and below. Sense objects grow on the limbs as buds; the roots hanging down bind us to action in this world. 2  The true form of this tree  its essence, beginning, and end  is not perceived on this earth. Cut down this strong-rooted tree with the sharp ax of detachment; 4 then find the path which does not come back again. Seek That, the First Cause, from which the universe came long ago. 3  Not deluded by pride, free from selfish attachment and selfish desire, beyond the duality of pleasure and pain, ever aware of the Self, the wise go forward to that eternal goal. 6 Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire can add to that light. This is my supreme abode, and those who enter there do not return to separate existence. 5  An eternal part of me enters into the world, assuming the powers of action and perception and a mind made of prakriti. 8 When the divine Self enters and leaves a body, it takes these along as the wind carries a scent from place to place. 9 Using the mind, ears, eyes, nose, and the senses of taste and touch, the Self enjoys sense objects. 7  \\x0cThe deluded do not see the Self when it leaves the body or when it dwells within it. They do not see the Self enjoying sense objects or acting through the gunas. But they who have the eye of wisdom see. 10  Those who strive resolutely on the path of yoga see the Self within. The thoughtless, who strive imperfectly, do not. 11  The brightness of the sun, which lights up the world, the brightness of the moon and of fire  these are my glory. 13 With a drop of my energy I enter the earth and support all creatures. Through the moon, the vessel of life-giving fluid, I nourish all plants. 14 I enter breathing creatures and dwell within as the lifegiving breath. I am the fire in the stomach which digests all food. 12  Entering into every heart, I give the power to remember and understand; it is I again who take that power away. All the scriptures lead to me; I am their author and their wisdom. 15  In this world there are two orders of being: the perishable, separate creature and the changeless spirit. 17 But beyond these there is another, the supreme Self, the eternal Lord, who enters into the entire cosmos and supports it from within. 16  I am that supreme Self, praised by the scriptures as beyond the changing and the changeless. 19 Those who see in me that supreme Self see truly. They have found the source of all wisdom, Arjuna, and they worship me with all their heart. 18  I have shared this profound truth with you, Arjuna.

Be self-controlled, sincere, truthful, loving, and full of the desire to serve.

Then, Arjuna, you will achieve your divine destiny. 1  Other qualities, Arjuna, make a person more and more inhuman: hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty, ignorance. 4  The divine qualities lead to freedom; the demonic, to bondage. But do not grieve, Arjuna; you were born with divine attributes. 5  Some people have divine tendencies, others demonic. I have described the divine at length, Arjuna; now listen while I describe the demonic. 6  The demonic do things they should avoid and avoid the things they should do. They have no sense of uprightness, purity, or truth. 7  There is no God, they say, no truth, no spiritual law, no moral order. The basis of life is sex; what else can it be? 9 Holding such distorted views, possessing scant discrimination, they become enemies of the world, causing suffering and destruction. 8  \\x0cHypocritical, proud, and arrogant, living in delusion and clinging to deluded ideas, insatiable in their desires, they pursue their unclean ends. 11 Although burdened with fears that end only with death, they still maintain with complete assurance, Gratification of lust is the highest that life can offer. 10  Bound on all sides by scheming and anxiety, driven by anger and greed, they amass by any means they can a hoard of money for the satisfaction of their cravings. 12  I got this today, they say; tomorrow I shall get that. This wealth is mine, and that will be mine too. 14 I have destroyed my enemies. I shall destroy others too! Am I not like God? I enjoy what I want. I am successful. I am powerful. I am happy. 15 I am rich and well-born. Who is equal to me? I will perform sacrifices and give gifts, and rejoice in my own generosity. This is how they go on, deluded by ignorance. 16 Bound by their greed and entangled in a web of delusion, whirled about by a fragmented mind, they fall into a dark hell. 13  Self-important, obstinate, swept away by the pride of wealth, they ostentatiously perform sacrifices without any regard for their purpose. 18 Egotistical, violent, arrogant, lustful, angry, envious of everyone, they abuse my presence within their own bodies and in the bodies of others. 17  Life after life I cast those who are malicious, hateful, cruel, and degraded into the wombs of those with similar demonic natures. 20 Birth after birth they find themselves with demonic tendencies. Degraded in this way, Arjuna, they fail to reach me and fall lower still. 19  There are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and greed. Renounce these three. 22 Those who escape from these three gates of darkness, Arjuna, seek what is best and attain lifes supreme goal. 23 Others disregard the teachings of the scriptures.

Do they act from sattva, rajas, or tamas? 1  KRISHNA  Every creature is born with faith of some kind, either sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. Listen, and I will describe each to you. 2  Our faith conforms to our nature, Arjuna. Human nature is made of faith. A person is what his shraddha is. 3  Those who are sattvic worship the forms of God; those who are rajasic worship power and wealth. Those who are tamasic worship spirits and ghosts. 5 Some invent harsh penances. Motivated by hypocrisy and egotism, 6 they torture their innocent bodies and me who dwells within. Blinded by their strength and passion, they act and think like demons. 4  The three kinds of faith express themselves in the habits of those who hold them: in the food they like, the work they do, the disciplines they practice, the gifts they give. Listen, and I will describe their different ways. 7  Sattvic people enjoy food that is mild, tasty, substantial, agreeable, and nourishing, food that promotes health, strength, cheerfulness, and longevity. 9 Rajasic people like food that is salty or bitter, hot, sour, or spicy  food that promotes pain, discomfort, and disease. 10 8  \\x0cTamasic people like overcooked, stale, leftover, and impure food, food that has lost its taste and nutritional value. The sattvic perform sacrifices with their entire mind fixed on the purpose of the sacrifice. Without thought of reward, they follow the teachings of the scriptures. 12 The rajasic perform sacrifices for the sake of show and the good it will bring them. 13 The tamasic perform sacrifices ignoring both the letter and the spirit. They omit the proper prayers, the proper offerings, the proper food, and the proper faith. 11  To offer service to the gods, to the good, to the wise, and to your spiritual teacher; purity, honesty, continence, and nonviolence: these are the disciplines of the body. 15 To offer soothing words, to speak truly, kindly, and helpfully, and to study the scriptures: these are the disciplines of speech. 16 Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind. 14  When these three levels of self-discipline are practiced without attachment to the results, but in a spirit of great faith, the sages call this practice sattvic. 18 Disciplines practiced in order to gain respect, honor, or admiration are rajasic; they are undependable and transitory in their effects. 19 Disciplines practiced to gain power over others, or in the confused belief that to torture oneself is spiritual, are tamasic. 17  Giving simply because it is right to give, without thought of return, at a proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy person, is sattvic giving. 21 Giving with regrets or in the expectation of receiving some favor or of getting something in return is rajasic. 22 Giving at an inappropriate time, in inappropriate circumstances, and to an unworthy person, without affection or respect, is tamasic. 20  Om Tat Sat: these three words represent Brahman, from which come priests and scriptures and sacrifice. 24 Those who follow the Vedas, therefore, always repeat the word Om when offering sacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, or giving gifts. 25 Those seeking liberation and not any personal benefit add the word Tat 23  \\x0cwhen performing these acts of worship, discipline, and charity. 26 Sat means that which is; it also indicates goodness. Therefore it is used to describe a worthy deed. To be steadfast in self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving is sat. To act in accordance with these three is sat as well. 28 But to engage in sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving without good faith is asat, without worth or goodness, either in this life or in the next. 27  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c18: Freedom & Renunciation ARJUNA  O Krishna, destroyer of evil, please explain to me sannyasa and tyaga and how one kind of renunciation differs from another. 1  KRISHNA  To refrain from selfish acts is one kind of renunciation, called sannyasa; to renounce the fruit of action is another, called tyaga. 2  Among the wise, some say that all action should be renounced as evil. Others say that certain kinds of action  self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline  should be continued. 4 Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain three kinds of tyaga and my conclusions concerning them. 3  Self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline should not be renounced, for they purify the thoughtful. 6 Yet even these, Arjuna, should be performed without desire for selfish rewards. This is essential. 5  To renounce ones responsibilities is not fitting. The wise call such deluded renunciation tamasic. 8 To avoid action from fear of difficulty or physical discomfort is rajasic. There is no reward in such renunciation. 9 But to fulfill your responsibilities knowing that they are obligatory, while at the same time desiring nothing for yourself  this is sattvic renunciation. 10 Those endowed with sattva clearly understand the meaning of renunciation and do not waver. They are not intimidated by unpleasant work, nor do they seek a job because it is pleasant. 7  \\x0cAs long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward. 12 Those who are attached to personal reward will reap the consequences of their actions: some pleasant, some unpleasant, some mixed. But those who renounce every desire for personal reward go beyond the reach of karma. 11  Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain the five elements necessary for the accomplishment of every action, as taught by the wisdom of Sankhya. 14 The body, the means, the ego, the performance of the act, and the divine will: 15 these are the five factors in all actions, right or wrong, in thought, word, or deed. 13  Those who do not understand this think of themselves as separate agents. With their crude intellects they fail to see the truth. 17 The person who is free from ego, who has attained purity of heart, though he slays these people, he does not slay and is not bound by his action. 16  Knowledge, the thing to be known, and the knower: these three promote action. The means, the act itself, and the doer: these three are the totality of action. 19 Knowledge, action, and the doer can be described according to the gunas. Listen, and I will explain their distinctions to you. 18  Sattvic knowledge sees the one indestructible Being in all beings, the unity underlying the multiplicity of creation. 21 Rajasic knowledge sees all things and creatures as separate and distinct. 22 Tamasic knowledge, lacking any sense of perspective, sees one small part and mistakes it for the whole. 20  Work performed to fulfill ones obligations, without thought of personal reward or of whether the job is pleasant or unpleasant, is sattvic. 24 Work prompted by selfish desire or self-will, full of stress, is rajasic. 25 Work that is undertaken blindly, without any consideration of consequences, waste, injury to others, or ones own capacities, is tamasic. 23  \\x0cSattvic workers are free from egotism and selfish attachments, full of enthusiasm and fortitude in success and failure alike. 27 Rajasic workers have strong personal desires and crave rewards for their actions. Covetous, impure, and destructive, they are easily swept away by fortune, good or bad. 28 Tamasic workers are undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, dishonest, and lazy. They are easily depressed and prone to procrastination. 26  Listen, Arjuna, as I describe the three types of understanding and will. 29  To know when to act and when to refrain from action, what is right action and what is wrong, what brings security and what insecurity, what brings freedom and what bondage: these are the signs of a sattvic intellect. 30  The rajasic intellect confuses right and wrong actions, and cannot distinguish what is to be done from what should not be done. 32 The tamasic intellect is shrouded in darkness, utterly reversing right and wrong wherever it turns. 31  The sattvic will, developed through meditation, keeps prana, mind, and senses in vital harmony. 34 The rajasic will, conditioned by selfish desire, pursues wealth, pleasure, and respectability. 35 The tamasic will shows itself in obstinate ignorance, sloth, fear, grief, depression, and conceit. 33  Now listen, Arjuna: there are also three kinds of happiness. By sustained effort, one comes to the end of sorrow. 37 That which seems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end  this is the joy of sattva, born of a mind at peace with itself. 38 Pleasure from the senses seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter as poison in the end. This is the kind of happiness that comes to the rajasic. 39 Those who are tamasic draw their pleasures from sleep, indolence, and intoxication. Both in the beginning and in the end, this happiness is a delusion. 36  \\x0cNo creature, whether born on earth or among the gods in heaven, is free from the conditioning of the three gunas. 41 The different responsibilities found in the social order  distinguishing brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra  have their roots in this conditioning. 40  The responsibilities to which brahmins are born, based on their nature, are self-control, tranquility, purity of heart, patience, humility, learning, austerity, wisdom, and faith. 42  The qualities of kshatriyas, based on their nature, are courage, strength, fortitude, dexterity, generosity, leadership, and the firm resolve never to retreat from battle. 44 The occupations suitable for a vaishya are agriculture, dairying, and trade. The proper work of a shudra is service. 43  By devotion to ones own particular duty, everyone can attain perfection. Let me tell you how. 46 By performing ones own work, one worships the Creator who dwells in every creature. Such worship brings that person to fulfillment. 45  It is better to perform ones own duties imperfectly than to master the duties of another. By fulfilling the obligations he is born with, a person never comes to grief. 48 No one should abandon duties because he sees defects in them. Every action, every activity, is surrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke. 47  One who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action. 50 Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom. 49  Unerring in discrimination, sovereign of the senses and passions, free from the clamor of likes and dislikes, 52 such a one leads a simple, self-reliant life based on meditation, controlling speech, body, and mind. 51  \\x0cFree from self-will, aggressiveness, arrogance, anger, and the lust to possess people or things, they are at peace with themselves and others and enter into the unitive state. 54 United with Brahman, ever joyful, beyond the reach of desire and sorrow, they have equal regard for every living creature and attain supreme devotion to me. 55 By loving me they come to know me truly; then they know my glory and enter into my boundless being. 56 All their acts are performed in my service, and through my grace they win eternal life. 53  Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always. 58 Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. 57  If you egotistically say, I will not fight this battle, your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. 60 Your own karma, born of your own nature, will drive you to do even that which you do not wish to do, because of your delusion. 59  The Lord dwells in the hearts of all creatures and whirls them round upon the wheel of maya. 62 Run to him for refuge with all your strength, and peace profound will be yours through his grace. 61  I give you these precious words of wisdom; reflect on them and then do as you choose. 64 These are the last words I shall speak to you, dear one, for your spiritual fulfillment. You are very dear to me. 63  Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me. 66 Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve. 65  Do not share this wisdom with anyone who lacks in devotion or self-control, lacks the desire to learn, or scoffs at me. 68 Those who teach this supreme mystery of the Gita to all who love me perform 67  \\x0cthe greatest act of love; they will come to me without doubt. 69 No one can render me more devoted service; no one on earth can be more dear to me. Those who meditate on these holy words worship me with wisdom and devotion. 71 Even those who listen to them with faith, free from doubts, will find a happier world where good people dwell. 70  Have you listened with attention? Are you now free from your doubts and confusion? 72  ARJUNA  You have dispelled my doubts and delusions, and I understand through your grace. My faith is firm now, and I will do your will. 73  SANJAYA  This is the dialogue I heard between Krishna, the son of Vasudeva, and Arjuna, the great-hearted son of Pritha. The wonder of it makes my hair stand on end! 75 Through Vyasas grace, I have heard the supreme secret of spiritual union directly from the Lord of Yoga, Krishna himself. 74  Whenever I remember these wonderful, holy words between Krishna and Arjuna, I am filled with joy. 77 And when I remember the breathtaking form of Krishna, I am filled with wonder and my joy overflows. 76  Wherever the divine Krishna and the mighty Arjuna are, there will be prosperity, victory, happiness, and sound judgment. Of this I am sure! 78  \\x0c']\n"

            "['   \\x0c1: The War Within DHRITARASHTRA  O Sanjaya, tell me what happened at Kurukshetra, the field of dharma, where my family and the Pandavas gathered to fight. 1  SANJAYA  Having surveyed the forces of the Pandavas arrayed for battle, prince Duryodhana approached his teacher, Drona, and spoke. 3 O my teacher, look at this mighty army of the Pandavas, assembled by your own gifted disciple, Yudhishthira. 4 There are heroic warriors and great archers who are the equals of Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana, Virata, the mighty Drupada, 5 Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja,the great leader Shaibya, 6 the powerful Yudhamanyu, the valiant Uttamaujas, and the son of Subhadra, in addition to the sons of Draupadi. All these command mighty chariots. 2  O best of brahmins, listen to the names of those who are distinguished among our own forces: 8 Bhishma, Karna, and the victorious Kripa; Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta. 7  There are many others, too, heroes giving up their lives for my sake, all proficient in war and armed with a variety of weapons. 10 Our army is unlimited and commanded by Bhishma; theirs is small and commanded by Bhima. 11 Let everyone take his proper place and stand firm supporting Bhishma! 9  Then the powerful Bhishma, the grandsire, oldest of all the Kurus, in order to cheer Duryodhana, roared like a lion and blew his 12  \\x0cconch horn. 13 And after Bhishma, a tremendous noise arose of conchs and cow horns and pounding on drums. Then Sri Krishna and Arjuna, who were standing in a mighty chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conchs. 15 Sri Krishna blew the conch named Panchajanya, and Arjuna blew that called Devadatta. The mighty Bhima blew the huge conch Paundra. 16 Yudhishthira, the king, the son of Kunti, blew the conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conchs as well. 17 Then the king of Kashi, the leading bowman, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the invincible Satyaki, 18 Drupada, all the sons of Draupadi, and the strong-armed son of Subhadra joined in, 19 and the noise tore through the heart of Duryodhanas army. Indeed, the sound was tumultuous, echoing throughout heaven and earth. 14  Then, O Dhritarashtra, lord of the earth, having seen your sons forces set in their places and the fighting about to begin, Arjuna spoke these words to Sri Krishna: 20  ARJUNA  O Krishna, drive my chariot between the two armies. 22 I want to see those who desire to fight with me. With whom will this battle be fought? 23 I want to see those assembled to fight for Duryodhana, those who seek to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra by engaging in war. 21  SANJAYA  Thus Arjuna spoke, and Sri Krishna, driving his splendid chariot between the two armies, 25 facing Bhishma and Drona and all the kings of the earth, said: Arjuna, behold all the Kurus gathered together. 24  And Arjuna, standing between the two armies, saw fathers and grandfathers, teachers, uncles, and brothers, sons and grandsons, 27 in-laws and friends. Seeing his kinsmen established in opposition, 28 Arjuna was overcome by sorrow. Despairing, he spoke these words: 26  \\x0cARJUNA  O Krishna, I see my own relations here anxious to fight, 29 and my limbs grow weak; my mouth is dry, my body shakes, and my hair is standing on end. 30 My skin burns, and the bow Gandiva has slipped from my hand. I am unable to stand; my mind seems to be whirling. 31 These signs bode evil for us. I do not see that any good can come from killing our relations in battle. 32 O Krishna, I have no desire for victory, or for a kingdom or pleasures. Of what use is a kingdom or pleasure or even life, 33 if those for whose sake we desire these things  34 teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, in-laws, grandsons, and others with family ties  are engaging in this battle, renouncing their wealth and their lives? 35 Even if they were to kill me, I would not want to kill them, not even to become ruler of the three worlds. How much less for the earth alone? O Krishna, what satisfaction could we find in killing Dhritarashtras sons? We would become sinners by slaying these men, even though they are evil. 37 The sons of Dhritarashtra are related to us; therefore, we should not kill them. How can we gain happiness by killing members of our own family? 36  Though they are overpowered by greed and see no evil in destroying families or injuring friends, we see these evils. 39 Why shouldnt we turn away from this sin? 40 When a family declines, ancient traditions are destroyed. With them are lost the spiritual foundations for life, and the family loses its sense of unity. 41 Where there is no sense of unity, the women of the family become corrupt; and with the corruption of its women, society is plunged into chaos. 42 Social chaos is hell for the family and for those who have destroyed the family as well. It disrupts the process of spiritual evolution begun by our ancestors. 43 The timeless spiritual foundations of family and society would be destroyed by these terrible deeds, which violate the unity of life. 38  It is said that those whose family dharma has been destroyed dwell in hell. 45 This is a great sin! We are prepared to kill our own relations out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. 46 Better for 44  \\x0cme if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, were to attack me in battle and kill me unarmed and unresisting. SANJAYA  Overwhelmed by sorrow, Arjuna spoke these words. And casting away his bow and his arrows, he sat down in his chariot in the middle of the battlefield. 47  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c2: Self-Realization SANJAYA  These are the words that Sri Krishna spoke to the despairing Arjuna, whose eyes were burning with tears of pity and confusion. 1  KRISHNA  This despair and weakness in a time of crisis are mean and unworthy of you, Arjuna. How have you fallen into a state so far from the path to liberation? 3 It does not become you to yield to this weakness. Arise with a brave heart and destroy the enemy. 2  ARJUNA  How can I ever bring myself to fight against Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of reverence? How can I, Krishna? 5 Surely it would be better to spend my life begging than to kill these great and worthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would be tainted. 6 I dont even know which would be better, for us to conquer them or for them to conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashtra have confronted us; but why would we care to live if we killed them? 4  My will is paralyzed, and I am utterly confused. Tell me which is the better path for me. Let me be your disciple. I have fallen at your feet; give me instruction. 8 What can overcome a sorrow that saps all my vitality? Even power over men and gods or the wealth of an empire seem empty. 7  SANJAYA  \\x0cThis is how Arjuna, the great warrior, spoke to Sri Krishna. With the words, O Krishna, I will not fight, he fell silent. 10 As they stood between the two armies, Sri Krishna smiled and replied to Arjuna, who had sunk into despair. 9  KRISHNA  You speak sincerely, but your sorrow has no cause. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. 12 There has never been a time when you and I and the kings gathered here have not existed, nor will there be a time when we will cease to exist. 13 As the same person inhabits the body through childhood, youth, and old age, so too at the time of death he attains another body. The wise are not deluded by these changes. 11  When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. 15 Those who are unaffected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. Assert your strength and realize this! 14  The impermanent has no reality; reality lies in the eternal. Those who have seen the boundary between these two have attained the end of all knowledge. 17 Realize that which pervades the universe and is indestructible; no power can affect this unchanging, imperishable reality. 18 The body is mortal, but that which dwells in the body is immortal and immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, fight in this battle. 16  One believes he is the slayer, another believes he is the slain. Both are ignorant; there is neither slayer nor slain. 20 You were never born; you will never die. You have never changed; you can never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, you do not die when the body dies. 21 Realizing that which is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and unchanging, how can you slay or cause another to slay? 19  \\x0cAs one abandons worn-out clothes and acquires new ones, so when the body is worn out a new one is acquired by the Self, who lives within. 22  The Self cannot be pierced by weapons or burned by fire; water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it. 24 The Self cannot be pierced or burned, made wet or dry. It is everlasting and infinite, standing on the motionless foundations of eternity. 25 The Self is unmanifested, beyond all thought, beyond all change. Knowing this, you should not grieve. 23  O mighty Arjuna, even if you believe the Self to be subject to birth and death, you should not grieve. 27 Death is inevitable for the living; birth is inevitable for the dead. Since these are unavoidable, you should not sorrow. 28 Every creature is unmanifested at first and then attains manifestation. When its end has come, it once again becomes unmanifested. What is there to lament in this? 26  The glory of the Self is beheld by a few, and a few describe it; a few listen, but many without understanding. 30 The Self of all beings, living within the body, is eternal and cannot be harmed. Therefore, do not grieve. 29  Considering your dharma, you should not vacillate. For a warrior, nothing is higher than a war against evil. 32 The warrior confronted with such a war should be pleased, Arjuna, for it comes as an open gate to heaven. 33 But if you do not participate in this battle against evil, you will incur sin, violating your dharma and your honor. 31  The story of your dishonor will be repeated endlessly: and for a man of honor, dishonor is worse than death. 35 These brave warriors will think you have withdrawn from battle out of fear, and those who formerly esteemed you will treat you with disrespect. 36 Your enemies will ridicule your strength and say things that should not be said. What could be more painful than this? 34  Death means the attainment of heaven; victory means the enjoyment of the earth. Therefore rise up, Arjuna, resolved to fight! 37  \\x0cHaving made yourself alike in pain and pleasure, profit and loss, victory and defeat, engage in this great battle and you will be freed from sin. 38  You have heard the intellectual explanation of Sankhya, Arjuna; now listen to the principles of yoga. By practicing these you can break through the bonds of karma. 40 On this path effort never goes to waste, and there is no failure. Even a little effort toward spiritual awareness will protect you from the greatest fear. 39  Those who follow this path, resolving deep within themselves to seek me alone, attain singleness of purpose. For those who lack resolution, the decisions of life are many-branched and endless. 41  There are ignorant people who speak flowery words and take delight in the letter of the law, saying that there is nothing else. 43 Their hearts are full of selfish desires, Arjuna. Their idea of heaven is their own enjoyment, and the aim of all their activities is pleasure and power. The fruit of their actions is continual rebirth. 44 Those whose minds are swept away by the pursuit of pleasure and power are incapable of following the supreme goal and will not attain samadhi. 42  The scriptures describe the three gunas. But you should be free from the action of the gunas, established in eternal truth, selfcontrolled, without any sense of duality or the desire to acquire and hoard. 45  Just as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is flooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined man or woman, who sees the Lord everywhere. 46  You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. 48 Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself  without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. 47  \\x0cSeek refuge in the attitude of detachment and you will amass the wealth of spiritual awareness. Those who are motivated only by desire for the fruits of action are miserable, for they are constantly anxious about the results of what they do. 50 When consciousness is unified, however, all vain anxiety is left behind. There is no cause for worry, whether things go well or ill. Therefore, devote yourself to the disciplines of yoga, for yoga is skill in action. 49  The wise unify their consciousness and abandon attachment to the fruits of action, which binds a person to continual rebirth. Thus they attain a state beyond all evil. 51  When your mind has overcome the confusion of duality, you will attain the state of holy indifference to things you hear and things you have heard. 53 When you are unmoved by the confusion of ideas and your mind is completely united in deep samadhi, you will attain the state of perfect yoga. 52  ARJUNA  Tell me of those who live established in wisdom, ever aware of the Self, O Krishna. How do they talk? How sit? How move about? 54  KRISHNA  They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them, who have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving tormenting the heart. 55  Neither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live free from lust and fear and anger. Established in meditation, they are truly wise. 57 Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are neither elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. Such are the seers. 56  Even as a tortoise draws in its limbs, the wise can draw in their senses at will. 59 Aspirants abstain from sense pleasures, but they still crave for them. These cravings all disappear when they see the highest goal. 60 Even of those who tread the path, the stormy senses 58  \\x0ccan sweep off the mind. 61 They live in wisdom who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in me. When you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. 63 Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste. 64 But when you move amidst the world of sense, free from attachment and aversion alike, 65 there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you live in the wisdom of the Self. 62  The disunited mind is far from wise; how can it meditate? How be at peace? When you know no peace, how can you know joy? 67 When you let your mind follow the call of the senses, they carry away your better judgment as storms drive a boat off its charted course on the sea. 66  Use all your power to free the senses from attachment and aversion alike, and live in the full wisdom of the Self. 69 Such a sage awakes to light in the night of all creatures. That which the world calls day is the night of ignorance to the wise. 68  As rivers flow into the ocean but cannot make the vast ocean overflow, so flow the streams of the sense-world into the sea of peace that is the sage. But this is not so with the desirer of desires. 70  They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away from the ego-cage of I, me, and mine to be united with the Lord. 72 This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality. 71  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c3: Selfless Service ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have said that knowledge is greater than action; why then do you ask me to wage this terrible war? 2 Your advice seems inconsistent. Give me one path to follow to the supreme good. 1  KRISHNA  At the beginning of time I declared two paths for the pure heart: jnana yoga, the contemplative path of spiritual wisdom, and karma yoga, the active path of selfless service. 3  One who shirks action does not attain freedom; no one can gain perfection by abstaining from work. 5 Indeed, there is no one who rests for even an instant; all creatures are driven to action by their own nature. 4  Those who abstain from action while allowing the mind to dwell on sensual pleasure cannot be called sincere spiritual aspirants. 7 But they excel who control their senses through the mind, using them for selfless service. 6  Fulfill all your duties; action is better than inaction. Even to maintain your body, Arjuna, you are obliged to act. 9 Selfish action imprisons the world. Act selflessly, without any thought of personal profit. 8  At the beginning, mankind and the obligation of selfless service were created together. Through selfless service, you will always be 10  \\x0cfruitful and find the fulfillment of your desires: this is the promise of the Creator. Honor and cherish the devas as they honor and cherish you; through this honor and love you will attain the supreme good. 12 All human desires are fulfilled by the devas, who are pleased by selfless service. But anyone who enjoys the things given by the devas without offering selfless acts in return is a thief. 11  The spiritually minded, who eat in the spirit of service, are freed from all their sins; but the selfish, who prepare food for their own satisfaction, eat sin. 14 Living creatures are nourished by food, and food is nourished by rain; rain itself is the water of life, which comes from selfless worship and service. 13  Every selfless act, Arjuna, is born from Brahman, the eternal, infinite Godhead. Brahman is present in every act of service. 16 All life turns on this law, O Arjuna. Those who violate it, indulging the senses for their own pleasure and ignoring the needs of others, have wasted their life. 17 But those who realize the Self are always satisfied. Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no longer seek happiness from the external world. 18 They have nothing to gain or lose by any action; neither people nor things can affect their security. 15  Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. 20 Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path. 19  What the outstanding person does, others will try to do. The standards such people create will be followed by the whole world. 22 There is nothing in the three worlds for me to gain, Arjuna, nor is there anything I do not have; I continue to act, but I am not driven by any need of my own. 23 If I ever refrained from continuous work, everyone would immediately follow my example. 24 If I stopped working I would be the cause of cosmic chaos, and finally of the destruction of this world and these people. 21  \\x0cThe ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare of the world, without thought for themselves. 26 By abstaining from work you will confuse the ignorant, who are engrossed in their actions. Perform all work carefully, guided by compassion. 25  All actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti. Deluded by identification with the ego, a person thinks, I am the doer. 28 But the illumined man or woman understands the domain of the gunas and is not attached. Such people know that the gunas interact with each other; they do not claim to be the doer. 27  Those who are deluded by the operation of the gunas become attached to the results of their action. Those who understand these truths should not unsettle the ignorant. 30 Performing all actions for my sake, completely absorbed in the Self, and without expectations, fight!  but stay free from the fever of the ego. 29  Those who live in accordance with these divine laws without complaining, firmly established in faith, are released from karma. 32 Those who violate these laws, criticizing and complaining, are utterly deluded, and are the cause of their own suffering. 31  Even the wise act within the limitations of their own nature. Every creature is subject to prakriti; what is the use of repression? 34 The senses have been conditioned by attraction to the pleasant and aversion to the unpleasant. Do not be ruled by them; they are obstacles in your path. 33  It is better to strive in ones own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following ones own dharma, but competition in anothers dharma breeds fear and insecurity. 35  ARJUNA  What is the force that binds us to selfish deeds, O Krishna? What power moves us, even against our will, as if forcing us? 36  \\x0cKRISHNA  It is selfish desire and anger, arising from the guna of rajas; these are the appetites and evils which threaten a person in this life. 37  Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, just as the embryo rests deep within the womb, knowledge is hidden by selfish desire  39 hidden, Arjuna, by this unquenchable fire for self-satisfaction, the inveterate enemy of the wise. 38  Selfish desire is found in the senses, mind, and intellect, misleading them and burying the understanding in delusion. 41 Fight with all your strength, Arjuna! Controlling your senses, conquer your enemy, the destroyer of knowledge and realization. 40  The senses are higher than the body, the mind higher than the senses; above the mind is the intellect, and above the intellect is the Atman. 43 Thus, knowing that which is supreme, let the Atman rule the ego. Use your mighty arms to slay the fierce enemy that is selfish desire. 42  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c4: Wisdom in Action KRISHNA  I told this eternal secret to Vivasvat. Vivasvat taught Manu, and Manu taught Ikshvaku. 2 Thus, Arjuna, eminent sages received knowledge of yoga in a continuous tradition. But through time the practice of yoga was lost in the world. 1  The secret of these teachings is profound. I have explained them to you today because you are my friend and devotee. 3  ARJUNA  You were born much after Vivasvat; he lived very long ago. Why do you say that you taught this yoga in the beginning? 4  KRISHNA  You and I have passed through many births, Arjuna. You have forgotten, but I remember them all. 5  My true being is unborn and changeless. I am the Lord who dwells in every creature. Through the power of my own maya, I manifest myself in a finite form. 6  Whenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I manifest myself on earth. 8 I am born in every age to protect the good, to destroy evil, and to reestablish dharma. 7  Those who know me as their own divine Self break through the belief that they are the body and are not reborn as separate creatures. Such a one, Arjuna, is united with me. 10 Delivered from selfish 9  \\x0cattachment, fear, and anger, filled with me, surrendering themselves to me, purified in the fire of my being, many have reached the state of unity in me. As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. 11  Those desiring success in their actions worship the gods; through action in the world of mortals, their desires are quickly fulfilled. 13 The distinctions of caste, guna, and karma have come from me. I am their cause, but I myself am changeless and beyond all action. 14 Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results. Those who understand this and practice it live in freedom. 15 Knowing this truth, aspirants desiring liberation in ancient times engaged in action. You too can do the same, pursuing an active life in the manner of those ancient sages. 12  What is action and what is inaction? This question has confused the greatest sages. I will give you the secret of action, with which you can free yourself from bondage. 17 The true nature of action is difficult to grasp. You must understand what is action and what is inaction, and what kind of action should be avoided. 16  The wise see that there is action in the midst of inaction and inaction in the midst of action. Their consciousness is unified, and every act is done with complete awareness. 18  The awakened sages call a person wise when all his undertakings are free from anxiety about results; all his selfish desires have been consumed in the fire of knowledge. 20 The wise, ever satisfied, have abandoned all external supports. Their security is unaffected by the results of their action; even while acting, they really do nothing at all. 21 Free from expectations and from all sense of possession, with mind and body firmly controlled by the Self, they do not incur sin by the performance of physical action. 19  They live in freedom who have gone beyond the dualities of life. Competing with no one, they are alike in success and failure and 22  \\x0ccontent with whatever comes to them. 23 They are free, without selfish attachments; their minds are fixed in knowledge. They perform all work in the spirit of service, and their karma is dissolved. The process of offering is Brahman; that which is offered is Brahman. Brahman offers the sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. Brahman is attained by those who see Brahman in every action. 24  Some aspirants offer material sacrifices to the gods. Others offer selfless service as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. 26 Some renounce all enjoyment of the senses, sacrificing them in the fire of sense restraint. Others partake of sense objects but offer them in service through the fire of the senses. 27 Some offer the workings of the senses and the vital forces through the fire of self-control, kindled in the path of knowledge. 25  Some offer wealth; others offer sense restraint and suffering. Some take vows and offer knowledge and study of the scriptures; and some make the offering of meditation. 29 Some offer the forces of vitality, regulating their inhalation and exhalation, and thus gain control over these forces. 30 Others offer the forces of vitality through restraint of their senses. All these understand the meaning of service and will be cleansed of their impurities. 28  True sustenance is in service, and through it a man or woman reaches the eternal Brahman. But those who do not seek to serve are without a home in this world. Arjuna, how can they be at home in any world to come? 31  These offerings are born of work, and each guides mankind along a path to Brahman. Understanding this, you will attain liberation. 33 The offering of wisdom is better than any material offering, Arjuna; for the goal of all work is spiritual wisdom. 32  Approach those who have realized the purpose of life and question them with reverence and devotion; they will instruct you in 34  \\x0cthis wisdom. 35 Once you attain it, you will never again be deluded. You will see all creatures in the Self, and all in me. Even if you were the most sinful of sinners, Arjuna, you could cross beyond all sin by the raft of spiritual wisdom. 37 As the heat of a fire reduces wood to ashes, the fire of knowledge burns to ashes all karma. 38 Nothing in this world purifies like spiritual wisdom. It is the perfection achieved in time through the path of yoga, the path which leads to the Self within. 36  Those who take wisdom as their highest goal, whose faith is deep and whose senses are trained, attain wisdom quickly and enter into perfect peace. 40 But the ignorant, indecisive and lacking in faith, waste their lives. They can never be happy in this world or any other. 39  Those established in the Self have renounced selfish attachments to their actions and cut through doubts with spiritual wisdom. They act in freedom. 42 Arjuna, cut through this doubt in your own heart with the sword of spiritual wisdom. Arise; take up the path of yoga! 41  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c5: Renounce & Rejoice ARJUNA  O Krishna, you have recommended both the path of selfless action and sannyasa, the path of renunciation of action. Tell me definitely which is better. 1  KRISHNA  Both renunciation of action and the selfless performance of action lead to the supreme goal. But the path of action is better than renunciation. 2  Those who have attained perfect renunciation are free from any sense of duality; they are unaffected by likes and dislikes, Arjuna, and are free from the bondage of self-will. 4 The immature think that knowledge and action are different, but the wise see them as the same. The person who is established in one path will attain the rewards of both. 5 The goal of knowledge and the goal of service are the same; those who fail to see this are blind. 3  Perfect renunciation is difficult to attain without performing action. But the wise, following the path of selfless service, quickly reach Brahman. 6  Those who follow the path of service, who have completely purified themselves and conquered their senses and self-will, see the Self in all creatures and are untouched by any action they perform. 7  Those who know this truth, whose consciousness is unified, think always, I am not the doer. While seeing or hearing, touching or 8  \\x0csmelling; eating, moving about, or sleeping; breathing 9 or speaking, letting go or holding on, even opening or closing the eyes, they understand that these are only the movements of the senses among sense objects. Those who surrender to Brahman all selfish attachments are like the leaf of a lotus floating clean and dry in water. Sin cannot touch them. 11 Renouncing their selfish attachments, those who follow the path of service work with body, senses, and mind for the sake of self-purification. 10  Those whose consciousness is unified abandon all attachment to the results of action and attain supreme peace. But those whose desires are fragmented, who are selfishly attached to the results of their work, are bound in everything they do. 12  Those who renounce attachment in all their deeds live content in the city of nine gates, the body, as its master. They are not driven to act, nor do they involve others in action. 13  Neither the sense of acting, nor actions, nor the connection of cause and effect comes from the Lord of this world. These three arise from nature. 14  The Lord does not partake in the good and evil deeds of any person; judgment is clouded when wisdom is obscured by ignorance. 16 But ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self within. The light of this knowledge shines like the sun, revealing the supreme Brahman. 17 Those who cast off sin through this knowledge, absorbed in the Lord and established in him as their one goal and refuge, are not reborn as separate creatures. 15  Those who possess this wisdom have equal regard for all. They see the same Self in a spiritual aspirant and an outcaste, in an elephant, a cow, and a dog. 19 Such people have mastered life. With even mind they rest in Brahman, who is perfect and is everywhere the same. 20 They are not elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. With mind established in Brahman, they are free from delusion. 18  \\x0cNot dependent on any external support, they realize the joy of spiritual awareness. With consciousness unified through meditation, they live in abiding joy. 21  Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses have a beginning and an end and give birth to misery, Arjuna. The wise do not look for happiness in them. 23 But those who overcome the impulses of lust and anger which arise in the body are made whole and live in joy. 24 They find their joy, their rest, and their light completely within themselves. United with the Lord, they attain nirvana in Brahman. 22  Healed of their sins and conflicts, working for the good of all beings, the holy sages attain nirvana in Brahman. 26 Free from anger and selfish desire, unified in mind, those who follow the path of yoga and realize the Self are established forever in that supreme state. 25  Closing their eyes, steadying their breathing, and focusing their attention on the center of spiritual consciousness, 28 the wise master their senses, mind, and intellect through meditation. Self-realization is their only goal. Freed from selfish desire, fear, and anger, they live in freedom always. 29 Knowing me as the friend of all creatures, the Lord of the universe, the end of all offerings and all spiritual disciplines, they attain eternal peace. 27  \\x0c']\n",
            "[' The general Hindu belief is that Self-realization requires many, many lives of spiritual discipline.   \\x0c6: Practice of Meditation KRISHNA  It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those who work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of meditation. Theirs is true renunciation. 2 Therefore, Arjuna, you should understand that renunciation and the performance of selfless service are the same. Those who cannot renounce attachment to the results of their work are far from the path. 1  For aspirants who want to climb the mountain of spiritual awareness, the path is selfless work; for those who have ascended to yoga the path is stillness and peace. 4 When a person has freed himself from attachment to the results of work, and from desires for the enjoyment of sense objects, he ascends to the unitive state. 3  Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. 5  To those who have conquered themselves, the will is a friend. But it is the enemy of those who have not found the Self within them. 6  The supreme Reality stands revealed in the consciousness of those who have conquered themselves. They live in peace, alike in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. 7  They are completely fulfilled by spiritual wisdom and Selfrealization. Having conquered their senses, they have climbed to the summit of human consciousness. To such people a clod of dirt, a stone, and gold are the same. 9 They are equally disposed to family, 8  \\x0cenemies, and friends, to those who support them and those who are hostile, to the good and the evil alike. Because they are impartial, they rise to great heights. Those who aspire to the state of yoga should seek the Self in inner solitude through meditation. With body and mind controlled they should constantly practice one-pointedness, free from expectations and attachment to material possessions. 10  Select a clean spot, neither too high nor too low, and seat yourself firmly on a cloth, a deerskin, and kusha grass. 12 Then, once seated, strive to still your thoughts. Make your mind one-pointed in meditation, and your heart will be purified. 13 Hold your body, head, and neck firmly in a straight line, and keep your eyes from wandering. 14 With all fears dissolved in the peace of the Self and all desires dedicated to Brahman, controlling the mind and fixing it on me, sit in meditation with me as your only goal. 15 With senses and mind constantly controlled through meditation, united with the Self within, an aspirant attains nirvana, the state of abiding joy and peace in me. 11  Arjuna, those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too much or sleep too little, will not succeed in meditation. 17 But those who are temperate in eating and sleeping, work and recreation, will come to the end of sorrow through meditation. 18 Through constant effort they learn to withdraw the mind from selfish cravings and absorb it in the Self. Thus they attain the state of union. 16  When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp in a windless place. 20 In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. 21 Having attained that abiding joy beyond the senses, revealed in the stilled mind, he never swerves from the eternal truth. 22 He desires nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow. 19  \\x0cThe practice of meditation frees one from all affliction. This is the path of yoga. Follow it with determination and sustained enthusiasm. 24 Renouncing wholeheartedly all selfish desires and expectations, use your will to control the senses. 25 Little by little, through patience and repeated effort, the mind will become stilled in the Self. 23  Wherever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for satisfaction without, lead it within; train it to rest in the Self 27 Abiding joy comes to those who still the mind. Freeing themselves from the taint of self-will, with their consciousness unified, they become one with Brahman. 26  The infinite joy of touching Brahman is easily attained by those who are free from the burden of evil and established within themselves. 29 They see the Self in every creature and all creation in the Self. With consciousness unified through meditation, they see everything with an equal eye. 28  I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me. 31 They worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. 30  When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. 32  ARJUNA  O Krishna, the stillness of divine union which you describe is beyond my comprehension. How can the mind, which is so restless, attain lasting peace? 34 Krishna, the mind is restless, turbulent, powerful, violent; trying to control it is like trying to tame the wind. 33  KRISHNA  \\x0cIt is true that the mind is restless and difficult to control. But it can be conquered, Arjuna, through regular practice and detachment. 36 Those who lack self-control will find it difficult to progress in meditation; but those who are self-controlled, striving earnestly through the right means, will attain the goal. 35  ARJUNA  Krishna, what happens to the man who has faith but who lacks self-control and wanders from the path, not attaining success in yoga? 38 If a man becomes deluded on the spiritual path, will he lose the support of both worlds, like a cloud scattered in the sky? 39 Krishna, you can dispel all doubts; remove this doubt which binds me. 37  KRISHNA  Arjuna, my son, such a person will not be destroyed. No one who does good work will ever come to a bad end, either here or in the world to come. 40  When such people die, they go to other realms where the righteous live. They dwell there for countless years and then are reborn into a home which is pure and prosperous. 42 Or they may be born into a family where meditation is practiced; to be born into such a family is extremely rare. 43 The wisdom they have acquired in previous lives will be reawakened, Arjuna, and they will strive even harder for Self-realization. 44 Indeed, they will be driven on by the strength of their past disciplines. Even one who inquires after the practice of meditation rises above those who simply perform rituals. 41  Through constant effort over many lifetimes, a person becomes purified of all selfish desires and attains the supreme goal of life. 45  Meditation is superior to severe asceticism and the path of knowledge. It is also superior to selfless service. May you attain the goal of meditation, Arjuna! 47 Even among those who meditate, that 46  \\x0cman or woman who worships me with perfect faith, completely absorbed in me, is the most firmly established in yoga.  \\x0c']\n",
            "['    \\x0c7: Wisdom from Realization KRISHNA  With your mind intent on me, Arjuna, discipline yourself with the practice of yoga. Depend on me completely. Listen, and I will dispel all your doubts; you will come to know me fully and be united with me. 1  I will give you both jnana and vijnana. When both these are realized, there is nothing more you need to know. 2  One person in many thousands may seek perfection, yet of these only a few reach the goal and come to realize me. 4 Earth, water, fire, air, akasha, mind, intellect, and ego  these are the eight divisions of my prakriti. 5 But beyond this I have another, higher nature, Arjuna; it supports the whole universe and is the source of life in all beings. 3  In these two aspects of my nature is the womb of all creation. The birth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. 7 There is nothing that exists separate from me, Arjuna. The entire universe is suspended from me as my necklace of jewels. 6  Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings. 9 I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant. 8  My eternal seed, Arjuna, is to be found in every creature. I am the power of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory 10  \\x0cof the noble. 11 In those who are strong, I am strength, free from passion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life. The states of sattva, rajas, and tamas come from me, but I am not in them. 13 These three gunas deceive the world: people fail to look beyond them to me, supreme and imperishable. 14 The three gunas make up my divine maya, difficult to overcome. But they cross over this maya who take refuge in me. 15 Others are deluded by maya; performing evil deeds, they have no devotion to me. Having lost all discrimination, they follow the way of their lower nature. 12  Good people come to worship me for different reasons. Some come to the spiritual life because of suffering, some in order to understand life; some come through a desire to achieve lifes purpose, and some come who are men and women of wisdom. 17 Unwavering in devotion, always united with me, the man or woman of wisdom surpasses all the others. To them I am the dearest beloved, and they are very dear to me. 18 All those who follow the spiritual path are blessed. But the wise who are always established in union, for whom there is no higher goal than me, may be regarded as my very Self. 16  After many births the wise seek refuge in me, seeing me everywhere and in everything. Such great souls are very rare. 20 There are others whose discrimination is misled by many desires. Following their own nature, they worship lower gods, practicing various rites. 19  When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that. 22 Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. 23 Those whose understanding is small attain only transient satisfaction: those who worship the gods go to the gods. But my devotees come to me. 21  Through lack of understanding, people believe that I, the Unmanifest, have entered into some form. They fail to realize my 24  \\x0ctrue nature, which transcends birth and death. 25 Few see through the veil of maya. The world, deluded, does not know that I am without birth and changeless. 26 I know everything about the past, the present, and the future, Arjuna; but there is no one who knows me completely. Delusion arises from the duality of attraction and aversion, Arjuna; every creature is deluded by these from birth. 28 But those who have freed themselves from all wrongdoing are firmly established in worship of me. Their actions are pure, and they are free from the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites. 27  Those who take refuge in me, striving for liberation from old age and death, come to know Brahman, the Self, and the nature of all action. 30 Those who see me ruling the cosmos, who see me in the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva, and the adhiyajna, are conscious of me even at the time of death. 29  \\x0c']\n",

How are the self-controlled united with you at the time of death? 1  KRISHNA  My highest nature, the imperishable Brahman, gives every creature its existence and lives in every creature as the adhyatma. My action is creation and the bringing forth of creatures. 4 The adhibhuta is the perishable body; the adhidaiva is Purusha, eternal spirit. The adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, is made to me as the Lord within you. 3  Those who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do not doubt this. 6 Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death determines the destination of the dying; always they will tend toward that state of being. 7 Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. 8 When you make your mind one-pointed through regular practice of meditation, you will find the supreme glory of the Lord. 5  The Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler, subtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable, bright as the sun, beyond darkness. 10 Remembering him in this way at the time of death, through devotion and the power of meditation, with your mind completely stilled and your concentration fixed in 9  \\x0cthe center of spiritual awareness between the eyebrows, you will realize the supreme Lord. I will tell you briefly of the eternal state all scriptures affirm, which can be entered only by those who are self-controlled and free from selfish passions. Those whose lives are dedicated to Brahman attain this supreme goal. 11  Remembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of the senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in meditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. 13 Repeating in this state the divine name, the syllable Om that represents the changeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the supreme goal. 12  I am easily attained by the person who always remembers me and is attached to nothing else. Such a person is a true yogi, Arjuna. 15 Great souls make their lives perfect and discover me; they are freed from mortality and the suffering of this separate existence. 16 Every creature in the universe is subject to rebirth, Arjuna, except the one who is united with me. 14  Those who understand the cosmic laws know that the Day of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas and the Night of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas. 18 When the day of Brahma dawns, forms are brought forth from the Unmanifest; when the night of Brahma comes, these forms merge in the Formless again. 19 This multitude of beings is created and destroyed again and again in the succeeding days and nights of Brahma. 20 But beyond this formless state there is another, unmanifested reality, which is eternal and is not dissolved when the cosmos is destroyed. 21 Those who realize lifes supreme goal know that I am unmanifested and unchanging. Having come home to me, they never return to separate existence. 17  This supreme Lord who pervades all existence, the true Self of all creatures, may be realized through undivided love. 23 There are two paths, Arjuna, which the soul may follow at the time of death. One leads to rebirth and the other to liberation. 22  \\x0cThe six months of the northern path of the sun, the path of light, of fire, of day, of the bright fortnight, leads knowers of Brahman to the supreme goal. 25 The six months of the southern path of the sun, the path of smoke, of night, of the dark fortnight, leads other souls to the light of the moon and to rebirth. 24  These two paths, the light and the dark, are said to be eternal, leading some to liberation and others to rebirth. 27 Once you have known these two paths, Arjuna, you can never be deluded again. Attain this knowledge through perseverance in yoga. 28 There is merit in studying the scriptures, in selfless service, austerity, and giving, but the practice of meditation carries you beyond all these to the supreme abode of the highest Lord. 26  \\x0c']\n",

Righteous and imperishable, it is a joy to practice and can be directly experienced. 3 But those who have no faith in the supreme law of life do not find me, Arjuna. They return to the world, passing from death to death. 2  I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifested form. All creatures find their existence in me, but I am not limited by them. 5 Behold my divine mystery! These creatures do not really dwell in me, and though I bring them forth and support them, I am not confined within them. 6 They move in me as the winds move in every direction in space. 4  At the end of the eon these creatures return to unmanifested matter; at the beginning of the next cycle I send them forth again. 8 Controlling my prakriti, again and again I bring forth these myriad forms and subject them to the laws of prakriti. 9 None of these actions binds me, Arjuna. I am unattached to them, so they do not disturb my nature. 7  Under my watchful eye the laws of nature take their course. Thus is the world set in motion; thus the animate and the inanimate are created. 10  \\x0cThe immature do not look beyond physical appearances to see my true nature as the Lord of all creation. 12 The knowledge of such deluded people is empty; their lives are fraught with disaster and evil, and their work and hopes are all in vain. 11  But truly great souls seek my divine nature. They worship me with a one-pointed mind, having realized that I am the eternal source of all. 14 Constantly striving, they make firm their resolve and worship me without wavering. Full of devotion, they sing of my divine glory. 13  Others follow the path of jnana, spiritual wisdom. They see that where there is One, that One is me; where there are many, all are me; they see my face everywhere. 15  I am the ritual and the sacrifice; I am true medicine and the mantram. I am the offering and the fire which consumes it, and the one to whom it is offered. 16  I am the father and mother of this universe, and its grandfather too; I am its entire support. I am the sum of all knowledge, the purifier, the syllable Om; I am the sacred scriptures, the Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas. 17  I am the goal of life, the Lord and support of all, the inner witness, the abode of all. I am the only refuge, the one true friend; I am the beginning, the staying, and the end of creation; I am the womb and the eternal seed. 18  I am heat; I give and withhold the rain. I am immortality and I am death; I am what is and what is not. 19  Those who follow the rituals given in the Vedas, who offer sacrifices and take soma, free themselves from evil and attain the vast heaven of the gods, where they enjoy celestial pleasures. 21 When they have enjoyed these fully, their merit is exhausted and they return to this land of death. Thus observing Vedic rituals but caught in an endless chain of desires, they come and go. 20  \\x0cThose who worship me and meditate on me constantly, without any other thought  I will provide for all their needs. 22  Those who worship other gods with faith and devotion also worship me, Arjuna, even if they do not observe the usual forms. 24 I am the object of all worship, its enjoyer and Lord. But those who fail to realize my true nature must be reborn. 25 Those who worship the devas will go to the realm of the devas; those who worship their ancestors will be united with them after death. Those who worship phantoms will become phantoms; but my devotees will come to me. 23  Whatever I am offered in devotion with a pure heart  a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water  I accept with joy. 27 Whatever you do, make it an offering to me  the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. 28 In this way you will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and painful. Then, firm in renunciation and yoga, with your heart free, you will come to me. 26  I look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and none more dear. But those who worship me with love live in me, and I come to life in them. 29  Even sinners become holy when they take refuge in me alone. 31 Quickly their souls conform to dharma and they attain to boundless peace. Never forget this, Arjuna: no one who is devoted to me will ever come to harm. 30  All those who take refuge in me, whatever their birth, race, sex, or caste, will attain the supreme goal; this realization can be attained even by those whom society scorns. 33 Kings and sages too seek this goal with devotion. Therefore, having been born in this transient and forlorn world, give all your love to me. 34 Fill your mind with me; love me; serve me; worship me always.

Desiring your welfare, O strong-armed warrior, I will tell you more. 1  Neither gods nor sages know my origin, for I am the source from which the gods and sages come. 3 Whoever knows me as the Lord of all creation, without birth or beginning, knows the truth and frees himself from all evil. 2  Discrimination, wisdom, understanding, forgiveness, truth, selfcontrol, and peace of mind; pleasure and pain, birth and death, fear and courage, honor and dishonor; 5 nonviolence, charity, equanimity, contentment, and perseverance in spiritual disciplines  all the different qualities found in living creatures have their source in me. 4  The seven great sages and the four ancient ancestors were born from my mind and received my power. From them came all the creatures of this world. 7 Whoever understands my power and the mystery of my manifestations comes without doubt to be united with me. 6  I am the source from which all creatures evolve. The wise remember this and worship me with loving devotion. 9 Their thoughts are all absorbed in me, and all their vitality flows to me. Teaching one another, talking about me always, they are happy and fulfilled. 8  \\x0cTo those steadfast in love and devotion I give spiritual wisdom, so that they may come to me. 11 Out of compassion I destroy the darkness of their ignorance. From within them I light the lamp of wisdom and dispel all darkness from their lives. 10  ARJUNA  You are Brahman supreme, the highest abode, the supreme purifier, the self-luminous, eternal spirit, first among the gods, unborn and infinite. 13 The great sages and seers  Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa too  have acclaimed you thus; now you have declared it to me yourself. 12  Now, O Krishna, I believe that everything you have told me is divine truth. O Lord, neither gods nor demons know your real nature. 15 Indeed, you alone know yourself, O supreme spirit. You are the source of being and the master of every creature, God of gods, the Lord of the universe. 14  Tell me all your divine attributes, leaving nothing unsaid. Tell me of the glories with which you fill the cosmos. 17 Krishna, you are a supreme master of yoga. Tell me how I should meditate to gain constant awareness of you. In what things and in what ways should I meditate on you? 18 O Krishna, you who stir up peoples hearts, tell me in detail your attributes and your powers; I can never tire of hearing your immortal words. 16  KRISHNA  All right, Arjuna, I will tell you of my divine powers. I will mention only the most glorious; for there is no end to them. 19  I am the true Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence. 20  Among the shining gods I am Vishnu; of luminaries I am the sun; among the storm gods I am Marichi, and in the night sky I am the moon. 21  \\x0cAmong scriptures I am the Sama Veda, and among the lesser gods I am Indra. Among the senses I am the mind, and in living beings I am consciousness. 22  Among the Rudras I am Shankara. Among the spirits of the natural world I am Kubera, god of wealth, and Pavaka, the purifying fire. Among mountains I am Meru. 23  Among priests I am Brihaspati, and among military leaders I am Skanda. Among bodies of water I am the ocean. 24  Among the great seers I am Bhrigu, and among words, the syllable Om; I am the repetition of the holy name, and among mountains I am the Himalayas. 25  Among trees I am the ashvattha, the sacred fig; among the gandharvas, the heavenly musicians, I am Chitraratha. Among divine seers I am Narada, and among sages I am Kapila. 26  I was born from the nectar of immortality as the primordial horse and as Indras noble elephant. Among human beings, I am the king. 27  Among weapons I am the thunderbolt. I am Kamadhuk, the cow that fulfills all desires; I am Kandarpa, the power of sex, and Vasuki, the king of snakes. 28  I am Ananta, the cosmic serpent, and Varuna, the god of water; I am Aryaman among the noble ancestors. Among the forces which restrain I am Yama, the god of death. 29  Among animals I am the lion; among birds, the eagle Garuda. I am Prahlada, born among the demons, and of all that measures, I am time. 30  Among purifying forces I am the wind; among warriors, Rama. Of water creatures I am the crocodile, and of rivers I am the Ganges. 31  \\x0cI am the beginning, middle, and end of creation. Of all the sciences I am the science of Self-knowledge, and I am logic in those who debate. 33 Among letters I am A; among grammatical compounds I am the dvandva. I am infinite time, and the sustainer whose face is seen everywhere. 32  I am death, which overcomes all, and the source of all beings still to be born. I am the feminine qualities: fame, beauty, perfect speech, memory, intelligence, loyalty, and forgiveness. 34  Among the hymns of the Sama Veda I am the Brihat; among poetic meters, the Gayatri. Among months I am Margashirsha, first of the year; among seasons I am spring, that brings forth flowers. 35  I am the gambling of the gambler and the radiance in all that shines. I am effort, I am victory, and I am the goodness of the virtuous. 36  Among the Vrishnis I am Krishna, and among the Pandavas I am Arjuna. Among sages I am Vyasa, and among poets, Ushanas. 37  I am the scepter which metes out punishment, and the art of statesmanship in those who lead. I am the silence of the unknown and the wisdom of the wise. 38  I am the seed that can be found in every creature, Arjuna; for without me nothing can exist, neither animate nor inanimate. 39  But there is no end to my divine attributes, Arjuna; these I have mentioned are only a few. 41 Wherever you find strength, or beauty, or spiritual power, you may be sure that these have sprung from a spark of my essence. 40  But of what use is it to you to know all this, Arjuna? Just remember that I am, and that I support the entire cosmos with only a fragment of my being. 42  \\x0c']\n",

Through your words my delusion is gone. 2 You have explained the origin and end of every creature, O lotus-eyed one, and told me of your own supreme, limitless existence. 1  Just as you have described your infinite glory, O Lord, now I long to see it. I want to see you as the supreme ruler of creation. 4 O Lord, master of yoga, if you think me strong enough to behold it, show me your immortal Self. 3  KRISHNA  Behold, Arjuna, a million divine forms, with an infinite variety of color and shape. 6 Behold the gods of the natural world, and many more wonders never revealed before. 7 Behold the entire cosmos turning within my body, and the other things you desire to see. 5  But these things cannot be seen with your physical eyes; therefore I give you spiritual vision to perceive my majestic power. 8  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, Krishna, the master of yoga, revealed to Arjuna his most exalted, lordly form. 9  He appeared with an infinite number of faces, ornamented by heavenly jewels, displaying unending miracles and the countless weapons of his power. 11 Clothed in celestial garments and covered with garlands, sweet-smelling with heavenly fragrances, he showed 10  \\x0chimself as the infinite Lord, the source of all wonders, whose face is everywhere. If a thousand suns were to rise in the heavens at the same time, the blaze of their light would resemble the splendor of that supreme spirit. 12  There, within the body of the God of gods, Arjuna saw all the manifold forms of the universe united as one. 14 Filled with amazement, his hair standing on end in ecstasy, he bowed before the Lord with joined palms and spoke these words. 13  ARJUNA  O Lord, I see within your body all the gods and every kind of living creature. I see Brahma, the Creator, seated on a lotus; I see the ancient sages and the celestial serpents. 15  I see infinite mouths and arms, stomachs and eyes, and you are embodied in every form. I see you everywhere, without beginning, middle, or end. You are the Lord of all creation, and the cosmos is your body. 16  You wear a crown and carry a mace and discus; your radiance is blinding and immeasurable. I see you, who are so difficult to behold, shining like a fiery sun blazing in every direction. 17  You are the supreme, changeless Reality, the one thing to be known. You are the refuge of all creation, the immortal spirit, the eternal guardian of eternal dharma. 18  You are without beginning, middle, or end; you touch everything with your infinite power. The sun and moon are your eyes, and your mouth is fire; your radiance warms the cosmos. 19  O Lord, your presence fills the heavens and the earth and reaches in every direction. I see the three worlds trembling before this vision of your wonderful and terrible form. 20  \\x0cThe gods enter your being, some calling out and greeting you in fear. Great saints sing your glory, praying, May all be well! 21  The multitudes of gods, demigods, and demons are all overwhelmed by the sight of you. 23 O mighty Lord, at the sight of your myriad eyes and mouths, arms and legs, stomachs and fearful teeth, I and the entire universe shake in terror. 22  O Vishnu, I can see your eyes shining; with open mouth, you glitter in an array of colors, and your body touches the sky. I look at you and my heart trembles; I have lost all courage and all peace of mind. 24  When I see your mouths with their fearful teeth, mouths burning like the fires at the end of time, I forget where I am and I have no place to go. O Lord, you are the support of the universe; have mercy on me! 25  I see all the sons of Dhritarashtra; I see Bhishma, Drona, and Karna; I see our warriors and all the kings who are here to fight. 27 All are rushing into your awful jaws; I see some of them crushed by your teeth. 28 As rivers flow into the ocean, all the warriors of this world are passing into your fiery jaws; 29 all creatures rush to their destruction like moths into a flame. 26  You lap the worlds into your burning mouths and swallow them. Filled with your terrible radiance, O Vishnu, the whole of creation bursts into flames. 30  Tell me who you are, O Lord of terrible form. I bow before you; have mercy! I want to know who you are, you who existed before all creation. Your nature and workings confound me. 31  KRISHNA  I am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world. Even without your participation, all the warriors gathered here will die. 32  \\x0cTherefore arise, Arjuna; conquer your enemies and enjoy the glory of sovereignty. I have already slain all these warriors; you will only be my instrument. 33  Bhishma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna, and many others are already slain. Kill those whom I have killed. Do not hesitate. Fight in this battle and you will conquer your enemies. 34  SANJAYA  Having heard these words, Arjuna trembled in fear. With joined palms he bowed before Krishna and addressed him stammering. 35  ARJUNA  O Krishna, it is right that the world delights and rejoices in your praise, that all the saints and sages bow down to you and all evil flees before you to the far corners of the universe. 36  How could they not worship you, O Lord? You are the eternal spirit, who existed before Brahma the Creator and who will never cease to be. Lord of the gods, you are the abode of the universe. Changeless, you are what is and what is not, and beyond the duality of existence and nonexistence. 37  You are the first among the gods, the timeless spirit, the resting place of all beings. You are the knower and the thing which is known. You are the final home; with your infinite form you pervade the cosmos. 38  You are Vayu, god of wind; Yama, god of death; Agni, god of fire; Varuna, god of water. You are the moon and the creator Prajapati, and the great-grandfather of all creatures. I bow before you and salute you again and again. 39  You are behind me and in front of me; I bow to you on every side. Your power is immeasurable. You pervade everything; you are everything. 40  \\x0cSometimes, because we were friends, I rashly said, Oh, Krishna! Say, friend!  casual, careless remarks. Whatever I may have said lightly, whether we were playing or resting, alone or in company, sitting together or eating, 42 if it was disrespectful, forgive me for it, O Krishna. I did not know the greatness of your nature, unchanging and imperishable. 41  You are the father of the universe, of the animate and the inanimate; you are the object of all worship, the greatest guru. There is none to equal you in the three worlds. Who can match your power? 44 O gracious Lord, I prostrate myself before you and ask for your blessing. As a father forgives his son, or a friend a friend, or a lover his beloved, so should you forgive me. 43  I rejoice in seeing you as you have never been seen before, yet I am filled with fear by this vision of you as the abode of the universe. Please let me see you again as the shining God of gods. 46 Though you are the embodiment of all creation, let me see you again not with a thousand arms but with four, carrying the mace and discus and wearing a crown. 45  KRISHNA  Arjuna, through my grace you have been united with me and received this vision of my radiant, universal form, without beginning or end, which no one else has ever seen. 47  Not by knowledge of the Vedas, nor sacrifice, nor charity, nor rituals, nor even by severe asceticism has any other mortal seen what you have seen, O heroic Arjuna. 48  Do not be troubled; do not fear my terrible form. Let your heart be satisfied and your fears dispelled in looking at me as I was before. 49  SANJAYA  Having spoken these words, the Lord once again assumed the gentle form of Krishna and consoled his devotee, who had been so 50  \\x0cafraid. ARJUNA  O Krishna, now that I have seen your gentle human form my mind is again composed and returned to normal. 51  KRISHNA  It is extremely difficult to obtain the vision you have had; even the gods long always to see me in this aspect. 53 Neither knowledge of the Vedas, nor austerity, nor charity, nor sacrifice can bring the vision you have seen. 54 But through unfailing devotion, Arjuna, you can know me, see me, and attain union with me. 55 Those who make me the supreme goal of all their work and act without selfish attachment, who devote themselves to me completely and are free from ill will for any creature, enter into me. 52  \\x0c']\n",

Better indeed is knowledge than mechanical practice. Better than knowledge is meditation. But better still is surrender of attachment to results, because there follows immediate peace. 12  That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure and pain, 14 patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me  with such as these I am in love. 13  Not agitating the world or by it agitated, they stand above the sway of elation, competition, and fear: that one is my beloved. 15  They are detached, pure, efficient, impartial, never anxious, selfless in all their undertakings; they are my devotees, very dear to me. 16  That one is dear to me who runs not after the pleasant or away from the painful, grieves not, lusts not, but lets things come and go as they happen. 17  That devotee who looks upon friend and foe with equal regard, who is not buoyed up by praise nor cast down by blame, alike in heat and cold, pleasure and pain, free from selfish attachments, 19 the same in honor and dishonor, quiet, ever full, in harmony everywhere, firm in faith  such a one is dear to me. 18  Those who meditate upon this immortal dharma as I have declared it, full of faith and seeking me as lifes supreme goal, are truly my devotees, and my love for them is very great. 20  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c13: The Field & the Knower KRISHNA  The body is called a field, Arjuna; the one who knows it is called the Knower of the field. This is the knowledge of those who know. 2 I am the Knower of the field in everyone, Arjuna. Knowledge of the field and its Knower is true knowledge. 1  Listen and I will explain the nature of the field and how change takes place within it. I will also describe the Knower of the field and his power. 4 These truths have been sung by great sages in a variety of ways, and expounded in precise arguments concerning Brahman. 3  The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy from which all these evolved. 6 In this field arise desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the body, intelligence, and will. 5  Those who know truly are free from pride and deceit. They are gentle, forgiving, upright, and pure, devoted to their spiritual teacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled. 8 Detached from sense objects and self-will, they have learned the painful lesson of separate birth and suffering, old age, disease, and death. 7  Free from selfish attachment, they do not get compulsively entangled even in home and family. They are even-minded through good fortune and bad. 10 Their devotion to me is undivided. Enjoying solitude and not following the crowd, they seek only me. 9  \\x0cThis is true knowledge, to seek the Self as the true end of wisdom always. To seek anything else is ignorance. 11  I will tell you of the wisdom that leads to immortality: the beginningless Brahman, which can be called neither being nor nonbeing. 12  It dwells in all, in every hand and foot and head, in every mouth and eye and ear in the universe. 14 Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. 13  It is both near and far, both within and without every creature; it moves and is unmoving. 16 In its subtlety it is beyond comprehension. It is indivisible, yet appears divided in separate creatures. Know it to be the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. 15  Dwelling in every heart, it is beyond darkness. It is called the light of light, the object and goal of knowledge, and knowledge itself. 17  I have revealed to you the nature of the field and the meaning and object of true knowledge. Those who are devoted to me, knowing these things, are united with me. 18  Know that prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning, and that from prakriti come the gunas and all that changes. 20 Prakriti is the agent, cause, and effect of every action, but it is Purusha that seems to experience pleasure and pain. 19  Purusha, resting in prakriti, witnesses the play of the gunas born of prakriti. But attachment to the gunas leads a person to be born for good or evil. 21  Within the body the supreme Purusha is called the witness, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the supreme Lord, the highest Self. 22  \\x0cWhoever realizes the true nature of Purusha, prakriti, and the gunas, whatever path he or she may follow, is not born separate again. 23  Some realize the Self within them through the practice of meditation, some by the path of wisdom, and others by selfless service. 25 Others may not know these paths; but hearing and following the instructions of an illumined teacher, they too go beyond death. 24  Whatever exists, Arjuna, animate or inanimate, is born through the union of the field and its Knower. 26  They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. 28 Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. 27  They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved. 30 When they see the variety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they attain fulfillment in Brahman. 29  This supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is touched by action. 32 As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every creature. 31  As the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the source of all light in the field. 34 Those who, with the eye of wisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to freedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal. 33  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c14: Forces of Evolution KRISHNA  Let me tell you more about the wisdom that transcends all knowledge, through which the saints and sages attained perfection. 2 Those who rely on this wisdom will be united with me. For them there is neither rebirth nor fear of death. 1  My womb is prakriti; in that I place the seed. Thus all created things are born. 4 Everything born, Arjuna, comes from the womb of prakriti, and I am the seed-giving father. 3  It is the three gunas born of prakriti  sattva, rajas, and tamas  that bind the immortal Self to the body. 6 Sattva  pure, luminous, and free from sorrow  binds us with attachment to happiness and wisdom. 7 Rajas is passion, arising from selfish desire and attachment. These bind the Self with compulsive action. 8 Tamas, born of ignorance, deludes all creatures through heedlessness, indolence, and sleep. 5  Sattva binds us to happiness; rajas binds us to action. Tamas, distorting our understanding, binds us to delusion. 9  Sattva predominates when rajas and tamas are transformed. Rajas prevails when sattva is weak and tamas overcome. Tamas prevails when rajas and sattva are dormant. 10  When sattva predominates, the light of wisdom shines through every gate of the body. 12 When rajas predominates, a person runs about pursuing selfish and greedy ends, driven by restlessness and 11  \\x0cdesire. 13 When tamas is dominant a person lives in darkness  slothful, confused, and easily infatuated. Those dying in the state of sattva attain the pure worlds of the wise. 15 Those dying in rajas are reborn among people driven by work. But those who die in tamas are conceived in the wombs of the ignorant. 14  The fruit of good deeds is pure and sattvic. The fruit of rajas is suffering. The fruit of tamas is ignorance and insensitivity. 16  From sattva comes understanding; from rajas, greed. But the outcome of tamas is confusion, infatuation, and ignorance. 17  Those who live in sattva go upwards; those in rajas remain where they are. But those immersed in tamas sink downwards. 18  The wise see clearly that all action is the work of the gunas. Knowing that which is above the gunas, they enter into union with me. 19  Going beyond the three gunas which form the body, they leave behind the cycle of birth and death, decrepitude and sorrow, and attain to immortality. 20  ARJUNA  What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the gunas, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the gunas hold? 21  KRISHNA  They are unmoved by the harmony of sattva, the activity of rajas, or the delusion of tamas. They feel no aversion when these forces are active, nor do they crave for them when these forces subside. 22  They remain impartial, undisturbed by the actions of the gunas. Knowing that it is the gunas which act, they abide within 23  \\x0cthemselves and do not vacillate. Established within themselves, they are equal in pleasure and pain, praise and blame, kindness and unkindness. Clay, a rock, and gold are the same to them. 25 Alike in honor and dishonor, alike to friend and foe, they have given up every selfish pursuit. Such are those who have gone beyond the gunas. 24  By serving me with steadfast love, a man or woman goes beyond the gunas. Such a one is fit for union with Brahman. 27 For I am the support of Brahman, the eternal, the unchanging, the deathless, the everlasting dharma, the source of all joy. 26  \\x0c']\n",

On this tree grow the scriptures; seeing their source, one knows their essence. 1  Nourished by the gunas, the limbs of this tree spread above and below. Sense objects grow on the limbs as buds; the roots hanging down bind us to action in this world. 2  The true form of this tree  its essence, beginning, and end  is not perceived on this earth. Cut down this strong-rooted tree with the sharp ax of detachment; 4 then find the path which does not come back again. Seek That, the First Cause, from which the universe came long ago. 3  Not deluded by pride, free from selfish attachment and selfish desire, beyond the duality of pleasure and pain, ever aware of the Self, the wise go forward to that eternal goal. 6 Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire can add to that light. This is my supreme abode, and those who enter there do not return to separate existence. 5  An eternal part of me enters into the world, assuming the powers of action and perception and a mind made of prakriti. 8 When the divine Self enters and leaves a body, it takes these along as the wind carries a scent from place to place. 9 Using the mind, ears, eyes, nose, and the senses of taste and touch, the Self enjoys sense objects. 7  \\x0cThe deluded do not see the Self when it leaves the body or when it dwells within it. They do not see the Self enjoying sense objects or acting through the gunas. But they who have the eye of wisdom see. 10  Those who strive resolutely on the path of yoga see the Self within. The thoughtless, who strive imperfectly, do not. 11  The brightness of the sun, which lights up the world, the brightness of the moon and of fire  these are my glory. 13 With a drop of my energy I enter the earth and support all creatures. Through the moon, the vessel of life-giving fluid, I nourish all plants. 14 I enter breathing creatures and dwell within as the lifegiving breath. I am the fire in the stomach which digests all food. 12  Entering into every heart, I give the power to remember and understand; it is I again who take that power away. All the scriptures lead to me; I am their author and their wisdom. 15  In this world there are two orders of being: the perishable, separate creature and the changeless spirit. 17 But beyond these there is another, the supreme Self, the eternal Lord, who enters into the entire cosmos and supports it from within. 16  I am that supreme Self, praised by the scriptures as beyond the changing and the changeless. 19 Those who see in me that supreme Self see truly. They have found the source of all wisdom, Arjuna, and they worship me with all their heart. 18  I have shared this profound truth with you, Arjuna.

Be self-controlled, sincere, truthful, loving, and full of the desire to serve.

Then, Arjuna, you will achieve your divine destiny. 1  Other qualities, Arjuna, make a person more and more inhuman: hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty, ignorance. 4  The divine qualities lead to freedom; the demonic, to bondage. But do not grieve, Arjuna; you were born with divine attributes. 5  Some people have divine tendencies, others demonic. I have described the divine at length, Arjuna; now listen while I describe the demonic. 6  The demonic do things they should avoid and avoid the things they should do. They have no sense of uprightness, purity, or truth. 7  There is no God, they say, no truth, no spiritual law, no moral order. The basis of life is sex; what else can it be? 9 Holding such distorted views, possessing scant discrimination, they become enemies of the world, causing suffering and destruction. 8  \\x0cHypocritical, proud, and arrogant, living in delusion and clinging to deluded ideas, insatiable in their desires, they pursue their unclean ends. 11 Although burdened with fears that end only with death, they still maintain with complete assurance, Gratification of lust is the highest that life can offer. 10  Bound on all sides by scheming and anxiety, driven by anger and greed, they amass by any means they can a hoard of money for the satisfaction of their cravings. 12  I got this today, they say; tomorrow I shall get that. This wealth is mine, and that will be mine too. 14 I have destroyed my enemies. I shall destroy others too! Am I not like God? I enjoy what I want. I am successful. I am powerful. I am happy. 15 I am rich and well-born. Who is equal to me? I will perform sacrifices and give gifts, and rejoice in my own generosity. This is how they go on, deluded by ignorance. 16 Bound by their greed and entangled in a web of delusion, whirled about by a fragmented mind, they fall into a dark hell. 13  Self-important, obstinate, swept away by the pride of wealth, they ostentatiously perform sacrifices without any regard for their purpose. 18 Egotistical, violent, arrogant, lustful, angry, envious of everyone, they abuse my presence within their own bodies and in the bodies of others. 17  Life after life I cast those who are malicious, hateful, cruel, and degraded into the wombs of those with similar demonic natures. 20 Birth after birth they find themselves with demonic tendencies. Degraded in this way, Arjuna, they fail to reach me and fall lower still. 19  There are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and greed.

Do they act from sattva, rajas, or tamas? 1  KRISHNA  Every creature is born with faith of some kind, either sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. Listen, and I will describe each to you. 2  Our faith conforms to our nature, Arjuna. Human nature is made of faith. A person is what his shraddha is. 3  Those who are sattvic worship the forms of God; those who are rajasic worship power and wealth. Those who are tamasic worship spirits and ghosts. 5 Some invent harsh penances. Motivated by hypocrisy and egotism, 6 they torture their innocent bodies and me who dwells within. Blinded by their strength and passion, they act and think like demons. 4  The three kinds of faith express themselves in the habits of those who hold them: in the food they like, the work they do, the disciplines they practice, the gifts they give. Listen, and I will describe their different ways. 7  Sattvic people enjoy food that is mild, tasty, substantial, agreeable, and nourishing, food that promotes health, strength, cheerfulness, and longevity. 9 Rajasic people like food that is salty or bitter, hot, sour, or spicy  food that promotes pain, discomfort, and disease. 10 8  \\x0cTamasic people like overcooked, stale, leftover, and impure food, food that has lost its taste and nutritional value. The sattvic perform sacrifices with their entire mind fixed on the purpose of the sacrifice. Without thought of reward, they follow the teachings of the scriptures. 12 The rajasic perform sacrifices for the sake of show and the good it will bring them. 13 The tamasic perform sacrifices ignoring both the letter and the spirit. They omit the proper prayers, the proper offerings, the proper food, and the proper faith. 11  To offer service to the gods, to the good, to the wise, and to your spiritual teacher; purity, honesty, continence, and nonviolence: these are the disciplines of the body. 15 To offer soothing words, to speak truly, kindly, and helpfully, and to study the scriptures: these are the disciplines of speech. 16 Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind. 14  When these three levels of self-discipline are practiced without attachment to the results, but in a spirit of great faith, the sages call this practice sattvic. 18 Disciplines practiced in order to gain respect, honor, or admiration are rajasic; they are undependable and transitory in their effects. 19 Disciplines practiced to gain power over others, or in the confused belief that to torture oneself is spiritual, are tamasic. 17  Giving simply because it is right to give, without thought of return, at a proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy person, is sattvic giving. 21 Giving with regrets or in the expectation of receiving some favor or of getting something in return is rajasic. 22 Giving at an inappropriate time, in inappropriate circumstances, and to an unworthy person, without affection or respect, is tamasic. 20  Om Tat Sat: these three words represent Brahman, from which come priests and scriptures and sacrifice. 24 Those who follow the Vedas, therefore, always repeat the word Om when offering sacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, or giving gifts. 25 Those seeking liberation and not any personal benefit add the word Tat 23  \\x0cwhen performing these acts of worship, discipline, and charity. 26 Sat means that which is; it also indicates goodness. Therefore it is used to describe a worthy deed. To be steadfast in self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving is sat. To act in accordance with these three is sat as well. 28 But to engage in sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving without good faith is asat, without worth or goodness, either in this life or in the next. 27  \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c18: Freedom & Renunciation ARJUNA  O Krishna, destroyer of evil, please explain to me sannyasa and tyaga and how one kind of renunciation differs from another. 1  KRISHNA  To refrain from selfish acts is one kind of renunciation, called sannyasa; to renounce the fruit of action is another, called tyaga. 2  Among the wise, some say that all action should be renounced as evil. Others say that certain kinds of action  self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline  should be continued. 4 Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain three kinds of tyaga and my conclusions concerning them. 3  Self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline should not be renounced, for they purify the thoughtful. 6 Yet even these, Arjuna, should be performed without desire for selfish rewards. This is essential. 5  To renounce ones responsibilities is not fitting. The wise call such deluded renunciation tamasic. 8 To avoid action from fear of difficulty or physical discomfort is rajasic. There is no reward in such renunciation. 9 But to fulfill your responsibilities knowing that they are obligatory, while at the same time desiring nothing for yourself  this is sattvic renunciation. 10 Those endowed with sattva clearly understand the meaning of renunciation and do not waver. They are not intimidated by unpleasant work, nor do they seek a job because it is pleasant. 7  \\x0cAs long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward. 12 Those who are attached to personal reward will reap the consequences of their actions: some pleasant, some unpleasant, some mixed. But those who renounce every desire for personal reward go beyond the reach of karma. 11  Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain the five elements necessary for the accomplishment of every action, as taught by the wisdom of Sankhya. 14 The body, the means, the ego, the performance of the act, and the divine will: 15 these are the five factors in all actions, right or wrong, in thought, word, or deed. 13  Those who do not understand this think of themselves as separate agents. With their crude intellects they fail to see the truth. 17 The person who is free from ego, who has attained purity of heart, though he slays these people, he does not slay and is not bound by his action. 16  Knowledge, the thing to be known, and the knower: these three promote action. The means, the act itself, and the doer: these three are the totality of action. 19 Knowledge, action, and the doer can be described according to the gunas. Listen, and I will explain their distinctions to you. 18  Sattvic knowledge sees the one indestructible Being in all beings, the unity underlying the multiplicity of creation. 21 Rajasic knowledge sees all things and creatures as separate and distinct. 22 Tamasic knowledge, lacking any sense of perspective, sees one small part and mistakes it for the whole. 20  Work performed to fulfill ones obligations, without thought of personal reward or of whether the job is pleasant or unpleasant, is sattvic. 24 Work prompted by selfish desire or self-will, full of stress, is rajasic. 25 Work that is undertaken blindly, without any consideration of consequences, waste, injury to others, or ones own capacities, is tamasic. 23  \\x0cSattvic workers are free from egotism and selfish attachments, full of enthusiasm and fortitude in success and failure alike. 27 Rajasic workers have strong personal desires and crave rewards for their actions. Covetous, impure, and destructive, they are easily swept away by fortune, good or bad. 28 Tamasic workers are undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, dishonest, and lazy. They are easily depressed and prone to procrastination. 26  Listen, Arjuna, as I describe the three types of understanding and will. 29  To know when to act and when to refrain from action, what is right action and what is wrong, what brings security and what insecurity, what brings freedom and what bondage: these are the signs of a sattvic intellect. 30  The rajasic intellect confuses right and wrong actions, and cannot distinguish what is to be done from what should not be done. 32 The tamasic intellect is shrouded in darkness, utterly reversing right and wrong wherever it turns. 31  The sattvic will, developed through meditation, keeps prana, mind, and senses in vital harmony. 34 The rajasic will, conditioned by selfish desire, pursues wealth, pleasure, and respectability. 35 The tamasic will shows itself in obstinate ignorance, sloth, fear, grief, depression, and conceit. 33  Now listen, Arjuna: there are also three kinds of happiness. By sustained effort, one comes to the end of sorrow. 37 That which seems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end  this is the joy of sattva, born of a mind at peace with itself. 38 Pleasure from the senses seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter as poison in the end. This is the kind of happiness that comes to the rajasic. 39 Those who are tamasic draw their pleasures from sleep, indolence, and intoxication. Both in the beginning and in the end, this happiness is a delusion. 36  \\x0cNo creature, whether born on earth or among the gods in heaven, is free from the conditioning of the three gunas. 41 The different responsibilities found in the social order  distinguishing brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra  have their roots in this conditioning. 40  The responsibilities to which brahmins are born, based on their nature, are self-control, tranquility, purity of heart, patience, humility, learning, austerity, wisdom, and faith. 42  The qualities of kshatriyas, based on their nature, are courage, strength, fortitude, dexterity, generosity, leadership, and the firm resolve never to retreat from battle. 44 The occupations suitable for a vaishya are agriculture, dairying, and trade. The proper work of a shudra is service. 43  By devotion to ones own particular duty, everyone can attain perfection. Let me tell you how. 46 By performing ones own work, one worships the Creator who dwells in every creature. Such worship brings that person to fulfillment. 45  It is better to perform ones own duties imperfectly than to master the duties of another. By fulfilling the obligations he is born with, a person never comes to grief. 48 No one should abandon duties because he sees defects in them. Every action, every activity, is surrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke. 47  One who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action. 50 Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom. 49  Unerring in discrimination, sovereign of the senses and passions, free from the clamor of likes and dislikes, 52 such a one leads a simple, self-reliant life based on meditation, controlling speech, body, and mind. 51  \\x0cFree from self-will, aggressiveness, arrogance, anger, and the lust to possess people or things, they are at peace with themselves and others and enter into the unitive state. 54 United with Brahman, ever joyful, beyond the reach of desire and sorrow, they have equal regard for every living creature and attain supreme devotion to me. 55 By loving me they come to know me truly; then they know my glory and enter into my boundless being. 56 All their acts are performed in my service, and through my grace they win eternal life. 53  Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always. 58 Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. 57  If you egotistically say, I will not fight this battle, your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. 60 Your own karma, born of your own nature, will drive you to do even that which you do not wish to do, because of your delusion. 59  The Lord dwells in the hearts of all creatures and whirls them round upon the wheel of maya. 62 Run to him for refuge with all your strength, and peace profound will be yours through his grace. 61  I give you these precious words of wisdom; reflect on them and then do as you choose. 64 These are the last words I shall speak to you, dear one, for your spiritual fulfillment. You are very dear to me. 63  Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me. 66 Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve. 65  Do not share this wisdom with anyone who lacks in devotion or self-control, lacks the desire to learn, or scoffs at me. 68 Those who teach this supreme mystery of the Gita to all who love me perform 67  \\x0cthe greatest act of love; they will come to me without doubt. 69 No one can render me more devoted service; no one on earth can be more dear to me. Those who meditate on these holy words worship me with wisdom and devotion. 71 Even those who listen to them with faith, free from doubts, will find a happier world where good people dwell. 70  Have you listened with attention? Are you now free from your doubts and confusion? 72  ARJUNA  You have dispelled my doubts and delusions, and I understand through your grace. My faith is firm now, and I will do your will. 73  SANJAYA  This is the dialogue I heard between Krishna, the son of Vasudeva, and Arjuna, the great-hearted son of Pritha. The wonder of it makes my hair stand on end! 75 Through Vyasas grace, I have heard the supreme secret of spiritual union directly from the Lord of Yoga, Krishna himself. 74  Whenever I remember these wonderful, holy words between Krishna and Arjuna, I am filled with joy. 77 And when I remember the breathtaking form of Krishna, I am filled with wonder and my joy overflows. 76  Wherever the divine Krishna and the mighty Arjuna are, there will be prosperity, victory, happiness, and sound judgment. Of this I am sure! 78  \\x0c']\n"

            "['   \\x0c : The War Within DHRITARASHTRA  O Sanjaya, tell happened Kurukshetra, field dharma, family Pandavas gathered fight.    SANJAYA  Having surveyed forces Pandavas arrayed battle, prince Duryodhana approached teacher, Drona, spoke.   O teacher, look mighty army Pandavas, assembled gifted disciple, Yudhishthira.   There heroic warriors great archers equals Bhima Arjuna: Yuyudhana, Virata, mighty Drupada,   Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, valiant king Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja,the great leader Shaibya,   powerful Yudhamanyu, valiant Uttamaujas, son Subhadra, addition sons Draupadi. All command mighty chariots.    O best brahmins, listen names distinguished among forces:   Bhishma, Karna, victorious Kripa; Ashvatthama, Vikarna, son Somadatta.    There many others, too, heroes giving lives sake, proficient war armed variety weapons.    Our army unlimited commanded Bhishma; small commanded Bhima.    Let everyone take proper place stand firm supporting Bhishma!    Then powerful Bhishma, grandsire, oldest Kurus, order cheer Duryodhana, roared like lion blew     \\x0cconch horn.    And Bhishma, tremendous noise arose conchs cow horns pounding drums. Then Sri Krishna Arjuna, standing mighty chariot yoked white horses, blew divine conchs.    Sri Krishna blew conch named Panchajanya, Arjuna blew called Devadatta. The mighty Bhima blew huge conch Paundra.    Yudhishthira, king, son Kunti, blew conch Anantavijaya; Nakula Sahadeva blew conchs well.    Then king Kashi, leading bowman, great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, invincible Satyaki,    Drupada, sons Draupadi, strong-armed son Subhadra joined in,    noise tore heart Duryodhanas army. Indeed, sound tumultuous, echoing throughout heaven earth.     Then, O Dhritarashtra, lord earth, seen sons forces set places fighting begin, Arjuna spoke words Sri Krishna:     ARJUNA  O Krishna, drive chariot two armies.    I want see desire fight me. With battle fought?    I want see assembled fight Duryodhana, seek please evil-minded son Dhritarashtra engaging war.     SANJAYA  Thus Arjuna spoke, Sri Krishna, driving splendid chariot two armies,    facing Bhishma Drona kings earth, said: Arjuna, behold Kurus gathered together.     And Arjuna, standing two armies, saw fathers grandfathers, teachers, uncles, brothers, sons grandsons,    in-laws friends. Seeing kinsmen established opposition,    Arjuna overcome sorrow. Despairing, spoke words:     \\x0cARJUNA  O Krishna, I see relations anxious fight,    limbs grow weak; mouth dry, body shakes, hair standing end.    My skin burns, bow Gandiva slipped hand. I unable stand; mind seems whirling.    These signs bode evil us. I not see good come killing relations battle.    O Krishna, I no desire victory, kingdom pleasures. Of use kingdom pleasure even life,    whose sake desire things     teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, in-laws, grandsons, others family ties  engaging battle, renouncing wealth lives?    Even kill me, I would not want kill them, not even become ruler three worlds. How much less earth alone? O Krishna, satisfaction could find killing Dhritarashtras sons? We would become sinners slaying men, even though evil.    The sons Dhritarashtra related us; therefore, not kill them. How gain happiness killing members family?     Though overpowered greed see no evil destroying families injuring friends, see evils.    Why shouldnt turn away sin?    When family declines, ancient traditions destroyed. With lost spiritual foundations life, family loses sense unity.    Where no sense unity, women family become corrupt; corruption women, society plunged chaos.    Social chaos hell family destroyed family well. It disrupts process spiritual evolution begun ancestors.    The timeless spiritual foundations family society would destroyed terrible deeds, violate unity life.     It said whose family dharma destroyed dwell hell.    This great sin! We prepared kill relations greed pleasures kingdom.    Better     \\x0cme sons Dhritarashtra, weapons hand, attack battle kill unarmed unresisting. SANJAYA  Overwhelmed sorrow, Arjuna spoke words. And casting away bow arrows, sat chariot middle battlefield.     \\x0c']\n",
            "['   \\x0c : Self-Realization SANJAYA  These words Sri Krishna spoke despairing Arjuna, whose eyes burning tears pity confusion.    KRISHNA  This despair weakness time crisis mean unworthy you, Arjuna. How fallen state far path liberation?   It not become yield weakness. Arise brave heart destroy enemy.    ARJUNA  How I ever bring fight Bhishma Drona, worthy reverence? How I, Krishna?   Surely would better spend life begging kill great worthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would tainted.   I dont even know would better, us conquer conquer us. The sons Dhritarashtra confronted us; would care live killed them?    My paralyzed, I utterly confused. Tell better path me. Let disciple. I fallen feet; give instruction.   What overcome sorrow saps vitality? Even power men gods wealth empire seem empty.    SANJAYA  \\x0cThis Arjuna, great warrior, spoke Sri Krishna. With words, O Krishna, I not fight, fell silent.    As stood two armies, Sri Krishna smiled replied Arjuna, sunk despair.    KRISHNA  You speak sincerely, sorrow no cause. The wise grieve neither living dead.    There never time I kings gathered not existed, time cease exist.    As person inhabits body childhood, youth, old age, time death attains another body. The wise not deluded changes.     When senses contact sense objects, person experiences cold heat, pleasure pain. These experiences fleeting; come go. Bear patiently, Arjuna.    Those unaffected changes, pleasure pain, truly wise fit immortality. Assert strength realize this!     The impermanent no reality; reality lies eternal. Those seen boundary two attained end knowledge.    Realize pervades universe indestructible; no power affect unchanging, imperishable reality.    The body mortal, dwells body immortal immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, fight battle.     One believes slayer, another believes slain. Both ignorant; neither slayer slain.    You never born; never die. You never changed; never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, not die body dies.    Realizing indestructible, eternal, unborn, unchanging, slay cause another slay?     \\x0cAs one abandons worn-out clothes acquires new ones, body worn new one acquired Self, lives within.     The Self cannot pierced weapons burned fire; water cannot wet it, wind dry it.    The Self cannot pierced burned, made wet dry. It everlasting infinite, standing motionless foundations eternity.    The Self unmanifested, beyond thought, beyond change. Knowing this, not grieve.     O mighty Arjuna, even believe Self subject birth death, not grieve.    Death inevitable living; birth inevitable dead. Since unavoidable, not sorrow.    Every creature unmanifested first attains manifestation. When end come, becomes unmanifested. What lament this?     The glory Self beheld few, describe it; listen, many without understanding.    The Self beings, living within body, eternal cannot harmed. Therefore, not grieve.     Considering dharma, not vacillate. For warrior, nothing higher war evil.    The warrior confronted war pleased, Arjuna, comes open gate heaven.    But not participate battle evil, incur sin, violating dharma honor.     The story dishonor repeated endlessly: man honor, dishonor worse death.    These brave warriors think withdrawn battle fear, formerly esteemed treat disrespect.    Your enemies ridicule strength say things not said. What could painful this?     Death means attainment heaven; victory means enjoyment earth. Therefore rise up, Arjuna, resolved fight!     \\x0cHaving made alike pain pleasure, profit loss, victory defeat, engage great battle freed sin.     You heard intellectual explanation Sankhya, Arjuna; listen principles yoga. By practicing break bonds karma.    On path effort never goes waste, no failure. Even little effort toward spiritual awareness protect greatest fear.     Those follow path, resolving deep within seek alone, attain singleness purpose.

Then, O Dhritarashtra, lord earth, seen sons forces set places fighting begin, Arjuna spoke words Sri Krishna:     ARJUNA  O Krishna, drive chariot two armies.    I want see desire fight me. With battle fought?    I want see assembled fight Duryodhana, seek please evil-minded son Dhritarashtra engaging war.     SANJAYA  Thus Arjuna spoke, Sri Krishna, driving splendid chariot two armies,    facing Bhishma Drona kings earth, said: Arjuna, behold Kurus gathered together.     And Arjuna, standing two armies, saw fathers grandfathers, teachers, uncles, brothers, sons grandsons,    in-laws friends. Seeing kinsmen established opposition,    Arjuna overcome sorrow. Despairing, spoke words:     \fARJUNA  O Krishna, I see relations anxious fight,    limbs grow weak; mouth dry, body shakes, hair standing end.    My skin burns, bow Gandiva slipped hand. I unable stand; mind seems whirling.    These signs bode evil us. I not see good come killing relations battle.    O Krishna, I no desire victory, kingdom pleasures. Of use kingdom pleasure even life,    whose sake desire things     teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, in-laws, grandsons, others family ties  engaging battle, renouncing wealth lives?    Even kill me, I would not want kill them, not even become ruler three worlds. How much less earth alone? O Krishna, satisfaction could find killing Dhritarashtras sons? We would become sinners slaying men, even though evil.    The sons Dhritarashtra related us; therefore, not kill them. How gain happiness killing members family?     Though overpowered greed see no evil destroying families injuring friends, see evils.    Why shouldnt turn away sin?    When family declines, ancient traditions destroyed. With lost spiritual foundations life, family loses sense unity.    Where no sense unity, women family become corrupt; corruption women, society plunged chaos.    Social chaos hell family destroyed family well. It disrupts process spiritual evolution begun ancestors.    The timeless spiritual foundations family society would destroyed terrible deeds, violate unity life.     It said whose family dharma destroyed dwell hell.    This great sin! We prepared kill relations greed pleasures kingdom.    Better     \fme sons Dhritarashtra, weapons hand, attack battle kill unarmed unresisting. SANJAYA  Overwhelmed sorrow, Arjuna spoke words. And casting away bow arrows, sat chariot middle battlefield.     \f    \f : Self-Realization SANJAYA  These words Sri Krishna spoke despairing Arjuna, whose eyes burning tears pity confusion.    KRISHNA  This despair weakness time crisis mean unworthy you, Arjuna. How fallen state far path liberation?   It not become yield weakness. Arise brave heart destroy enemy.    ARJUNA  How I ever bring fight Bhishma Drona, worthy reverence? How I, Krishna?   Surely would better spend life begging kill great worthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would tainted.   I dont even know would better, us conquer conquer us. The sons Dhritarashtra confronted us; would care live killed them?    My paralyzed, I utterly confused. Tell better path me. Let disciple. I fallen feet; give instruction.   What overcome sorrow saps vitality? Even power men gods wealth empire seem empty.    SANJAYA  \fThis Arjuna, great warrior, spoke Sri Krishna. With words, O Krishna, I not fight, fell silent.    As stood two armies, Sri Krishna smiled replied Arjuna, sunk despair.    KRISHNA  You speak sincerely, sorrow no cause. The wise grieve neither living dead.    There never time I kings gathered not existed, time cease exist.    As person inhabits body childhood, youth, old age, time death attains another body. The wise not deluded changes.     When senses contact sense objects, person experiences cold heat, pleasure pain. These experiences fleeting; come go. Bear patiently, Arjuna.    Those unaffected changes, pleasure pain, truly wise fit immortality. Assert strength realize this!     The impermanent no reality; reality lies eternal. Those seen boundary two attained end knowledge.    Realize pervades universe indestructible; no power affect unchanging, imperishable reality.    The body mortal, dwells body immortal immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, fight battle.     One believes slayer, another believes slain. Both ignorant; neither slayer slain.    You never born; never die. You never changed; never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, not die body dies.    Realizing indestructible, eternal, unborn, unchanging, slay cause another slay?     \fAs one abandons worn-out clothes acquires new ones, body worn new one acquired Self, lives within.     The Self cannot pierced weapons burned fire; water cannot wet it, wind dry it.    The Self cannot pierced burned, made wet dry. It everlasting infinite, standing motionless foundations eternity.    The Self unmanifested, beyond thought, beyond change. Knowing this, not grieve.     O mighty Arjuna, even believe Self subject birth death, not grieve.    Death inevitable living; birth inevitable dead. Since unavoidable, not sorrow.    Every creature unmanifested first attains manifestation. When end come, becomes unmanifested. What lament this?     The glory Self beheld few, describe it; listen, many without understanding.    The Self beings, living within body, eternal cannot harmed. Therefore, not grieve.     Considering dharma, not vacillate. For warrior, nothing higher war evil.    The warrior confronted war pleased, Arjuna, comes open gate heaven.    But not participate battle evil, incur sin, violating dharma honor.     The story dishonor repeated endlessly: man honor, dishonor worse death.    These brave warriors think withdrawn battle fear, formerly esteemed treat disrespect.    Your enemies ridicule strength say things not said. What could painful this?     Death means attainment heaven; victory means enjoyment earth. Therefore rise up, Arjuna, resolved fight!     \fHaving made alike pain pleasure, profit loss, victory defeat, engage great battle freed sin.     You heard intellectual explanation Sankhya, Arjuna; listen principles yoga. By practicing break bonds karma.    On path effort never goes waste, no failure. Even little effort toward spiritual awareness protect greatest fear.     Those follow path, resolving deep within seek alone, attain singleness purpose. For lack resolution, decisions life many-branched endless.     There ignorant people speak flowery words take delight letter law, saying nothing else.    Their hearts full selfish desires, Arjuna. Their idea heaven enjoyment, aim activities pleasure power. The fruit actions continual rebirth.    Those whose minds swept away pursuit pleasure power incapable following supreme goal not attain samadhi.     The scriptures describe three gunas. But free action gunas, established eternal truth, selfcontrolled, without sense duality desire acquire hoard.     Just reservoir little use whole countryside flooded, scriptures little use illumined man woman, sees Lord everywhere.     You right work, never fruit work. You never engage action sake reward, long inaction.    Perform work world, Arjuna, man established within  without selfish attachments, alike success defeat. For yoga perfect evenness mind.     \fSeek refuge attitude detachment amass wealth spiritual awareness. Those motivated desire fruits action miserable, constantly anxious results do.    When consciousness unified, however, vain anxiety left behind. There no cause worry, whether things go well ill. Therefore, devote disciplines yoga, yoga skill action.     The wise unify consciousness abandon attachment fruits action, binds person continual rebirth. Thus attain state beyond evil.     When mind overcome confusion duality, attain state holy indifference things hear things heard.    When unmoved confusion ideas mind completely united deep samadhi, attain state perfect yoga.     ARJUNA  Tell live established wisdom, ever aware Self, O Krishna. How talk? How sit? How move about?     KRISHNA  They live wisdom see them, renounced every selfish desire sense craving tormenting heart.     Neither agitated grief hankering pleasure, live free lust fear anger. Established meditation, truly wise.    Fettered no selfish attachments, neither elated good fortune depressed bad. Such seers.     Even tortoise draws limbs, wise draw senses will.    Aspirants abstain sense pleasures, still crave them. These cravings disappear see highest goal.    Even tread path, stormy senses     \fcan sweep mind.    They live wisdom subdue senses keep minds ever absorbed me. When keep thinking sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, lust possession burns anger.    Anger clouds judgment; no longer learn past mistakes. Lost power choose wise unwise, life utter waste.    But move amidst world sense, free attachment aversion alike,    comes peace sorrows end, live wisdom Self.     The disunited mind far wise; meditate? How peace? When know no peace, know joy?    When let mind follow call senses, carry away better judgment storms drive boat charted course sea.     Use power free senses attachment aversion alike, live full wisdom Self.    Such sage awakes light night creatures. That world calls day night ignorance wise.     As rivers flow ocean cannot make vast ocean overflow, flow streams sense-world sea peace sage. But not desirer desires.     They forever free renounce selfish desires break away ego-cage I, me, mine united Lord.    This supreme state. Attain this, pass death immortality.     \f    \f : Selfless Service ARJUNA  O Krishna, said knowledge greater action; ask wage terrible war?   Your advice seems inconsistent. Give one path follow supreme good.    KRISHNA  At beginning time I declared two paths pure heart: jnana yoga, contemplative path spiritual wisdom, karma yoga, active path selfless service.    One shirks action not attain freedom; no one gain perfection abstaining work.   Indeed, no one rests even instant; creatures driven action nature.    Those abstain action allowing mind dwell sensual pleasure cannot called sincere spiritual aspirants.   But excel control senses mind, using selfless service.    Fulfill duties; action better inaction. Even maintain body, Arjuna, obliged act.   Selfish action imprisons world. Act selflessly, without thought personal profit.    At beginning, mankind obligation selfless service created together. Through selfless service, always     \ffruitful find fulfillment desires: promise Creator. Honor cherish devas honor cherish you; honor love attain supreme good.    All human desires fulfilled devas, pleased selfless service. But anyone enjoys things given devas without offering selfless acts return thief.     The spiritually minded, eat spirit service, freed sins; selfish, prepare food satisfaction, eat sin.    Living creatures nourished food, food nourished rain; rain water life, comes selfless worship service.     Every selfless act, Arjuna, born Brahman, eternal, infinite Godhead. Brahman present every act service.    All life turns law, O Arjuna. Those violate it, indulging senses pleasure ignoring needs others, wasted life.    But realize Self always satisfied. Having found source joy fulfillment, no longer seek happiness external world.    They nothing gain lose action; neither people things affect security.     Strive constantly serve welfare world; devotion selfless work one attains supreme goal life.    Do work welfare others always mind. It work Janaka attained perfection; others followed path.     What outstanding person does, others try do. The standards people create followed whole world.    There nothing three worlds gain, Arjuna, anything I not have; I continue act, I not driven need own.    If I ever refrained continuous work, everyone would immediately follow example.    If I stopped working I would cause cosmic chaos, finally destruction world people.     \fThe ignorant work profit, Arjuna; wise work welfare world, without thought themselves.    By abstaining work confuse ignorant, engrossed actions. Perform work carefully, guided compassion.     All actions performed gunas prakriti. Deluded identification ego, person thinks, I doer.    But illumined man woman understands domain gunas not attached. Such people know gunas interact other; not claim doer.     Those deluded operation gunas become attached results action. Those understand truths not unsettle ignorant.    Performing actions sake, completely absorbed Self, without expectations, fight!  stay free fever ego.     Those live accordance divine laws without complaining, firmly established faith, released karma.    Those violate laws, criticizing complaining, utterly deluded, cause suffering.     Even wise act within limitations nature. Every creature subject prakriti; use repression?    The senses conditioned attraction pleasant aversion unpleasant. Do not ruled them; obstacles path.     It better strive ones dharma succeed dharma another. Nothing ever lost following ones dharma, competition anothers dharma breeds fear insecurity.     ARJUNA  What force binds us selfish deeds, O Krishna? What power moves us, even will, forcing us?     \fKRISHNA  It selfish desire anger, arising guna rajas; appetites evils threaten person life.     Just fire covered smoke mirror obscured dust, embryo rests deep within womb, knowledge hidden selfish desire     hidden, Arjuna, unquenchable fire self-satisfaction, inveterate enemy wise.     Selfish desire found senses, mind, intellect, misleading burying understanding delusion.    Fight strength, Arjuna! Controlling senses, conquer enemy, destroyer knowledge realization.     The senses higher body, mind higher senses; mind intellect, intellect Atman.    Thus, knowing supreme, let Atman rule ego. Use mighty arms slay fierce enemy selfish desire.     \f    \f : Wisdom Action KRISHNA  I told eternal secret Vivasvat. Vivasvat taught Manu, Manu taught Ikshvaku.   Thus, Arjuna, eminent sages received knowledge yoga continuous tradition. But time practice yoga lost world.    The secret teachings profound. I explained today friend devotee.    ARJUNA  You born much Vivasvat; lived long ago. Why say taught yoga beginning?    KRISHNA  You I passed many births, Arjuna. You forgotten, I remember all.    My true unborn changeless. I Lord dwells every creature. Through power maya, I manifest finite form.    Whenever dharma declines purpose life forgotten, I manifest earth.   I born every age protect good, destroy evil, reestablish dharma.    Those know divine Self break belief body not reborn separate creatures. Such one, Arjuna, united me.    Delivered selfish    \fattachment, fear, anger, filled me, surrendering me, purified fire being, many reached state unity me. As approach me, I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead me.     Those desiring success actions worship gods; action world mortals, desires quickly fulfilled.    The distinctions caste, guna, karma come me. I cause, I changeless beyond action.    Actions not cling I not attached results. Those understand practice live freedom.    Knowing truth, aspirants desiring liberation ancient times engaged action. You same, pursuing active life manner ancient sages.     What action inaction? This question confused greatest sages. I give secret action, free bondage.    The true nature action difficult grasp. You must understand action inaction, kind action avoided.     The wise see action midst inaction inaction midst action. Their consciousness unified, every act done complete awareness.     The awakened sages call person wise undertakings free anxiety results; selfish desires consumed fire knowledge.    The wise, ever satisfied, abandoned external supports. Their security unaffected results action; even acting, really nothing all.    Free expectations sense possession, mind body firmly controlled Self, not incur sin performance physical action.     They live freedom gone beyond dualities life. Competing no one, alike success failure     \fcontent whatever comes them.    They free, without selfish attachments; minds fixed knowledge. They perform work spirit service, karma dissolved. The process offering Brahman; offered Brahman. Brahman offers sacrifice fire Brahman. Brahman attained see Brahman every action.     Some aspirants offer material sacrifices gods. Others offer selfless service sacrifice fire Brahman.    Some renounce enjoyment senses, sacrificing fire sense restraint. Others partake sense objects offer service fire senses.    Some offer workings senses vital forces fire self-control, kindled path knowledge.     Some offer wealth; others offer sense restraint suffering. Some take vows offer knowledge study scriptures; make offering meditation.    Some offer forces vitality, regulating inhalation exhalation, thus gain control forces.    Others offer forces vitality restraint senses. All understand meaning service cleansed impurities.     True sustenance service, man woman reaches eternal Brahman. But not seek serve without home world. Arjuna, home world come?     These offerings born work, guides mankind along path Brahman. Understanding this, attain liberation.    The offering wisdom better material offering, Arjuna; goal work spiritual wisdom.     Approach realized purpose life question reverence devotion; instruct     \fthis wisdom.    Once attain it, never deluded. You see creatures Self, me. Even sinful sinners, Arjuna, could cross beyond sin raft spiritual wisdom.    As heat fire reduces wood ashes, fire knowledge burns ashes karma.    Nothing world purifies like spiritual wisdom. It perfection achieved time path yoga, path leads Self within.     Those take wisdom highest goal, whose faith deep whose senses trained, attain wisdom quickly enter perfect peace.    But ignorant, indecisive lacking faith, waste lives. They never happy world other.     Those established Self renounced selfish attachments actions cut doubts spiritual wisdom. They act freedom.    Arjuna, cut doubt heart sword spiritual wisdom. Arise; take path yoga!     \f    \f : Renounce & Rejoice ARJUNA  O Krishna, recommended path selfless action sannyasa, path renunciation action. Tell definitely better.    KRISHNA  Both renunciation action selfless performance action lead supreme goal. But path action better renunciation.    Those attained perfect renunciation free sense duality; unaffected likes dislikes, Arjuna, free bondage self-will.   The immature think knowledge action different, wise see same. The person established one path attain rewards both.   The goal knowledge goal service same; fail see blind.    Perfect renunciation difficult attain without performing action. But wise, following path selfless service, quickly reach Brahman.    Those follow path service, completely purified conquered senses self-will, see Self creatures untouched action perform.    Those know truth, whose consciousness unified, think always, I not doer. While seeing hearing, touching    \fsmelling; eating, moving about, sleeping; breathing   speaking, letting go holding on, even opening closing eyes, understand movements senses among sense objects. Those surrender Brahman selfish attachments like leaf lotus floating clean dry water. Sin cannot touch them.    Renouncing selfish attachments, follow path service work body, senses, mind sake self-purification.     Those whose consciousness unified abandon attachment results action attain supreme peace. But whose desires fragmented, selfishly attached results work, bound everything do.     Those renounce attachment deeds live content city nine gates, body, master. They not driven act, involve others action.     Neither sense acting, actions, connection cause effect comes Lord world. These three arise nature.     The Lord not partake good evil deeds person; judgment clouded wisdom obscured ignorance.    But ignorance destroyed knowledge Self within. The light knowledge shines like sun, revealing supreme Brahman.    Those cast sin knowledge, absorbed Lord established one goal refuge, not reborn separate creatures.     Those possess wisdom equal regard all. They see Self spiritual aspirant outcaste, elephant, cow, dog.    Such people mastered life. With even mind rest Brahman, perfect everywhere same.

Theirs true renunciation.   Therefore, Arjuna, understand renunciation performance selfless service same. Those cannot renounce attachment results work far path.    For aspirants want climb mountain spiritual awareness, path selfless work; ascended yoga path stillness peace.   When person freed attachment results work, desires enjoyment sense objects, ascends unitive state.    Reshape power will; never let degraded self-will. The friend Self, enemy Self.    To conquered themselves, friend. But enemy not found Self within them.    The supreme Reality stands revealed consciousness conquered themselves. They live peace, alike cold heat, pleasure pain, praise blame.    They completely fulfilled spiritual wisdom Selfrealization. Having conquered senses, climbed summit human consciousness. To people clod dirt, stone, gold same.   They equally disposed family,    \fenemies, friends, support hostile, good evil alike. Because impartial, rise great heights. Those aspire state yoga seek Self inner solitude meditation. With body mind controlled constantly practice one-pointedness, free expectations attachment material possessions.     Select clean spot, neither high low, seat firmly cloth, deerskin, kusha grass.    Then, seated, strive still thoughts. Make mind one-pointed meditation, heart purified.

With senses mind constantly controlled meditation, united Self within, aspirant attains nirvana, state abiding joy peace me.

Seeing life manifestation, never separated me.    They worship hearts all, actions proceed me. Wherever may live, abide me.     When person responds joys sorrows others own, attained highest state spiritual union.     ARJUNA  O Krishna, stillness divine union describe beyond comprehension. How mind, restless, attain lasting peace?    Krishna, mind restless, turbulent, powerful, violent; trying control like trying tame wind.     KRISHNA  \fIt true mind restless difficult control. But conquered, Arjuna, regular practice detachment.    Those lack self-control find difficult progress meditation; self-controlled, striving earnestly right means, attain goal.     ARJUNA  Krishna, happens man faith lacks self-control wanders path, not attaining success yoga?    If man becomes deluded spiritual path, lose support worlds, like cloud scattered sky?    Krishna, dispel doubts; remove doubt binds me.     KRISHNA  Arjuna, son, person not destroyed. No one good work ever come bad end, either world come.     When people die, go realms righteous live. They dwell countless years reborn home pure prosperous.    Or may born family meditation practiced; born family extremely rare.    The wisdom acquired previous lives reawakened, Arjuna, strive even harder Self-realization.    Indeed, driven strength past disciplines. Even one inquires practice meditation rises simply perform rituals.     Through constant effort many lifetimes, person becomes purified selfish desires attains supreme goal life.     Meditation superior severe asceticism path knowledge. It also superior selfless service. May attain goal meditation, Arjuna!    Even among meditate,     \fman woman worships perfect faith, completely absorbed me, firmly established yoga.  \f     \f : Wisdom Realization KRISHNA  With mind intent me, Arjuna, discipline practice yoga. Depend completely. Listen, I dispel doubts; come know fully united me.    I give jnana vijnana. When realized, nothing need know.    One person many thousands may seek perfection, yet reach goal come realize me.   Earth, water, fire, air, akasha, mind, intellect, ego  eight divisions prakriti.   But beyond I another, higher nature, Arjuna; supports whole universe source life beings.    In two aspects nature womb creation. The birth dissolution cosmos take place me.   There nothing exists separate me, Arjuna. The entire universe suspended necklace jewels.    Arjuna, I taste pure water radiance sun moon. I sacred word sound heard air, courage human beings.   I sweet fragrance earth radiance fire; I life every creature striving spiritual aspirant.    My eternal seed, Arjuna, found every creature. I power discrimination intelligent, glory     \fof noble.    In strong, I strength, free passion selfish attachment. I desire itself, desire harmony purpose life. The states sattva, rajas, tamas come me, I not them.    These three gunas deceive world: people fail look beyond me, supreme imperishable.    The three gunas make divine maya, difficult overcome. But cross maya take refuge me.    Others deluded maya; performing evil deeds, no devotion me. Having lost discrimination, follow way lower nature.     Good people come worship different reasons. Some come spiritual life suffering, order understand life; come desire achieve lifes purpose, come men women wisdom.    Unwavering devotion, always united me, man woman wisdom surpasses others. To I dearest beloved, dear me.    All follow spiritual path blessed. But wise always established union, no higher goal me, may regarded Self.     After many births wise seek refuge me, seeing everywhere everything. Such great souls rare.    There others whose discrimination misled many desires. Following nature, worship lower gods, practicing various rites.     When person devoted something complete faith, I unify faith that.    Then, faith completely unified, one gains object devotion. In way, every desire fulfilled me.    Those whose understanding small attain transient satisfaction: worship gods go gods. But devotees come me.     Through lack understanding, people believe I, Unmanifest, entered form. They fail realize     \ftrue nature, transcends birth death.    Few see veil maya. The world, deluded, not know I without birth changeless.    I know everything past, present, future, Arjuna; no one knows completely. Delusion arises duality attraction aversion, Arjuna; every creature deluded birth.    But freed wrongdoing firmly established worship me. Their actions pure, free delusion caused pairs opposites.     Those take refuge me, striving liberation old age death, come know Brahman, Self, nature action.    Those see ruling cosmos, see adhibhuta, adhidaiva, adhiyajna, conscious even time death.     \f    \f : Eternal Godhead ARJUNA  O Krishna, Brahman, nature action? What adhyatma, adhibhuta, adhidaiva?   What adhiyajna, supreme sacrifice, offered? How self-controlled united time death?    KRISHNA  My highest nature, imperishable Brahman, gives every creature existence lives every creature adhyatma. My action creation bringing forth creatures.   The adhibhuta perishable body; adhidaiva Purusha, eternal spirit. The adhiyajna, supreme sacrifice, made Lord within you.    Those remember time death come me. Do not doubt this.   Whatever occupies mind time death determines destination dying; always tend toward state being.   Therefore, remember times fight on. With heart mind intent me, surely come me.   When make mind one-pointed regular practice meditation, find supreme glory Lord.    The Lord supreme poet, first cause, sovereign ruler, subtler tiniest particle, support all, inconceivable, bright sun, beyond darkness.    Remembering way time death, devotion power meditation, mind completely stilled concentration fixed    \fthe center spiritual awareness eyebrows, realize supreme Lord. I tell briefly eternal state scriptures affirm, entered self-controlled free selfish passions. Those whose lives dedicated Brahman attain supreme goal.     Remembering time death, close doors senses place mind heart. Then, absorbed meditation, focus energy upwards head.    Repeating state divine name, syllable Om represents changeless Brahman, go forth body attain supreme goal.     I easily attained person always remembers attached nothing else. Such person true yogi, Arjuna.    Great souls make lives perfect discover me; freed mortality suffering separate existence.    Every creature universe subject rebirth, Arjuna, except one united me.     Those understand cosmic laws know Day Brahma ends thousand yugas Night Brahma ends thousand yugas.    When day Brahma dawns, forms brought forth Unmanifest; night Brahma comes, forms merge Formless again.    This multitude beings created destroyed succeeding days nights Brahma.    But beyond formless state another, unmanifested reality, eternal not dissolved cosmos destroyed.    Those realize lifes supreme goal know I unmanifested unchanging. Having come home me, never return separate existence.     This supreme Lord pervades existence, true Self creatures, may realized undivided love.    There two paths, Arjuna, soul may follow time death. One leads rebirth liberation.     \fThe six months northern path sun, path light, fire, day, bright fortnight, leads knowers Brahman supreme goal.    The six months southern path sun, path smoke, night, dark fortnight, leads souls light moon rebirth.     These two paths, light dark, said eternal, leading liberation others rebirth.    Once known two paths, Arjuna, never deluded again. Attain knowledge perseverance yoga.    There merit studying scriptures, selfless service, austerity, giving, practice meditation carries beyond supreme abode highest Lord.     \f    \f : The Royal Path KRISHNA  Because faith, I shall tell profound secrets: obtaining jnana vijnana, free evil.    This royal knowledge, royal secret, greatest purifier. Righteous imperishable, joy practice directly experienced.   But no faith supreme law life not find me, Arjuna. They return world, passing death death.    I pervade entire universe unmanifested form. All creatures find existence me, I not limited them.   Behold divine mystery! These creatures not really dwell me, though I bring forth support them, I not confined within them.   They move winds move every direction space.    At end eon creatures return unmanifested matter; beginning next cycle I send forth again.   Controlling prakriti, I bring forth myriad forms subject laws prakriti.   None actions binds me, Arjuna. I unattached them, not disturb nature.    Under watchful eye laws nature take course. Thus world set motion; thus animate inanimate created.     \fThe immature not look beyond physical appearances see true nature Lord creation.    The knowledge deluded people empty; lives fraught disaster evil, work hopes vain.     But truly great souls seek divine nature. They worship one-pointed mind, realized I eternal source all.    Constantly striving, make firm resolve worship without wavering. Full devotion, sing divine glory.     Others follow path jnana, spiritual wisdom. They see One, One me; many, me; see face everywhere.     I ritual sacrifice; I true medicine mantram. I offering fire consumes it, one offered.     I father mother universe, grandfather too; I entire support. I sum knowledge, purifier, syllable Om; I sacred scriptures, Rig, Yajur, Sama Vedas.     I goal life, Lord support all, inner witness, abode all. I refuge, one true friend; I beginning, staying, end creation; I womb eternal seed.     I heat; I give withhold rain. I immortality I death; I not.     Those follow rituals given Vedas, offer sacrifices take soma, free evil attain vast heaven gods, enjoy celestial pleasures.    When enjoyed fully, merit exhausted return land death. Thus observing Vedic rituals caught endless chain desires, come go.     \fThose worship meditate constantly, without thought  I provide needs.     Those worship gods faith devotion also worship me, Arjuna, even not observe usual forms.    I object worship, enjoyer Lord. But fail realize true nature must reborn.    Those worship devas go realm devas; worship ancestors united death. Those worship phantoms become phantoms; devotees come me.     Whatever I offered devotion pure heart  leaf, flower, fruit, water  I accept joy.    Whatever do, make offering  food eat, sacrifices make, help give, even suffering.    In way freed bondage karma, results pleasant painful. Then, firm renunciation yoga, heart free, come me.     I look upon creatures equally; none less dear none dear. But worship love live me, I come life them.     Even sinners become holy take refuge alone.    Quickly souls conform dharma attain boundless peace. Never forget this, Arjuna: no one devoted ever come harm.     All take refuge me, whatever birth, race, sex, caste, attain supreme goal; realization attained even society scorns.    Kings sages seek goal devotion. Therefore, born transient forlorn world, give love me.    Fill mind me; love me; serve me; worship always. Seeking heart, last united me.     \f    \f  : Divine Splendor KRISHNA  Listen further, Arjuna, supreme teaching, gives joy. Desiring welfare, O strong-armed warrior, I tell more.    Neither gods sages know origin, I source gods sages come.   Whoever knows Lord creation, without birth beginning, knows truth frees evil.

Wherever find strength, beauty, spiritual power, may sure sprung spark essence.     But use know this, Arjuna? Just remember I am, I support entire cosmos fragment being.     \f     \f  : The Cosmic Vision ARJUNA  Out compassion taught supreme mystery Self. Through words delusion gone.   You explained origin end every creature, O lotus-eyed one, told supreme, limitless existence.    Just described infinite glory, O Lord, I long see it. I want see supreme ruler creation.

Behold gods natural world, many wonders never revealed before.   Behold entire cosmos turning within body, things desire see.    But things cannot seen physical eyes; therefore I give spiritual vision perceive majestic power.    SANJAYA  Having spoken words, Krishna, master yoga, revealed Arjuna exalted, lordly form.    He appeared infinite number faces, ornamented heavenly jewels, displaying unending miracles countless weapons power.    Clothed celestial garments covered garlands, sweet-smelling heavenly fragrances, showed     \fhimself infinite Lord, source wonders, whose face everywhere. If thousand suns rise heavens time, blaze light would resemble splendor supreme spirit.     There, within body God gods, Arjuna saw manifold forms universe united one.    Filled amazement, hair standing end ecstasy, bowed Lord joined palms spoke words.     ARJUNA  O Lord, I see within body gods every kind living creature. I see Brahma, Creator, seated lotus; I see ancient sages celestial serpents.     I see infinite mouths arms, stomachs eyes, embodied every form. I see everywhere, without beginning, middle, end.

The sun moon eyes, mouth fire; radiance warms cosmos.     O Lord, presence fills heavens earth reaches every direction. I see three worlds trembling vision wonderful terrible form.     \fThe gods enter being, calling greeting fear. Great saints sing glory, praying, May well!     The multitudes gods, demigods, demons overwhelmed sight you.    O mighty Lord, sight myriad eyes mouths, arms legs, stomachs fearful teeth, I entire universe shake terror.     O Vishnu, I see eyes shining; open mouth, glitter array colors, body touches sky. I look heart trembles; I lost courage peace mind.     When I see mouths fearful teeth, mouths burning like fires end time, I forget I I no place go. O Lord, support universe; mercy me!     I see sons Dhritarashtra; I see Bhishma, Drona, Karna; I see warriors kings fight.    All rushing awful jaws; I see crushed teeth.    As rivers flow ocean, warriors world passing fiery jaws;    creatures rush destruction like moths flame.     You lap worlds burning mouths swallow them. Filled terrible radiance, O Vishnu, whole creation bursts flames.     Tell are, O Lord terrible form. I bow you; mercy! I want know are, existed creation. Your nature workings confound me.     KRISHNA  I time, destroyer all; I come consume world. Even without participation, warriors gathered die.     \fTherefore arise, Arjuna; conquer enemies enjoy glory sovereignty. I already slain warriors; instrument.     Bhishma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna, many others already slain. Kill I killed. Do not hesitate. Fight battle conquer enemies.     SANJAYA  Having heard words, Arjuna trembled fear. With joined palms bowed Krishna addressed stammering.     ARJUNA  O Krishna, right world delights rejoices praise, saints sages bow evil flees far corners universe.     How could not worship you, O Lord? You eternal spirit, existed Brahma Creator never cease be. Lord gods, abode universe. Changeless, not, beyond duality existence nonexistence.

Whatever I may said lightly, whether playing resting, alone company, sitting together eating,    disrespectful, forgive it, O Krishna. I not know greatness nature, unchanging imperishable.     You father universe, animate inanimate; object worship, greatest guru. There none equal three worlds. Who match power?    O gracious Lord, I prostrate ask blessing. As father forgives son, friend friend, lover beloved, forgive me.     I rejoice seeing never seen before, yet I filled fear vision abode universe. Please let see shining God gods.    Though embodiment creation, let see not thousand arms four, carrying mace discus wearing crown.     KRISHNA  Arjuna, grace united received vision radiant, universal form, without beginning end, no one else ever seen.     Not knowledge Vedas, sacrifice, charity, rituals, even severe asceticism mortal seen seen, O heroic Arjuna.     Do not troubled; not fear terrible form. Let heart satisfied fears dispelled looking I before.     SANJAYA  Having spoken words, Lord assumed gentle form Krishna consoled devotee,     \fafraid. ARJUNA  O Krishna, I seen gentle human form mind composed returned normal.     KRISHNA  It extremely difficult obtain vision had; even gods long always see aspect.    Neither knowledge Vedas, austerity, charity, sacrifice bring vision seen.    But unfailing devotion, Arjuna, know me, see me, attain union me.    Those make supreme goal work act without selfish attachment, devote completely free ill creature, enter me.     \f    \f  : The Way Love ARJUNA  Of steadfast devotees love seek eternal formless Reality, established yoga?    KRISHNA  Those set hearts worship unfailing devotion faith established yoga.    As seek transcendental Reality, without name, without form, contemplating Unmanifested, beyond reach thought feeling,   senses subdued mind serene striving good beings, verily come unto me.    Yet hazardous slow path Unrevealed, difficult physical creatures tread.   But I supreme goal, work renouncing self meditate single-hearted devotion,   I swiftly rescue fragments cycle birth death, consciousness entered me.    Still mind me, still intellect me, without doubt united forever.   If cannot still mind me, learn regular practice meditation.    If lack self-discipline, engage work, selfless service lead last complete fulfillment.    If unable even this, surrender    \fme, disciplining renouncing results actions. Better indeed knowledge mechanical practice. Better knowledge meditation. But better still surrender attachment results, follows immediate peace.     That one I love incapable ill will, friendly compassionate. Living beyond reach I mine pleasure pain,    patient, contented, self-controlled, firm faith, heart mind given  I love.     Not agitating world agitated, stand sway elation, competition, fear: one beloved.     They detached, pure, efficient, impartial, never anxious, selfless undertakings; devotees, dear me.     That one dear runs not pleasant away painful, grieves not, lusts not, lets things come go happen.     That devotee looks upon friend foe equal regard, not buoyed praise cast blame, alike heat cold, pleasure pain, free selfish attachments,    honor dishonor, quiet, ever full, harmony everywhere, firm faith  one dear me.     Those meditate upon immortal dharma I declared it, full faith seeking lifes supreme goal, truly devotees, love great.     \f    \f  : The Field & Knower KRISHNA  The body called field, Arjuna; one knows called Knower field. This knowledge know.   I Knower field everyone, Arjuna. Knowledge field Knower true knowledge.    Listen I explain nature field change takes place within it. I also describe Knower field power.   These truths sung great sages variety ways, expounded precise arguments concerning Brahman.    The field, Arjuna, made following: five areas sense perception; five elements; five sense organs five organs action; three components mind: manas, buddhi, ahamkara; undifferentiated energy evolved.   In field arise desire aversion, pleasure pain, body, intelligence, will.    Those know truly free pride deceit. They gentle, forgiving, upright, pure, devoted spiritual teacher, filled inner strength, self-controlled.   Detached sense objects self-will, learned painful lesson separate birth suffering, old age, disease, death.    Free selfish attachment, not get compulsively entangled even home family. They even-minded good fortune bad.    Their devotion undivided. Enjoying solitude not following crowd, seek me.    \fThis true knowledge, seek Self true end wisdom always. To seek anything else ignorance.     I tell wisdom leads immortality: beginningless Brahman, called neither nonbeing.     It dwells all, every hand foot head, every mouth eye ear universe.    Without senses itself, shines functioning senses. Completely independent, supports things. Beyond gunas, enjoys play.     It near far, within without every creature; moves unmoving.    In subtlety beyond comprehension. It indivisible, yet appears divided separate creatures. Know creator, preserver, destroyer.     Dwelling every heart, beyond darkness. It called light light, object goal knowledge, knowledge itself.     I revealed nature field meaning object true knowledge. Those devoted me, knowing things, united me.     Know prakriti Purusha without beginning, prakriti come gunas changes.    Prakriti agent, cause, effect every action, Purusha seems experience pleasure pain.     Purusha, resting prakriti, witnesses play gunas born prakriti. But attachment gunas leads person born good evil.     Within body supreme Purusha called witness, approver, supporter, enjoyer, supreme Lord, highest Self.     \fWhoever realizes true nature Purusha, prakriti, gunas, whatever path may follow, not born separate again.     Some realize Self within practice meditation, path wisdom, others selfless service.    Others may not know paths; hearing following instructions illumined teacher, go beyond death.     Whatever exists, Arjuna, animate inanimate, born union field Knower.     They alone see truly see Lord every creature, see deathless hearts die.    Seeing Lord everywhere, not harm others. Thus attain supreme goal.     They alone see truly see actions performed prakriti, Self remains unmoved.    When see variety creation rooted unity growing it, attain fulfillment Brahman.     This supreme Self without beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though dwells body, Arjuna, neither acts touched action.    As akasha pervades cosmos remains unstained, Self never tainted though dwells every creature.     As sun lights world, Self dwelling field source light field.    Those who, eye wisdom, distinguish field Knower way freedom bondage prakriti, attain supreme goal.     \f    \f  : Forces Evolution KRISHNA  Let tell wisdom transcends knowledge, saints sages attained perfection.   Those rely wisdom united me. For neither rebirth fear death.    My womb prakriti; I place seed. Thus created things born.   Everything born, Arjuna, comes womb prakriti, I seed-giving father.    It three gunas born prakriti  sattva, rajas, tamas  bind immortal Self body.   Sattva  pure, luminous, free sorrow  binds us attachment happiness wisdom.   Rajas passion, arising selfish desire attachment. These bind Self compulsive action.   Tamas, born ignorance, deludes creatures heedlessness, indolence, sleep.    Sattva binds us happiness; rajas binds us action. Tamas, distorting understanding, binds us delusion.    Sattva predominates rajas tamas transformed. Rajas prevails sattva weak tamas overcome. Tamas prevails rajas sattva dormant.     When sattva predominates, light wisdom shines every gate body.    When rajas predominates, person runs pursuing selfish greedy ends, driven restlessness     \fdesire.    When tamas dominant person lives darkness  slothful, confused, easily infatuated. Those dying state sattva attain pure worlds wise.    Those dying rajas reborn among people driven work. But die tamas conceived wombs ignorant.     The fruit good deeds pure sattvic. The fruit rajas suffering. The fruit tamas ignorance insensitivity.     From sattva comes understanding; rajas, greed. But outcome tamas confusion, infatuation, ignorance.     Those live sattva go upwards; rajas remain are. But immersed tamas sink downwards.     The wise see clearly action work gunas. Knowing gunas, enter union me.     Going beyond three gunas form body, leave behind cycle birth death, decrepitude sorrow, attain immortality.     ARJUNA  What characteristics gone beyond gunas, O Lord? How act? How passed beyond gunas hold?     KRISHNA  They unmoved harmony sattva, activity rajas, delusion tamas. They feel no aversion forces active, crave forces subside.     They remain impartial, undisturbed actions gunas. Knowing gunas act, abide within     \fthemselves not vacillate. Established within themselves, equal pleasure pain, praise blame, kindness unkindness. Clay, rock, gold them.    Alike honor dishonor, alike friend foe, given every selfish pursuit. Such gone beyond gunas.     By serving steadfast love, man woman goes beyond gunas. Such one fit union Brahman.    For I support Brahman, eternal, unchanging, deathless, everlasting dharma, source joy.     \f    \f  : The Supreme Self KRISHNA  Sages speak immutable ashvattha tree, taproot branches below. On tree grow scriptures; seeing source, one knows essence.    Nourished gunas, limbs tree spread below. Sense objects grow limbs buds; roots hanging bind us action world.    The true form tree  essence, beginning, end  not perceived earth. Cut strong-rooted tree sharp ax detachment;   find path not come back again. Seek That, First Cause, universe came long ago.    Not deluded pride, free selfish attachment selfish desire, beyond duality pleasure pain, ever aware Self, wise go forward eternal goal.   Neither sun moon fire add light. This supreme abode, enter not return separate existence.    An eternal part enters world, assuming powers action perception mind made prakriti.   When divine Self enters leaves body, takes along wind carries scent place place.   Using mind, ears, eyes, nose, senses taste touch, Self enjoys sense objects.    \fThe deluded not see Self leaves body dwells within it. They not see Self enjoying sense objects acting gunas. But eye wisdom see.     Those strive resolutely path yoga see Self within. The thoughtless, strive imperfectly, not.     The brightness sun, lights world, brightness moon fire  glory.    With drop energy I enter earth support creatures. Through moon, vessel life-giving fluid, I nourish plants.    I enter breathing creatures dwell within lifegiving breath. I fire stomach digests food.     Entering every heart, I give power remember understand; I take power away. All scriptures lead me; I author wisdom.     In world two orders being: perishable, separate creature changeless spirit.    But beyond another, supreme Self, eternal Lord, enters entire cosmos supports within.     I supreme Self, praised scriptures beyond changing changeless.    Those see supreme Self see truly. They found source wisdom, Arjuna, worship heart.     I shared profound truth you, Arjuna. Those understand attain wisdom; done done.     \f    \f  : Two Paths KRISHNA  Be fearless pure; never waver determination dedication spiritual life. Give freely. Be self-controlled, sincere, truthful, loving, full desire serve. Realize truth scriptures; learn detached take joy renunciation.   Do not get angry harm living creature, compassionate gentle; show good all.   Cultivate vigor, patience, will, purity; avoid malice pride. Then, Arjuna, achieve divine destiny.    Other qualities, Arjuna, make person inhuman: hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty, ignorance.    The divine qualities lead freedom; demonic, bondage. But not grieve, Arjuna; born divine attributes.    Some people divine tendencies, others demonic. I described divine length, Arjuna; listen I describe demonic.    The demonic things avoid avoid things do. They no sense uprightness, purity, truth.    There no God, say, no truth, no spiritual law, no moral order. The basis life sex; else be?   Holding distorted views, possessing scant discrimination, become enemies world, causing suffering destruction.    \fHypocritical, proud, arrogant, living delusion clinging deluded ideas, insatiable desires, pursue unclean ends.    Although burdened fears end death, still maintain complete assurance, Gratification lust highest life offer.     Bound sides scheming anxiety, driven anger greed, amass means hoard money satisfaction cravings.     I got today, say; tomorrow I shall get that. This wealth mine, mine too.    I destroyed enemies. I shall destroy others too! Am I not like God? I enjoy I want. I successful. I powerful. I happy.    I rich well-born. Who equal me? I perform sacrifices give gifts, rejoice generosity. This go on, deluded ignorance.    Bound greed entangled web delusion, whirled fragmented mind, fall dark hell.     Self-important, obstinate, swept away pride wealth, ostentatiously perform sacrifices without regard purpose.    Egotistical, violent, arrogant, lustful, angry, envious everyone, abuse presence within bodies bodies others.     Life life I cast malicious, hateful, cruel, degraded wombs similar demonic natures.    Birth birth find demonic tendencies. Degraded way, Arjuna, fail reach fall lower still.     There three gates self-destructive hell: lust, anger, greed. Renounce three.    Those escape three gates darkness, Arjuna, seek best attain lifes supreme goal.    Others disregard teachings scriptures. Driven selfish desire, miss goal life, miss even happiness success.     \fTherefore let scriptures guide not do. Understand teachings; act accordance them.     \f    \f  : The Power Faith ARJUNA  O Krishna, state disregard scriptures still worship faith? Do act sattva, rajas, tamas?    KRISHNA  Every creature born faith kind, either sattvic, rajasic, tamasic. Listen, I describe you.    Our faith conforms nature, Arjuna. Human nature made faith. A person shraddha is.    Those sattvic worship forms God; rajasic worship power wealth. Those tamasic worship spirits ghosts.   Some invent harsh penances. Motivated hypocrisy egotism,   torture innocent bodies dwells within. Blinded strength passion, act think like demons.    The three kinds faith express habits hold them: food like, work do, disciplines practice, gifts give. Listen, I describe different ways.    Sattvic people enjoy food mild, tasty, substantial, agreeable, nourishing, food promotes health, strength, cheerfulness, longevity.   Rajasic people like food salty bitter, hot, sour, spicy  food promotes pain, discomfort, disease.       \fTamasic people like overcooked, stale, leftover, impure food, food lost taste nutritional value. The sattvic perform sacrifices entire mind fixed purpose sacrifice. Without thought reward, follow teachings scriptures.    The rajasic perform sacrifices sake show good bring them.    The tamasic perform sacrifices ignoring letter spirit. They omit proper prayers, proper offerings, proper food, proper faith.     To offer service gods, good, wise, spiritual teacher; purity, honesty, continence, nonviolence: disciplines body.    To offer soothing words, speak truly, kindly, helpfully, study scriptures: disciplines speech.    Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, purity: disciplines mind.     When three levels self-discipline practiced without attachment results, spirit great faith, sages call practice sattvic.    Disciplines practiced order gain respect, honor, admiration rajasic; undependable transitory effects.    Disciplines practiced gain power others, confused belief torture oneself spiritual, tamasic.     Giving simply right give, without thought return, proper time, proper circumstances, worthy person, sattvic giving.    Giving regrets expectation receiving favor getting something return rajasic.    Giving inappropriate time, inappropriate circumstances, unworthy person, without affection respect, tamasic.     Om Tat Sat: three words represent Brahman, come priests scriptures sacrifice.    Those follow Vedas, therefore, always repeat word Om offering sacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, giving gifts.    Those seeking liberation not personal benefit add word Tat     \fwhen performing acts worship, discipline, charity.    Sat means is; also indicates goodness. Therefore used describe worthy deed. To steadfast self-sacrifice, self-discipline, giving sat. To act accordance three sat well.    But engage sacrifice, self-discipline, giving without good faith asat, without worth goodness, either life next.     \f    \f  : Freedom & Renunciation ARJUNA  O Krishna, destroyer evil, please explain sannyasa tyaga one kind renunciation differs another.    KRISHNA  To refrain selfish acts one kind renunciation, called sannyasa; renounce fruit action another, called tyaga.    Among wise, say action renounced evil. Others say certain kinds action  self-sacrifice, giving, self-discipline  continued.   Listen, Arjuna, I explain three kinds tyaga conclusions concerning them.    Self-sacrifice, giving, self-discipline not renounced, purify thoughtful.   Yet even these, Arjuna, performed without desire selfish rewards. This essential.    To renounce ones responsibilities not fitting. The wise call deluded renunciation tamasic.   To avoid action fear difficulty physical discomfort rajasic. There no reward renunciation.   But fulfill responsibilities knowing obligatory, time desiring nothing  sattvic renunciation.    Those endowed sattva clearly understand meaning renunciation not waver. They not intimidated unpleasant work, seek job pleasant.    \fAs long one body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation giving desire personal reward.    Those attached personal reward reap consequences actions: pleasant, unpleasant, mixed. But renounce every desire personal reward go beyond reach karma.     Listen, Arjuna, I explain five elements necessary accomplishment every action, taught wisdom Sankhya.    The body, means, ego, performance act, divine will:    five factors actions, right wrong, thought, word, deed.     Those not understand think separate agents. With crude intellects fail see truth.    The person free ego, attained purity heart, though slays people, not slay not bound action.     Knowledge, thing known, knower: three promote action. The means, act itself, doer: three totality action.    Knowledge, action, doer described according gunas. Listen, I explain distinctions you.     Sattvic knowledge sees one indestructible Being beings, unity underlying multiplicity creation.    Rajasic knowledge sees things creatures separate distinct.    Tamasic knowledge, lacking sense perspective, sees one small part mistakes whole.     Work performed fulfill ones obligations, without thought personal reward whether job pleasant unpleasant, sattvic.    Work prompted selfish desire self-will, full stress, rajasic.    Work undertaken blindly, without consideration consequences, waste, injury others, ones capacities, tamasic.     \fSattvic workers free egotism selfish attachments, full enthusiasm fortitude success failure alike.    Rajasic workers strong personal desires crave rewards actions. Covetous, impure, destructive, easily swept away fortune, good bad.    Tamasic workers undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, dishonest, lazy. They easily depressed prone procrastination.     Listen, Arjuna, I describe three types understanding will.     To know act refrain action, right action wrong, brings security insecurity, brings freedom bondage: signs sattvic intellect.     The rajasic intellect confuses right wrong actions, cannot distinguish done not done.    The tamasic intellect shrouded darkness, utterly reversing right wrong wherever turns.     The sattvic will, developed meditation, keeps prana, mind, senses vital harmony.    The rajasic will, conditioned selfish desire, pursues wealth, pleasure, respectability.    The tamasic shows obstinate ignorance, sloth, fear, grief, depression, conceit.     Now listen, Arjuna: also three kinds happiness. By sustained effort, one comes end sorrow.    That seems like poison first, tastes like nectar end  joy sattva, born mind peace itself.    Pleasure senses seems like nectar first, bitter poison end. This kind happiness comes rajasic.    Those tamasic draw pleasures sleep, indolence, intoxication. Both beginning end, happiness delusion.     \fNo creature, whether born earth among gods heaven, free conditioning three gunas.    The different responsibilities found social order  distinguishing brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, shudra  roots conditioning.     The responsibilities brahmins born, based nature, self-control, tranquility, purity heart, patience, humility, learning, austerity, wisdom, faith.     The qualities kshatriyas, based nature, courage, strength, fortitude, dexterity, generosity, leadership, firm resolve never retreat battle.    The occupations suitable vaishya agriculture, dairying, trade. The proper work shudra service.     By devotion ones particular duty, everyone attain perfection. Let tell how.    By performing ones work, one worships Creator dwells every creature. Such worship brings person fulfillment.     It better perform ones duties imperfectly master duties another. By fulfilling obligations born with, person never comes grief.    No one abandon duties sees defects them. Every action, every activity, surrounded defects fire surrounded smoke.     One free selfish attachments, mastered passions, attains supreme perfection freedom action.    Listen I shall explain now, Arjuna, one attained perfection also attains Brahman, supreme consummation wisdom.     Unerring discrimination, sovereign senses passions, free clamor likes dislikes,    one leads simple, self-reliant life based meditation, controlling speech, body, mind.     \fFree self-will, aggressiveness, arrogance, anger, lust possess people things, peace others enter unitive state.    United Brahman, ever joyful, beyond reach desire sorrow, equal regard every living creature attain supreme devotion me.    By loving come know truly; know glory enter boundless being.    All acts performed service, grace win eternal life.     Make every act offering me; regard protector. Relying interior discipline, meditate always.    Remembering me, shall overcome difficulties grace. But not heed self-will, nothing avail you.     If egotistically say, I not fight battle, resolve useless; nature drive it.    Your karma, born nature, drive even not wish do, delusion.     The Lord dwells hearts creatures whirls round upon wheel maya.    Run refuge strength, peace profound grace.     I give precious words wisdom; reflect choose.    These last words I shall speak you, dear one, spiritual fulfillment. You dear me.     Be aware always, adore me, make every act offering me, shall come me; I promise; dear me.    Abandon supports look protection. I shall purify sins past; not grieve.     Do not share wisdom anyone lacks devotion self-control, lacks desire learn, scoffs me.    Those teach supreme mystery Gita love perform     \fthe greatest act love; come without doubt.    No one render devoted service; no one earth dear me. Those meditate holy words worship wisdom devotion.    Even listen faith, free doubts, find happier world good people dwell.     Have listened attention? Are free doubts confusion?     ARJUNA  You dispelled doubts delusions, I understand grace. My faith firm now, I will.     SANJAYA  This dialogue I heard Krishna, son Vasudeva, Arjuna, great-hearted son Pritha. The wonder makes hair stand end!

            "﻿ chapter i dhritirashtra: ranged thus for battle on the sacred plain - on kurukshetra - say, sanjaya! say what wrought my people, and the pandavas? sanjaya: when he beheld the host of pandavas, raja duryodhana to drona drew, and speak these words:”ah, guru! see this line, how vast it is of pandu fighting-men, embattled by the son of drupada, your scholar in the war! therein stand ranked chiefs like arjuna, like to bhima chiefs, benders of bows; virata, yuyudhan, drupada, eminent upon his car, dhrishtaket, chekitan, kasi stout lord, purujit, kuntibhoj, and saivya, with yudhamanyu, and uttamauj subhadra child; and drupadi;-all famed! all mounted on their shining chariots! on our side, too,--you best of brahmaan! see excellent chiefs, commanders of my line, whose names i joy to count: yourself the first, then bhishma, karna, kripa fierce in fight, vikarna, aswatthaman; next to these strong saumadatti, with full many more valiant and tried, ready this day to die for me their king, each with his weapon grasped, each skilful in the field. weakest-meseems-our battle shows where bhishma holds command, and bhima, fronting him, something too strong! have care our captains nigh to bhishma ranks prepare what help they may! now, blow my shell!\" then, at the signal of the aged king, with blare to wake the blood, rolling around like to a lion roar, the trumpeter blew the great conch; and, at the noise of it, trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns burst into sudden clamour; as the blasts of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed! then might be seen, upon their car of gold yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells, krishna the god, arjuna at his side: krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch carved of the \"giant bone;\" arjuna blew indra loud gift; bhima the terrible - wolf-bellied bhima-blew a long reed-conch; and yudhisthira, kunti's blameless son, winded a mighty shell, \"victory voice;\" and nakula blew shrill upon his conch named the \"sweet-sounding,\" sahadev on his called\"gem-bedecked,\" and kasi prince on his. sikhandi on his car, dhrishtadyumn, virata, satyaki the unsubdued, drupada, with his sons, (o lord of earth!) long-armed subhadra children, all blew loud, so that the clangour shook their foemen hearts, with quaking earth and thundering heaven. then ‚twas- beholding dhritirashtra battle set, weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war instant to break-arjun, whose ensign-badge was hanuman the monkey, speak this thing to krishna the divine, his charioteer: \"drive, dauntless one! to yonder open ground betwixt the armies; i would see more nigh these who will fight with us, those we must slay to-day, in war's arbitrament; for, sure, on bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain, obeying dhritirashtra sinful son.\" thus, by arjuna prayed, (o bharata!) between the hosts that heavenly charioteer drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds where bhishma led,and drona,and their lords. \"see!\" speak he to arjuna, \"where they stand, your kindred of the kurus:\" and the prince marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house, grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons, cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed with friends and honoured elders; some this side, some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed, such kith grown enemies-arjuna's heart melted with pity, while he uttered this: arjuna. krishna! as i behold, come here to shed their common blood, yon concourse of our kin, my members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth, a shudder thrills my body, and my hair bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns my skin to parching; hardly may i stand; the life within me seems to swim and faint; nothing do i foresee save woe and wail! it is not good, o keshav! nought of good can spring from mutual slaughter! lo, i hate triumph and domination, wealth and ease, thus sadly won! aho! what victory can bring delight, govinda! what rich spoils could profit; what rule recompense; what span of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood? seeing that these stand here, ready to die, for whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased, and power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons, brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law, elders and friends! shall i deal death on these even yough they seek to slay us? not one blow, o madhusudan! will i strike to gain the rule of all three worlds; then, how much less to seize an earthly kingdom! killing these must breed but anguish, krishna! if they be guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths; their sins will light on us, if we shall slay those sons of dhritirashtra, and our kin; what peace could come of that, o madhava? for if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath, these cannot see, or will not see, the sin of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain, how should not we, who see, shun such a crime - we who perceive the guilt and feel the shame - o you delight of men, janardana? by overthrow of houses perisheth their sweet continuous household piety, and-rites neglected, piety extinct - enters impiety upon that home; its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes, sending a hell-ward road that family, and whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath. nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors fall from their place of peace, being bereft of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water. so teach our holy hymns. thus, if we slay kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power, ahovat! what an evil fault it were! better i deem it, if my kinsmen strike, to face them weaponless, and bare my breast to shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow. so speaking, in the face of those two hosts, arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat, and let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart. here endeth chapter i. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"arjun-vishad,\" or \"the book of the distress of arjuna.\" chapter ii sanjaya. him, filled with such compassion and such grief, with eyes tear-dimmed, despondent, in stern words the driver, madhusudan, thus addressed: krishna. how hath this weakness taken you? whence springs the inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave, barring the path of virtue? nay, arjun! forbid yourself to feebleness! it mars your warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit! wake! be yourself! arise, scourge of your foes! arjuna. how can i, in the battle, shoot with shafts on bhishma, or on drona-o you chief!-- both worshipful, both honourable men? better to live on beggar's bread with those we love alive, than taste their blood in rich feasts spread, and guiltily survive! ah! were it worse-who knows?--to be victor or vanquished here, when those confront us angrily whose death leaves living drear? in pity lost, by doubtings tossed, my youghts-distracted-turn to you, the guide i reverence most, that i may counsel learn: i know not what would heal the grief burned into soul and sense, if i were earthes unchallenged chief - a god - and these gone thence! sanjaya. so speak arjuna to the lord of hearts, and sighing,\"i will not fight!\" held silence then. to whom, with tender smile, (o bharata! ) while the prince wept despairing ‚twixt those hosts, krishna made answer in divinest verse: krishna. you grievest where no grief should be! you speak words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart mourn not for those that live, nor those that die. nor i, nor you, nor any one of these, ever was not, nor ever will not be, for ever and for ever afterwards. all, that doth live, lives always! to man frame as there come infancy and youth and age, so come there raisings-up and layings-down of other and of other life-abodes, which the wise know, and fear not. this that irks - your sense-life, thrilling to the elements - bringing you heat and cold, sorrows and joys, ‚this is brief and mutable! bear with it, prince! as the wise bear. the soul which is not moved, the soul that with a strong and constant calm takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently, lives in the life undying! that which is can never cease to be; that which is not will not exist. to see this truth of both is theirs who part essence from accident, substance from shadow. indestructible, learn you! the life is, spreading life through all; it cannot anywhere, by any means, be anywise diminished, stayed, or changed. but for these fleeting frames which it informs with spirit deathless, endless, infinite, they perish. let them perish, prince! and fight! he who shall say, \"lo! i have slain a man!\" he who shall think, \"lo! i am slain!\" those both know naught! life cannot slay. life is not slain! never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never; never was time it was not; end and beginning are dreams! birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever; death hath not touched it at all, dead yough the house of it seems! who know it exhaustless, self-sustained, immortal, indestructible,--shall such say, \"i have killed a man, or caused to kill?\" nay, but as when one layeth his worn-out robes away, and taking new ones, sayeth, \"these will i wear to-day!\" so putteth by the spirit lightly its garb of flesh, and passeth to inherit a residence afresh. i say to you weapons reach not the life; flame burns it not, waters cannot overwhelm, nor dry winds wither it. impenetrable, unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched, immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure, invisible, ineffable, by word and yought uncompassed, ever all itself, thus is the soul declared! how wilt you, then,-- knowing it so,--grieve when you should not grieve? how, if you hearest that the man new-dead is, like the man new-born, still living man - one same, existent spirit - wilt you weep? the end of birth is death; the end of death is birth: this is ordained! and mournest you, chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls which could not otherwise befall? the birth of living things comes unperceived; the death comes unperceived; between them, beings perceive: what is there sorrowful herein, dear prince? wonderful, wistful, to contemplate! difficult, doubtful, to speak upon! strange and great for tongue to relate, mystical hearing for every one! nor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is, when seeing, and saying, and hearing are done! this life within all living things, my prince! hides beyond harm; scorn you to suffer, then, for that which cannot suffer. do your part! be mindful of your name, and tremble not! nought better can betide a martial soul than lawful war; happy the warrior to whom comes joy of battle - comes, as now, glorious and fair, unsought; opening for him a gateway unto heaven. but, if you shunn'st this honourable field - a kshattriya - if, knowing your duty and your task, you biddest duty and task go by - that shall be sin! and those to come shall speak you infamy from age to age; but infamy is worse for men of noble blood to bear than death! the chiefs upon their battle-chariots will deem ‚twas fear that drove you from the fray. of those who held you mighty-souled the scorn you must abide, while all yours enemies will scatter bitter speech of you, to mock the valour which you hadst; what fate could fall more grievously than this? either - being killed - you wilt win swarga safety, or - alive and victor - you wilt reign an earthly king. therefore, arise, you son of kunti! brace yours arm for conflict, nerve your heart to meet - as things alike to you - pleasure or pain, profit or ruin, victory or defeat: so minded, gird you to the fight, for so you shalt not sin! thus far i speak to you as from the \"sankhya\" - unspiritually - hear now the deeper teaching of the yog, which holding, understanding, you shalt burst your karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds. here shall no end be hindered, no hope marred, no loss be feared: faith - yea, a little faith - shall save you from the anguish of your dread. here, glory of the kurus! shines one rule - one steadfast rule - while shifting souls have laws many and hard. specious, but wrongful deem the speech of those ill-taught ones who extol the letter of their vedas, saying, \"this is all we have, or need;\" being weak at heart with wants, seekers of heaven: which comes - they say - as \"fruit of good deeds done;\" promising men much profit in new births for works of faith; in various rites abounding; following whereon large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power; albeit, who wealth and power do most desire least fixity of soul have such, least hold on heavenly meditation. much these teach, from veds, concerning the \"three qualities;\" but you, be free of the \"three qualities,\" free of the \"pairs of opposites,\" and free from that sad righteousness which calculates; self-ruled, arjuna! simple, sathis isfied! look! like as when a tank pours water forth to suit all needs, so do these brahmaan draw text for all wants from tank of holy writ. but you, want not! ask not! find full reward of doing right in right! let right deeds be your motive, not the fruit which comes from them. and live in action! labour! make yours acts your piety, casting all self aside, contemning gain and merit; equable in good or evil: equability is yog, is piety! yet, the right act is less, far less, than the right-thinking mind. seek refuge in your soul; have there your heaven! scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts! the mind of pure devotion - even here - casts equally aside good deeds and bad, passing above them. unto pure devotion devote yourself: with perfect meditation comes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise - more certainly because they seek no gain - forth from the bands of body, step by step, to highest seats of bliss. when your firm soul hath shaken off those tangled oracles which ignorantly guide, then shall it soar to high neglect of what's denied or said, this way or that way, in doctrinal writ. troubled no longer by the priestly lore, safe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent on meditation. this is yog - and peace! arjuna. what is his mark who hath that steadfast heart, confirmed in holy meditation? how know we his speech, kesava? sits he, moves he like other men? krishna. when one, o pritha son! abandoning desires which shake the mind - finds in his soul full comfort for his soul, he hath attained the yog - that man is such! in sorrows not dejected, and in joys not overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress of passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms of lofty contemplation;--such an one is muni, is the sage, the true recluse! he who to none and nowhere overbound by ties of flesh, takes evil things and good neither desponding nor exulting, such bears wisdom plainest mark! he who shall draw as the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe under its shield, his five frail senses back under the spirit buckler from the world which else assails them, such an one, my prince! hath wisdom mark! things that solicit sense hold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes, the appetites of him who lives beyond depart,--aroused no more. yet may it chance, o son of kunti! that a governed mind shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest strong self-control by the roots. let him regain his kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit on me intent. that man alone is wise who keeps the mastery of himself! if one ponders on objects of the sense, there springs attraction; from attraction grows desire, desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds recklessness; then the memory - all betrayed - lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind, till purpose, mind, and man are all undone. but, if one deals with objects of the sense not loving and not hating, making them serve his free soul, which rests serenely lord, lo! such a man comes to tranquillity; and out of that tranquillity shall rise the end and healing of his earthly pains, since the will governed sets the soul at peace. the soul of the ungoverned is not his, nor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked, how grows serenity? and, wanting that, whence shall he hope for happiness? the mind that gives itself to follow shows of sense see its helm of wisdom rent away, and, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives to wreck and death. only with him, great prince! whose senses are not swayed by things of sense - only with him who holds his mastery, shows wisdom perfect. what is midnight-gloom to unenlightened souls shines wakeful day to his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day is known for night, thick night of ignorance, to his true-seeing eyes. such is the saint! and like the ocean, day by day receiving floods from all lands, which never overflows its boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving, fed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;-- so is the perfect one! to his soul ocean the world of sense pours streams of witchery; they leave him as they find, wiyout commotion, taking their tribute, but remaining sea. yea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh lives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free from pride, from passion, from the sin of \"self,\" toucheth tranquillity! o pritha son! that is the state of brahma! there rests no dread when that last step is reached! live where he will, die when he may, such passeth from all ‚plaining, to blest nirvana, with the gods, attaining. here endeth chapter ii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"sankhya-yog,\" or \"the book of doctrines.\" chapter iii arjuna. you whom all mortals praise, janardana! if meditation be a nobler thing than action, wherefore, then, great kesava! dost you impel me to this dreadful fight? now am i by your doubtful speech disturbed! tell me one thing, and tell me certainly; by what road shall i find the better end? krishna. i told you, blameless lord! there be two paths shown to this world; two schools of wisdom. first the sankhya, which doth save in way of works prescribed by reason; next, the yog, which bids attain by meditation, spiritually: yet these are one! no man shall ‚scape from act by shunning action; nay, and none shall come by mere renouncements unto perfectness. nay, and no jot of time, at any time, rests any actionless; his nature law compels him, even unwilling, into act; [for yought is act in fancy]. he who sits suppressing all the instruments of flesh, yet in his idle heart thinking on them, plays the inept and guilty hypocrite: but he who, with strong body serving mind, gives up his mortal powers to woryour work, not seeking gain, arjuna! such an one is honourable. do yours allotted task! work is more excellent than idleness; the body life proceeds not, lacking work. there is a task of holiness to do, unlike world-binding toil, which bind not the faithful soul; such earthly duty do free from desire, and you shalt well perform your heavenly purpose. speak prajapati - in the beginning, when all men were made, and, with mankind, the sacrifice - \"do this! work! sacrifice! increase and multiply with sacrifice! this shall be kamaduk, your ‚cow of plenty,' giving back her milk of all abundance. worship the gods thereby; the gods shall yield you grace. those meats ye crave the gods will grant to labour, when it pays tithes in the altar-flame. but if one eats fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly heaven no gift of toil, that thief steals from his world.\" who eat of food after their sacrifice are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast all for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin. by food the living live; food comes of rain, and rain comes by the pious sacrifice, and sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil; thus action is of brahmaa, who is one, the only, all-pervading; at all times present in sacrifice. he that abstains to help the rolling wheels of this great world, glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life, shameful and vain. existing for himself, self-concentrated, serving self alone, no part hath he in aught; nothing achieved, nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope of help for all the living things of earth depends from him. therefore, your task prescribed with spirit unattached gladly perform, since in performance of plain duty man mounts to his highest bliss. by works alone janak and ancient saints reached blessedness! moreover, for the upholding of your kind, action you should embrace. what the wise choose the unwise people take; what best men do the multitude will follow. look on me, you son of pritha! in the three wide worlds i am not bound to any toil, no height awaits to scale, no gift remains to gain, yet i act here! and, if i acted not - earnest and watchful - those that look to me for guidance, sinking back to sloth again because i slumbered, would decline from good, and i should break earthes order and commit her offspring unto ruin, bharata! even as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense, so let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set to bring the world deliverance, and its bliss; not sowing in those simple, busy hearts seed of despair. yea! let each play his part in all he finds to do, with unyoked soul. all things are everywhere by nature wrought in interaction of the qualities. the fool, cheated by self, thinks, \"this i did\" and \"that i wrought; \"but - ah, you strong-armed prince!-- a better-lessoned mind, knowing the play of visible things within the world of sense, and how the qualities must qualify, stand aloof even from his acts. the untaught live mixed with them, knowing not nature way, of highest aims unwitting, slow and dull. those make you not to stumble, having the light; but all your dues discharging, for my sake, with meditation centred inwardly, seeking no profit, sathis isfied, serene, heedless of issue - fight! they who shall keep my ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts, have quittance from all issue of their acts; but those who disregard my ordinance, thinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss, confused and foolish. ‚sooth, the instructed one doth of his kind, following what fits him most: and lower creatures of their kind; in vain contending ‚gainst the law. needs must it be the objects of the sense will stir the sense to like and dislike, yet the enlightened man yields not to these, knowing them enemies. finally, this is better, that one do his own task as he may, even yough he fail, than take tasks not his own, yough they seem good. to die performing duty is no ill; but who seeks other roads shall wander still. arjuna. yet tell me, teacher! by what force doth man go to his ill, unwilling; as if one pushed him that evil path? krishna. kama it is! passion it is! born of the darknesses, which pusheth him. mighty of appetite, sinful, and strong is this!--man enemy! as smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust mars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds the babe unborn, so is the world of things foiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh. the wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe it is of wisdom, wearing countless forms, fair but deceitful, subtle as a flame. sense, mind, and reason - these, o arjuna! are booty for it; in its play with these it maddens man, beguiling, blinding him. therefore, you noblest child of bharata! govern your heart! constrain the entangled sense! resist the false, soft sinfulness which saps knowledge and judgment! yea, the world is strong, but what discerns it stronger, and the mind strongest; and high o'er all the ruling soul. wherefore, perceiving him who reigns supreme, put forth full force of soul in your own soul! fight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear hero! slay what haunts you in fond shapes, and would betray! here endeth chapter iii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"karma-yog,\" or \"the book of virtue in work.\" chapter iv krishna. this deathless yoga, this deep union, i taught vivaswata, the lord of light; vivaswata to manu gave it; he to ikshwaku; so passed it down the line of all my royal rishis. then, with years, the truth grew dim and perished, noble prince! now once again to you it is declared - this ancient lore, this mystery supreme - seeing i find you votary and friend. arjuna. your birth, dear lord, was in these later days, and bright vivaswata preceded time! how shall i comprehend this thing you sayest, \"from the beginning it was i who taught?\" krishna. manifold the renewals of my birth have been, arjuna! and of your births, too! but mine i know, and yours you knowest not, o slayer of your foes! albeit i be unborn, undying, indestructible, the lord of all things living; not the less - by maya, by my magic which i stamp on floating nature-forms, the primal vast - i come, and go, and come. when righteousness declines, o bharata! when wickedness is strong, i rise, from age to age, and take visible shape, and move a man with men, succouring the good, thrusting the evil back, and setting virtue on her seat again. who knows the truth touching my births on earth and my divine work, when he quits the flesh puts on its load no more, falls no more down to earthly birth: to me he comes, dear prince! many there be who come! from fear set free, from anger, from desire; keeping their hearts fixed upon me - my faithful - purified by sacred flame of knowledge. such as these mix with my being. whoso worship me, them i exalt; but all men everywhere shall fall into my path; albeit, those souls which seek reward for works, make sacrifice now, to the lower gods. i say to you here have they their reward. but i am he made the four castes, and portioned them a place after their qualities and gifts. yea, i created, the reposeful; i that live immortally, made all those mortal births: for works soil not my essence, being works wrought uninvolved. who knows me acting thus unchained by action, action binds not him; and, so perceiving, all those saints of old worked, seeking for deliverance. work you as, in the days gone by, your fathers did. you sayst, perplexed, it hath been asked before by singers and by sages, \"what is act, and what inaction? \"i will teach you this, and, knowing, you shalt learn which work doth save needs must one rightly meditate those three - doing,--not doing,--and undoing. here thorny and dark the path is! he who sees how action may be rest, rest action - he is wisest ‚mid his kind; he hath the truth! he doeth well, acting or resting. freed in all his works from prickings of desire, burned clean in act by the white fire of truth, the wise call that man wise; and such an one, renouncing fruit of deeds, always content. always self-sathis isfying, if he works, doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul, which - quit of fear and hope - subduing self - rejecting outward impulse - yielding up to body need nothing save body, dwells sinless amid all sin, with equal calm taking what may befall, by grief unmoved, unmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same in good and evil fortunes; nowise bound by bond of deeds. nay, but of such an one, whose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate, whose heart is set on truth - of such an one what work he does is work of sacrifice, which passeth purely into ash and smoke consumed upon the altar! all is then god! the sacrifice is brahma, the ghee and grain are brahma, the fire is brahma, the flesh it eats is brahma, and unto brahma attaineth he who, in such office, meditates on brahma. some votaries there be who serve the gods with flesh and altar-smoke; but other some who, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite with will of worship. of the which be they who, in white flame of continence, consume joys of the sense, delights of eye and ear, forgoing tender speech and sound of song: and they who, kindling fires with torch of truth, burn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss of youth and love, renouncing happiness: and they who lay for offering there their wealth, their penance, meditation, piety, their steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore painfully gained with long austerities: and they who, making silent sacrifice, draw in their breath to feed the flame of yought, and breathe it forth to waft the heart on high, governing the ventage of each entering air lest one sigh pass which help not the soul: and they who, day by day denying needs, lay life itself upon the altar-flame, burning the body wan. lo! all these keep the rite of offering, as if they slew victims; and all thereby efface much sin. yea! and who feed on the immortal food left of such sacrifice, to brahmaa pass, to the unending. but for him that makes no sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot even in the present world. how should he share another, o you glory of your line? in sight of brahmaa all these offerings are spread and are accepted! comprehend that all proceed by act; for knowing this, you shalt be quit of doubt. the sacrifice which knowledge pays is better than great gifts offered by wealth, since gifts' worth - o my prince! lies in the mind which gives, the will that serves: and these are gained by reverence, by strong search, by humble heed of those who see the truth and teach it. knowing truth, your heart no more will ache with error, for the truth shall show all things subdued to you, as you to me. moreover, son of pandu! wert you worst of all wrong-doers, this fair ship of truth should bear you safe and dry across the sea of your transgressions. as the kindled flame feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash, so unto ash, arjuna! unto nought the flame of knowledge wastes works' dross away! there is no purifier like thereto in all this world, and he who seeketh it shall find it - being grown perfect - in himself. believing, he receives it when the soul masters itself, and cleaves to truth, and comes - possessing knowledge - to the higher peace, the uttermost repose. but those untaught, and those wiyout full faith, and those who fear are shent; no peace is here or other where, no hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts. he that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt, disparting self from service, soul from works, enlightened and emancipate, my prince! works fetter him no more! cut then atwain with sword of wisdom, son of bharata! this doubt that binds your heart-beats! cleave the bond born of your ignorance! be bold and wise! give yourself to the field with me! arise! here endeth chapter iv. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"jnana yog,\" or \"the book of the religion of knowledge,\" chapter v arjuna. yet, krishna! at the one time you dost laud surcease of works, and, at another time, service through work. of these twain plainly tell which is the better way? krishna. to cease from works is well, and to do works in holiness is well; and both conduct to bliss supreme; but of these twain the better way is his who working piously refraineth not. that is the true renouncer, firm and fixed, who - seeking nought, rejecting nought - dwells proof against the \"opposites.\" o valiant prince! in doing, such breaks lightly from all deed: ‚this is the new scholar talks as they were two, this sankhya and this yoga: wise men know who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both! the region of high rest which sankhyans reach yogins attain. who sees these twain as one sees with clear eyes! yet such abstraction, chief! is hard to win wiyout much holiness. whoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled, pure-hearted, lord of senses and of self, lost in the common life of all which lives - a \"yogayukt\" - he is a saint who wends straightway to brahma. such an one is not touched by taint of deeds. \"nought of myself i do!\" thus will he think-who holds the truth of truths - in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling; when he eats, or goes, or breathes; slumbers or talks, holds fast or loosens, opes his eyes or shuts; always assured \"this is the sense-world plays with senses.\"he that acts in yought of brahma, detaching end from act, with act content, the world of sense can no more stain his soul than waters mar the enamelled lotus-leaf. with life, with heart, with mind,-nay, with the help of all five senses - letting selfhood go - yogins toil ever towards their souls' release. such votaries, renouncing fruit of deeds, gain endless peace: the unvowed, the passion-bound, seeking a fruit from works, are fastened down. the embodied sage, withdrawn within his soul, at every act sits godlike in \"the town which hath nine gateways,\" neither doing aught nor causing any deed. this world's lord makes neither the work, nor passion for the work, nor lust for fruit of work; the man own self pushes to these! the master of this world takes on himself the good or evil deeds of no man - dwelling beyond! mankind errs here by folly, darkening knowledge. but, for whom that darkness of the soul is chased by light, splendid and clear shines manifest the truth as if a sun of wisdom sprang to shed its beams of dawn. him meditating still, him seeking, with him blended, stayed on him, the souls illuminated take that road which hath no turning back - their sins flung off by strength of faith. [who will may have this light; who hath it sees.] to him who wisely sees, the brahmaan with his scrolls and sanctities, the cow, the elephant, the unclean dog, the outcast gorging dog's meat, are all one. the world is overcome - aye! even here! by such as fix their faith on unity. the sinless brahmaa dwells in unity, and they in brahmaa. be not over-glad attaining joy, and be not over-sad encountering grief, but, stayed on brahmaa, still constant let each abide! the sage whose sou holds off from outer contacts, in himself finds bliss; to brahmaa joined by piety, his spirit tastes eternal peace. the joys springing from sense-life are but quickening wombs which breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end! the wise mind takes no pleasure, arjuna! in such as those! but if a man shall learn, even while he lives and bears his body chain, to master lust and anger, he is blest! he is the yukta; he hath happiness, contentment, light, within: his life is merged in brahmaa's life; he doth nirvana touch! thus go the rishis unto rest, who dwell with sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts governed and calm. glad in all good they live, nigh to the peace of god; and all those live who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath, subduing self and senses, knowing the soul! the saint who shuts outside his placid soul all touch of sense, letting no contact through; whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows, whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn equal and slow through nostrils still and close; that one-with organs, heart, and mind constrained, bent on deliverance, having put away passion, and fear, and rage;--hath, even now, obtained deliverance, ever and ever freed. yea! for he knows me who am he that heeds the sacrifice and worship, god revealed; and he who heeds not, being lord of worlds, lover of all that lives, god unrevealed, wherein who will shall find surety and shield! here ends chapter v. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"karmasanyasayog,\" or \"the book of religion by renouncing fruit of works.\" chapter vi krishna. therefore, who doeth work rightful to do, not seeking gain from work, that man, o prince! is sanyasi and yogi - both in one and he is neither who lights not the flame of sacrifice, nor setteth hand to task. regard as true renouncer him that makes worship by work, for who renounceth not works not as yogin. so is that well said: \"by works the votary doth rise to faith, and saintship is the ceasing from all works; because the perfect yogin acts - but acts unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds, setting result aside. let each man raise the self by soul, not trample down his self, since soul that is self's friend may grow self's foe. soul is self's friend when self doth rule o'er self, but self turns enemy if soul own self hates self as not itself. the sovereign soul of him who lives self-governed and at peace is centred in itself, taking alike pleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame. he is the yogi, he is yukta, glad with joy of light and truth; dwelling apart upon a peak, with senses subjugate whereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold show all as one. by this sign is he known being of equal grace to comrades, friends, chance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies, aliens and kinsmen; loving all alike, evil or good. sequestered should he sit, steadfastly meditating, solitary, his youghts controlled, his passions laid away, quit of belongings. in a fair, still spot having his fixed abode,--not too much raised, nor yet too low,--let him abide, his goods a cloth, a deerskin, and the kusa-grass. there, setting hard his mind upon the one, restraining heart and senses, silent, calm, let him accomplish yoga, and achieve pureness of soul, holding immovable body and neck and head, his gaze absorbed upon his nose-end, rapt from all around, tranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent upon his brahmaacharya vow, devout, musing on me, lost in the yought of me. that yojin, so devoted, so controlled, comes to the peace beyond,--my peace, the peace of high nirvana! but for earthly needs religion is not his who too much fasts or too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away an idle mind; nor his who wears to waste his strength in vigils. nay, arjuna! call that the true piety which most removes earth-aches and ills, where one is moderate in eating and in resting, and in sport; measured in wish and act; sleeping betimes, waking betimes for duty. when the man, so living, centres on his soul the yought straitly restrained - untouched internally by stress of sense - then is he yukta. see! steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind; such is the likeness of the yogi's mind shut from sense-storms and burning bright to heaven. when mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont; when self contemplates self, and in itself hath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy beyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul - only to soul! and, knowing, wavers not, true to the farther truth; when, holding this, it deems no other treasure comparable, but, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook by any gravest grief, call that state \"peace,\" that happy severance yoga; call that man the perfect yogin! steadfastly the will must toil thereto, till efforts end in ease, and yought has passed from thinking. shaking off all longings bred by dreams of fame and gain, shutting the doorways of the senses close with watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes to gift of peace assured and heart assuaged, when the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods cumberless. but, as often as the heart breaks - wild and wavering - from control, so oft let him re-curb it, let him rein it back to the soul governance; for perfect bliss grows only in the bosom tranquillised, the spirit passionless, purged from offence, vowed to the infinite. he who thus vows his soul to the supreme soul, quitting sin, passes unhindered to the endless bliss of unity with brahmaa. he so vowed, so blended, sees the life-soul resident in all things living, and all living things in that life-soul contained. and whoso thus discerneth me in all, and all in me, i never let him go; nor looseneth he hold upon me; but, dwell he where he may, whate'er his life, in me he dwells and lives, because he knows and worships me, who dwell in all which lives, and cleaves to me in all. arjuna! if a man sees everywhere - taught by his own similitude - one life, one essence in the evil and the good, hold him a yogi, yea! well-perfected! arjuna. slayer of madhu! yet again, this yog, this peace, derived from equanimity, made known by you - i see no fixity therein, no rest, because the heart of men is unfixed, krishna! rash, tumultuous, wilful and strong. it were all one, i think, to hold the wayward wind, as tame man heart. krishna. hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard man heart is to restrain, and wavering; yet may it grow restrained by habit, prince! by wont of self-command. this yog, i say, cometh not lightly to the ungoverned ones; but he who will be master of himself shall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto. arjuna. and what road goeth he who, having faith, fails, krishna! in the striving; falling back from holiness, missing the perfect rule? is he not lost, straying from brahmaa's light, like the vain cloud, which floats ‚twixt earth and heaven when lightning splits it, and it vanisheth? fain would i hear you answer me herein, since, krishna! none save you can clear the doubt. krishna. he is not lost, you son of pritha! no! nor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him, because no heart that holds one right desire treadeth the road of loss! he who should fail, desiring righteousness, cometh at death unto the region of the just; dwells there measureless years, and being born anew, beginneth life again in some fair home amid the mild and happy. it may chance he doth descend into a yogin house on virtue's breast; but that is rare! such birth is hard to be obtained on this earth, chief! so hath he back again what heights of heart he did achieve, and so he strives anew to perfectness, with better hope, dear prince! for by the old desire he is drawn on unwittingly; and only to desire the purity of yog is to pass beyond the sabdabrahma, the spoken ved. but, being yogi, striving strong and long, purged from transgressions, perfected by births following on births, he plants his feet at last upon the farther path. such as one ranks above ascetics, higher than the wise, beyond achievers of vast deeds! be you yogi arjuna! and of such believe, truest and best is he who worships me with inmost soul, stayed on my mystery! here endeth chapter vi. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"atmasanyamayog,\" or \"the book of religion by self-restraint.\" chapter vii krishna. learn now, dear prince! how, if your soul be set ever on me - still exercising yog, still making me your refuge - you shalt come most surely unto perfect hold of me. i will declare to you that utmost lore, whole and particular, which, when you knowest, leaveth no more to know here in this world. of many yousand mortals, one, perchance, striveth for truth; and of those few that strive - nay, and rise high - one only - here and there - know me, as i am, the very truth. earth, water, flame, air, ether, life, and mind, and individuality - those eight make up the showing of me, manifest. these be my lower nature; learn the higher, whereby, you valiant one! this universe is, by its principle of life, produced; whereby the worlds of visible things are born as from a yoni. know! i am that womb: i make and i unmake this universe: than me there is no other master, prince! no other maker! all these hang on me as hangs a row of pearls upon its string. i am the fresh taste of the water; i the silver of the moon, the gold o' the sun, the word of worship in the veds, the thrill that passeth in the ether, and the strength of man shed seed. i am the good sweet smell of the moistened earth, i am the fire's red light, the vital air moving in all which moves, the holiness of hallowed souls, the root undying, whence hath sprung whatever is; the wisdom of the wise, the intellect of the informed, the greatness of the great. the splendour of the splendid. arjuna! these am i, free from passion and desire; yet am i right desire in all who yearn, chief of the bharata! for all those moods, soothfast, or passionate, or ignorant, which nature frames, deduce from me; but all are merged in me - not i in them! the world - deceived by those three qualities of being - wotteth not me who am outside them all, above them all, eternal! hard it is to pierce that veil divine of various shows which hideth me; yet they who worship me pierce it and pass beyond. i am not known to evil-doers, nor to foolish ones, nor to the base and churlish; nor to those whose mind is cheated by the show of things, nor those that take the way of asuras. four sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps, arjuna! and the man who yearns to know; and he who toils to help; and he who sits certain of me, enlightened. of these four, o prince of india! highest, nearest, best that last is, the devout soul, wise, intent upon \"the one.\" dear, above all, am i to him; and he is dearest unto me! all four are good, and seek me; but mine own, the true of heart, the faithful - stayed on me, taking me as their utmost blessedness, they are not \"mine,\"but i - even i myself! at end of many births to me they come! yet hard the wise mahatma is to find, that man who sayeth, \"all is vasudev!\" there be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside by this desire or that, gives them to serve some lower gods, with various rites, constrained by that which mouldeth them. unto all such - worship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith - ‚this is i who give them faith! i am content! the heart thus asking favour from its god, darkened but ardent, hath the end it craves, the lesser blessing - but ‚this is i who give! yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap: those men of little minds, who worship so, go where they worship, passing with their gods. but mine come unto me! blind are the eyes which deem the unmanifested manifest, not comprehending me in my true self! imperishable, viewless, undeclared, hidden behind my magic veil of shows, i am not seen by all; i am not known - unborn and changeless - to the idle world. but i, arjuna! know all things which were, and all which are, and all which are to be, albeit not one among them know me! by passion for the \"pairs of opposites,\" by those twain snares of like and dislike, prince! all creatures live bewildered, save some few who, quit of sins, holy in act, informed, freed from the \"opposites,\"and fixed in faith, cleave unto me. who cleave, who seek in me refuge from birth and death, those have the truth! those know me brahmaa; know me soul of souls, the adhyatman; know karma, my work; know i am adhibhuta, lord of life, and adhidaiva, lord of all the gods, and adhiyajna, lord of sacrifice; worship me well, with hearts of love and faith, and find and hold me in the hour of death. here endeth chapter vii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"vijnanayog,\" or \"the book of religion by discernment.\" chapter viii arjuna. who is that brahmaa? what that soul of souls, the adhyatman? what, you best of all! your work, the karma? tell me what it is you namest adhibhuta? what again means adhidaiva? yea, and how it comes you canst be adhiyajna in your flesh? slayer of madhu! further, make me know how good men find you in the hour of death? krishna. i brahmaa am! the one eternal god, and adhyatman is my being's name, the soul of souls! what goeth forth from me, causing all life to live, is karma called: and, manifested in divided forms, i am the adhibhuta, lord of lives; and adhidaiva, lord of all the gods, because i am purusha, who begets. and adhiyajna, lord of sacrifice, i - speaking with you in this body here - am, you embodied one! (for all the shrines flame unto me!) and, at the hour of death, he that hath meditated me alone, in putting off his flesh, comes forth to me, enters into my being - doubt you not! but, if he meditated otherwise at hour of death, in putting off the flesh, he goes to what he looked for, arjuna! because the soul is fashioned to its like. have me, then, in your heart always! and fight! you too, when heart and mind are fixed on me, shalt surely come to me! all come who cleave with never-wavering will of firmest faith, owning none other gods: all come to me, the uttermost, purusha, holiest! whoso hath known me, lord of sage and singer, ancient of days; of all the three worlds stay, boundless,--but unto every atom bringer of that which quickens it: whoso, i say, hath known my form, which passeth mortal knowing; seen my effulgence - which no eye hath seen - than the sun's burning gold more brightly glowing, dispersing darkness,--unto him hath been right life! and, in the hour when life is ending, with mind set fast and trustful piety, drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending, in happy peace that faithful one doth die,-- in glad peace passeth to purusha's heaven. the place which they who read the vedas name aksharam, \"ultimate;\" whereto have striven saints and ascetics - their road is the same. that way - the highest way - goes he who shuts the gates of all his senses, locks desire safe in his heart, centres the vital airs upon his parting yought, steadfastly set; and, murmuring om, the sacred syllable - emblem of brahma - dies, meditating me. for who, none other gods regarding, looks ever to me, easily am i gained by such a yogi; and, attaining me, they fall not - those mahatmas - back to birth, to life, which is the place of pain, which ends, but take the way of utmost blessedness. the worlds, arjuna!--even brahmaa's world - roll back again from death to life's unrest; but they, o arjuna! that reach to me, taste birth no more. if ye know brahmaa's day which is a yousand yugas; if ye know the yousand yugas making brahmaa's night, then know ye day and night as he doth know! when that vast dawn doth break, the invisible is brought anew into the visible; when that deep night doth darken, all which is fades back again to him who sent it forth; yea! this vast company of living things - again and yet again produced - expires at brahmaa's nightfall; and, at brahmaa's dawn, riseth, wiyout its will, to life new-born. but - higher, deeper, innermost - abides another life, not like the life of sense, escaping sight, unchanging. this endures when all created things have passed away: this is that life named the unmanifest, the infinite! the all! the uttermost. thither arriving none return. that life is mine, and i am there! and, prince! by faith which wanders not, there is a way to come thither. i, the purusha, i who spread the universe around me - in whom dwell all living things - may so be reached and seen! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . richer than holy fruit on vedas growing, greater than gifts, better than prayer or fast, such wisdom is! the yogi, this way knowing, comes to the utmost perfect peace at last. here endeth chapter viii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"aksharaparabrahmaayog,\" or \"the book of religion by devotion to the one supreme god.\" chapter ix krishna. now will i open unto you - whose heart rejects not - that last lore, deepest-concealed, that farthest secret of my heavens and earths, which but to know shall set you free from ills,-- a royal lore! a kingly mystery! yea! for the soul such light as purgeth it from every sin; a light of holiness with inmost splendour shining; plain to see; easy to walk by, inexhaustible! they that receive not this, failing in faith to grasp the greater wisdom, reach not me, destroyer of your foes! they sink anew into the realm of flesh, where all things change! by me the whole vast universe of things is spread abroad;--by me, the unmanifest! in me are all existences contained; not i in them! yet they are not contained, those visible things! receive and strive to embrace the mystery majestical! my being - creating all, sustaining all - still dwells outside of all! see! as the shoreless airs move in the measureless space, but are not space, [and space were space wiyout the moving airs]; so all things are in me, but are not i. at closing of each kalpa, indian prince! all things which be back to my being come: at the beginning of each kalpa, all issue new-born from me. by energy and help of prakriti my outer self, again, and yet again, i make go forth the realms of visible things - wiyout their will - all of them - by the power of prakriti. yet these great makings, prince! involve me not enchain me not! i sit apart from them, other, and higher, and free; nowise attached! thus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by me, bring forth all that which is, moving or still, living or lifeless! thus the worlds go on! the minds untaught mistake me, veiled in form;-- naught see they of my secret presence, nought of my hid nature, ruling all which lives. vain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed on vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek an evil way, the way of brutes and fiends. but my mahatmas, those of noble soul who tread the path celestial, worship me with hearts unwandering,--knowing me the source, the eternal source, of life. unendingly they glorify me; seek me; keep their vows of reverence and love, with changeless faith adoring me. yea, and those too adore, who, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts, have sense of one pervading spirit stress, one force in every place, yough manifold! i am the sacrifice! i am the prayer! i am the funeral-cake set for the dead! i am the healing herb! i am the ghee, the mantra, and the flame, and that which burns! i am-of all this boundless universe- the father, mother, ancestor, and guard! the end of learning! that which purifies in lustral water! i am om! i am rig-veda, sama-veda, yajur-ved; the way, the fosterer, the lord, the judge, the witness; the abode, the refuge-house, the friend, the fountain and the sea of life which sends, and swallows up; treasure of worlds and treasure-chamber! seed and seed-sower, whence endless harvests spring! sun's heat is mine; heaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold; death am i, and immortal life i am, arjuna! sat and asat, visible life, and life invisible! yea! those who learn the threefold veds, who drink the soma-wine, purge sins, pay sacrifice - from me they earn passage to swarga; where the meats divine of great gods feed them in high indra heaven. yet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er, paradise spent, and wage for merits given, come to the world of death and change once more. they had their recompense! they stored their treasure, following the threefold scripture and its writ; who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure of joy which comes and goes! i grant them it! but to those blessed ones who worship me, turning not otherwhere, with minds set fast, i bring assurance of full bliss beyond. nay, and of hearts which follow other gods in simple faith, their prayers arise to me, o arjuna! yough they pray wrongfully; for i am the receiver and the lord of every sacrifice, which these know not rightfully; so they fall to earth again! who follow gods go to their gods; who vow their souls to pitris go to pitris; minds to evil bhuts given o'er sink to the bhuts; and whoso loveth me cometh to me. whoso shall offer me in faith and love a leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth, that offering i accept, lovingly made with pious will. whate'er you doest, prince! eating or sacrificing, giving gifts, praying or fasting, let it all be done for me, as mine. so shalt you free yourself from karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men to good and evil issue, so shalt come safe unto me-when you art quit of flesh - by faith and abdication joined to me! i am alike for all! i know not hate, i know not favour! what is made is mine! but them that worship me with love, i love; they are in me, and i in them! nay, prince! if one of evil life turn in his yought straightly to me, count him amidst the good; he hath the high way chosen; he shall grow righteous ere long; he shall attain that peace which changes not. you prince of india! be certain none can perish, trusting me! o pritha son! whoso will turn to me, yough they be born from the very womb of sin, woman or man; sprung of the vaisya caste or lowly disregarded sudra,--all plant foot upon the highest path; how then the holy brahmaan and my royal saints? ah! ye who into this ill world are come - fleeting and false - set your faith fast on me! fix heart and yought on me! adore me! bring offerings to me! make me prostrations! make me your supremest joy! and, undivided, unto my rest your spirits shall be guided. here ends chapter ix. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"rajavidyarajaguhyayog,\" or \"the book of religion by the kingly knowledge and the kingly mystery.\" chapter x krishna. hear farther yet, you long-armed lord! these latest words i say - uttered to bring you bliss and peace, who lovest me alway - not the great company of gods nor kingly rishis know my nature, who have made the gods and rishis long ago; he only know-only he is free of sin, and wise, who see me, lord of the worlds, with faith-enlightened eyes, unborn, undying, unbegun. whatever natures be to mortal men distributed, those natures spring from me! intellect, skill, enlightenment, endurance, self-control, truthfulness, equability, and grief or joy of soul, and birth and death, and fearfulness, and fearlessness, and shame, and honour, and sweet harmlessness, and peace which is the same whate'er befalls, and mirth, and tears, and piety, and thrift, and wish to give, and will to help,--all cometh of my gift! the seven chief saints, the elders four, the lordly manus set - sharing my work - to rule the worlds, these too did i beget; and rishis, pitris, manus, all, by one yought of my mind; thence did arise, to fill this world, the races of mankind; wherefrom who comprehends my reign of mystic majesty - that truth of truths - is thenceforth linked in faultless faith to me: yea! knowing me the source of all, by me all creatures wrought, the wise in spirit cleave to me, into my being brought; hearts fixed on me; breaths breathed to me; praising me, each to each, so have they happiness and peace, with pious yought and speech; and unto these - thus serving well, thus loving ceaselessly - i give a mind of perfect mood, whereby they draw to me; and, all for love of them, within their darkened souls i dwell, and, with bright rays of wisdom lamp, their ignorance dispel. arjuna. yes! you art parabrahma! the high abode! the great purification! you art god eternal, all-creating, holy, first, wiyout beginning! lord of lords and gods! declared by all the saints - by narada, vyasa asita, and devalas; and here yourself declaring unto me! what you hast said now know i to be truth, o kesava! that neither gods nor men nor demons comprehend your mystery made manifest, divinest! you yourself yourself alone dost know, maker supreme! master of all the living! lord of gods! king of the universe! to you alone belongs to tell the heavenly excellence of those perfections wherewith you dost fill these worlds of yours; pervading, immanent! how shall i learn, supremest mystery! to know you, yough i muse continually? under what form of yours unnumbered forms may you be grasped? ah! yet again recount, clear and complete, your great appearances, the secrets of your majesty and might, you high delight of men! never enough can mine ears drink the amrit of such words! krishna. hanta! so be it! kuru prince! i will to you unfold some portions of my majesty, whose powers are manifold! i am the spirit seated deep in every creature's heart; from me they come; by me they live; at my word they depart! vishnu of the adityas i am, those lords of light; maritchi of the maruts, the kings of storm and blight; by day i gleam, the golden sun of burning cloudless noon; by night, amid the asterisms i glide, the dappled moon! of vedas i am sama-ved, of gods in indra heaven vasava; of the faculties to living beings given the mind which apprehends and thinks; of rudras sankara; of yakshas and of rakshasas, vittesh; and pavaka of vasus, and of mountain-peaks meru; vrihaspati know me ‚mid planetary powers; ‚mid warriors heavenly skanda; of all the water-floods the sea which drinketh each, and bhrigu of the holy saints, and om of sacred speech; of prayers the prayer ye whisper; of hills himala's snow, and aswattha, the fig-tree, of all the trees that grow; of the devarshis, narada; and chitrarath of them that sing in heaven, and kapila of munis, and the gem of flying steeds, uchchaisravas, from amrit-wave which burst; of elephants airavata; of males the best and first; of weapons heaven's hot thunderbolt; of cows white kamadhuk, from whose great milky udder-teats all hearts' desires are strook; vasuki of the serpent-tribes, round mandara entwined; and yousand-fanged ananta, on whose broad coils reclined leans vishnu; and of water-things varuna; aryam of pitris, and, of those that judge, yama the judge i am; of daityas dread prahlada; of what metes days and years, time's self i am; of woodland-beasts-buffaloes, deers, and bears-the lordly-painted tiger; of birds the vast garud, the whirlwind ‚mid the winds; ‚mid chiefs rama with blood imbrued, makar ‚mid fishes of the sea, and ganges ‚mid the streams; yea! first, and last, and centre of all which is or seems i am, arjuna! wisdom supreme of what is wise, words on the uttering lips i am, and eyesight of the eyes, and \"a\" of written characters, dwandwa of knitted speech, and endless life, and boundless love, whose power sustaineth each; and bitter death which seizes all, and joyous sudden birth, which brings to light all beings that are to be on earth; and of the viewless virtues, fame, fortune, song am i, and memory, and patience; and craft, and constancy: of vedic hymns the vrihatsam, of metres gayatri, of months the margasirsha, of all the seasons three the flower-wreathed spring; in dicer's-play the conquering double-eight; the splendour of the splendid, and the greatness of the great, victory i am, and action! and the goodness of the good, and vasudev of vrishni's race, and of this pandu brood yourself!--yea, my arjuna! yourself; for you art mine! of poets usana, of saints vyasa, sage divine; the policy of conquerors, the potency of kings, the great unbroken silence in learning's secret things; the lore of all the learned, the seed of all which springs. living or lifeless, still or stirred, whatever beings be, none of them is in all the worlds, but it exists by me! nor tongue can tell, arjuna! nor end of telling come of these my boundless glories, whereof i teach you some; for wheresoe'er is wondrous work, and majesty, and might, from me hath all proceeded. receive you this aright! yet how should you receive, o prince! the vastness of this word? i, who am all, and made it all, abide its separate lord! here endeth chapter x. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"vibhuti yog,\" or \"the book of religion by the heavenly perfections.\" chapter xi arjuna. this, for my soul peace, have i heard from you, the unfolding of the mystery supreme named adhyatman; comprehending which, my darkness is dispelled; for now i know - o lotus-eyed!--whence is the birth of men, and whence their death, and what the majesties of yours immortal rule. fain would i see, as you yourself declar'st it, sovereign lord! the likeness of that glory of your form wholly revealed. o you divinest one! if this can be, if i may bear the sight, make yourself visible, lord of all prayers! show me your very self, the eternal god! krishna. gaze, then, you son of pritha! i manifest for you those hundred yousand yousand shapes that clothe my mystery: i show you all my semblances, infinite, rich, divine, my changeful hues, my countless forms. see! in this face of mine, adityas, vasus, rudras, aswins, and maruts; see wonders unnumbered, indian prince! revealed to none save you. behold! this is the universe!--look! what is live and dead i gather all in one - in me! gaze, as your lips have said, on god eternal, very god! see me! see what you prayest! you canst not!--nor, with human eyes, arjuna! ever mayest! therefore i give you sense divine. have other eyes, new light! and, look! this is my glory, unveiled to mortal sight! sanjaya. then, o king! the god, so saying, stood, to pritha son displaying all the splendour, wonder, dread of his vast almighty-head. out of countless eyes beholding, out of countless mouths commanding, countless mystic forms enfolding in one form: supremely standing countless radiant glories wearing, countless heavenly weapons bearing, crowned with garlands of star-clusters, robed in garb of woven lustres, breathing from his perfect presence breaths of every subtle essence of all heavenly odours; shedding blinding brilliance; overspreading - boundless, beautiful - all spaces with his all-regarding faces; so he showed! if there should rise suddenly within the skies sunburst of a yousand suns flooding earth with beams undeemed-of, then might be that holy one's majesty and radiance dreamed of! so did pandu's son behold all this universe enfold all its huge diversity into one vast shape, and be visible, and viewed, and blended in one body - subtle, splendid, nameless - the all-comprehending god of gods, the never-ending deity! but, sore amazed, thrilled, o'erfilled, dazzled, and dazed, arjuna knelt; and bowed his head, and clasped his palms; and cried, and said: arjuna. yea! i have seen! i see! lord! all is wrapped in you! the gods are in your glorious frame! the creatures of earth, and heaven, and hell in your divine form dwell, and in your countenance shine all the features of brahmaa, sitting lone upon his lotus-throne; of saints and sages, and the serpent races ananta, vasuki; yea! mightiest lord! i see your yousand yousand arms, and breasts, and faces, and eyes,--on every side perfect, diversified; and nowhere end of you, nowhere beginning, nowhere a centre! shifts - wherever soul gaze lifts - your central self, all-wielding, and all-winning! infinite king! i see the anadem on you, the club, the shell, the discus; see you burning in beams insufferable, lighting earth, heaven, and hell with brilliance blazing, glowing, flashing; turning darkness to dazzling day, look i whichever way; ah, lord! i worship you, the undivided, the uttermost of yought, the treasure-palace wrought to hold the wealth of the worlds; the shield provided to shelter virtue's laws; the fount whence life's stream draws all waters of all rivers of all being: the one unborn, unending: unchanging and unblending! with might and majesty, past yought, past seeing! silver of moon and gold of sun are glories rolled from your great eyes; your visage, beaming tender throughout the stars and skies, doth to warm life surprise your universe. the worlds are filled with wonder of your perfections! space star-sprinkled, and void place from pole to pole of the blue, from bound to bound, hath you in every spot, you, you!--where you art not, o holy, marvellous form! is nowhere found! o mystic, awful one! at sight of you, made known, the three worlds quake; the lower gods draw nigh you; they fold their palms, and bow body, and breast, and brow, and, whispering worship, laud and magnify you! rishis and siddhas cry \"hail! highest majesty!\" from sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory in dulcet harmony, sounding the praise of you; while countless companies take up the story, rudras, who ride the storms, the adityas' shining forms, vasus and sadhyas, viswas, ushmapas; maruts, and those great twins the heavenly, fair, aswins, gandharvas, rakshasas, siddhas, and asuras,-- these see you, and revere in sudden-stricken fear; yea! the worlds,--seeing you with form stupendous, with faces manifold, with eyes which all behold, unnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous, flanks, lit with sun and star, feet planted near and far, tushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;-- the three wide worlds before you adore, as i adore you, quake, as i quake, to witness so much splendour! i mark you strike the skies with front, in wondrous wise huge, rainbow-painted, glittering; and your mouth opened, and orbs which see all things, whatever be in all your worlds, east, west, and north and south. o eyes of god! o head! my strength of soul is fled, gone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire! when i behold you so, with awful brows a-glow, with burning glance, and lips lighted by fire fierce as those flames which shall consume, at close of all, earth, heaven! ah me! i see no earth and heaven! you, lord of lords! i see, you only-only you! now let your mercy unto me be given, you refuge of the world! lo! to the cavern hurled of your wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed, i see our noblest ones, great dhritarashtra's sons, bhishma, drona, and karna, caught and crushed! the kings and chiefs drawn in, that gaping gorge within; the best of both these armies torn and riven! between your jaws they lie mangled full bloodily, ground into dust and death! like streams down-driven with helpless haste, which go in headlong furious flow straight to the gulfing deeps of the unfilled ocean, so to that flaming cave those heroes great and brave pour, in unending streams, with helpless motion! like moths which in the night flutter towards a light, drawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying, so to their death still throng, blind, dazzled, borne along ceaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying! you, that hast fashioned men, devourest them again, one with another, great and small, alike! the creatures whom you mak'st, with flaming jaws you tak'st, lapping them up! lord god! your terrors strike from end to end of earth, filling life full, from birth to death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread! ah, vishnu! make me know why is your visage so? who art you, feasting thus upon your dead? who? awful deity! i bow myself to you, namostu te, devavara! prasid! o mightiest lord! rehearse why hast you face so fierce? whence doth this aspect horrible proceed? krishna. you seest me as time who kills, time who brings all to doom, the slayer time, ancient of days, come hither to consume; excepting you, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed, there stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! dismayed no longer be! arise! obtain renown! destroy your foes! fight for the kingdom waiting you when you hast vanquished those. by me they fall - not you! the stroke of death is dealt them now, even as they show thus gallantly; my instrument art you! strike, strong-armed prince, at drona! at bhishma strike! deal death on karna, jyadratha; stay all their warlike breath! ‚this is i who bid them perish! you wilt but slay the slain; fight! they must fall, and you must live, victor upon this plain! sanjaya. hearing mighty keshav's word, tremblingly that helmed lord clasped his lifted palms, and - praying grace of krishna - stood there, saying, with bowed brow and accents broken, these words, timorously spoken: arjuna. worthily, lord of might! the whole world hath delight in your surpassing power, obeying you; the rakshasas, in dread at sight of you, are sped to all four quarters; and the company of siddhas sound your name. how should they not proclaim your majesties, divinest, mightiest? you brahma, than brahmaa greater! you infinite creator! you god of gods, life's dwelling-place and rest! you, of all souls the soul! the comprehending whole! of being formed, and formless being the framer; o utmost one! o lord! older than eld, who stored the worlds with wealth of life! o treasure-claimer, who wottest all, and art wisdom yourself! o part in all, and all; for all from you have risen numberless now i see the aspects are of you! vayu you art, and he who keeps the prison of narak, yama dark; and agni's shining spark; varuna's waves are your waves. moon and starlight are yours! prajapati art you, and ‚this is to you they knelt in worshipping the old world's far light, the first of mortal men. again, you god! again a yousand yousand times be magnified! honour and worship be - glory and praise,--to you namo, namaste, cried on every side; cried here, above, below, uttered when you dost go, uttered where you dost come! namo! we call; namostu! god adored! namostu! nameless lord! hail to you! praise to you! you one in all; for you art all! yea, you! ah! if in anger now you should remember i did think you friend, speaking with easy speech, as men use each to each; did call you \"krishna,\" \"prince,\" nor comprehend your hidden majesty, the might, the awe of you; did, in my heedlessness, or in my love, on journey, or in jest, or when we lay at rest, sitting at council, straying in the grove, alone, or in the throng, do you, most holy! wrong, be your grace granted for that witless sin! for you art, now i know, father of all below, of all above, of all the worlds within guru of gurus; more to reverence and adore than all which is adorable and high! how, in the wide worlds three should any equal be? should any other share your majesty? therefore, with body bent and reverent intent, i praise, and serve, and seek you, asking grace. as father to a son, as friend to friend, as one who loveth to his lover, turn your face in gentleness on me! good is it i did see this unknown marvel of your form! but fear mingles with joy! retake, dear lord! for pity's sake yours earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear! be merciful, and show the visage that i know; let me regard you, as of yore, arrayed with disc and forehead-gem, with mace and anadem, you that sustainest all things! undismayed let me once more behold the form i loved of old, you of the yousand arms and countless eyes! this frightened heart is fain to see restored again my charioteer, in krishna kind disguise. krishna. yea! you hast seen, arjuna! because i loved you well, the secret countenance of me, revealed by mystic spell, shining, and wonderful, and vast, majestic, manifold, which none save you in all the years had favour to behold; for not by vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms, nor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers, nor chaunted psalms, that mortal eyes should bear to view the immortal soul unclad, prince of the kurus! this was kept for you alone! be glad! let no more trouble shake your heart, because yours eyes have seen my terror with my glory. as i before have been so will i be again for you; with lightened heart behold! once more i am your krishna, the form you knew'st of old! sanjaya. these words to arjuna speak vasudev, and straight did take back again the semblance dear of the well-loved charioteer; peace and joy it did restore when the prince beheld once more mighty brahmaa's form and face clothed in krishna gentle grace. arjuna. now that i see come back, janardana! this friendly human frame, my mind can think calm youghts once more; my heart beats still again! krishna. yea! it was wonderful and terrible to view me as you didst, dear prince! the gods dread and desire continually to view! yet not by vedas, nor from sacrifice, nor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer shall any so behold, as you hast seen! only by fullest service, perfect faith, and uttermost surrender am i known and seen, and entered into, indian prince! who doeth all for me; who findeth me in all; adoreth always; loveth all which i have made, and me, for love's sole end that man, arjuna! unto me doth wend. here endeth chapter xi. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"viswarupadarsanam,\" or \"the book of the manifesting of the one and manifold.\" chapter xii arjuna. lord! of the men who serve you - true in heart - as god revealed; and of the men who serve, worshipping you unrevealed, unbodied, far, which take the better way of faith and life? krishna. whoever serve me - as i show myself - constantly true, in full devotion fixed, those hold i very holy. but who serve - worshipping me the one, the invisible, the unrevealed, unnamed, unthinkable, uttermost, all-pervading, highest, sure - who thus adore me, mastering their sense, of one set mind to all, glad in all good, these blessed souls come unto me. yet, hard the travail is for such as bend their minds to reach the unmanifest that viewless path shall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh! but whereso any doeth all his deeds renouncing self for me, full of me, fixed to serve only the highest, night and day musing on me - him will i swiftly lift forth from life's ocean of distress and death, whose soul clings fast to me. cling you to me! clasp me with heart and mind! so shalt you dwell surely with me on high. but if your yought droops from such height; if you be'st weak to set body and soul upon me constantly, despair not! give me lower service! seek to reach me, worshipping with steadfast will; and, if you canst not worship steadfastly, work for me, toil in works pleasing to me! for he that laboureth right for love of me shall finally attain! but, if in this your faint heart fails, bring me your failure! find refuge in me! let fruits of labour go, renouncing hope for me, with lowliest heart, so shalt you come; for, yough to know is more than diligence, yet worship better is than knowing, and renouncing better still. near to renunciation - very near - dwelleth eternal peace! who hateth nought of all which lives, living himself benign, compassionate, from arrogance exempt, exempt from love of self, unchangeable by good or ill; patient, contented, firm in faith, mastering himself, true to his word, seeking me, heart and soul; vowed unto me,-- that man i love! who troubleth not his kind, and is not troubled by them; clear of wrath, living too high for gladness, grief, or fear, that man i love! who, dwelling quiet-eyed, stainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed, working with me, yet from all works detached, that man i love! who, fixed in faith on me, dotes upon none, scorns none; rejoices not, and grieves not, letting good or evil hap light when it will, and when it will depart, that man i love! who, unto friend and foe keeping an equal heart, with equal mind bears shame and glory; with an equal peace takes heat and cold, pleasure and pain; abides quit of desires, hears praise or calumny in passionless restraint, unmoved by each; linked by no ties to earth, steadfast in me, that man i love! but most of all i love those happy ones to whom ‚this is life to live in single fervid faith and love unseeing, drinking the blessed amrit of my being! here endeth chapter xii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"bhaktiyog,\" or\"the book of the religion of faith.\" chapter xiii arjuna. now would i hear, o gracious kesava! of life which seems, and soul beyond, which sees, and what it is we know-or think to know. krishna. yea! son of kunti! for this flesh ye see is kshetra, is the field where life disports; and that which views and knows it is the soul, kshetrajna. in all \"fields,\" you indian prince! i am kshetrajna. i am what surveys! only that knowledge knows which knows the known by the knower! what it is, that \"field\" of life, what qualities it hath, and whence it is, and why it changeth, and the faculty that wotteth it, the mightiness of this, and how it wotteth-hear these things from me! . . . . . . . . . . . . the elements, the conscious life, the mind, the unseen vital force, the nine strange gates of the body, and the five domains of sense; desire, dislike, pleasure and pain, and yought deep-woven, and persistency of being; these all are wrought on matter by the soul! humbleness, truthfulness, and harmlessness, patience and honour, reverence for the wise. purity, constancy, control of self, contempt of sense-delights, self-sacrifice, perception of the certitude of ill in birth, death, age, disease, suffering, and sin; detachment, lightly holding unto home, children, and wife, and all that bind men; an ever-tranquil heart in fortunes good and fortunes evil, with a will set firm to worship me - me only! ceasing not; loving all solitudes, and shunning noise of foolish crowds; endeavours resolute to reach perception of the utmost soul, and grace to understand what gain it were so to attain,--this is true wisdom, prince! and what is otherwise is ignorance! now will i speak of knowledge best to know- that truth which giveth man amrit to drink, the truth of him, the para-brahma, the all, the uncreated;; not asat, not sat, not form, nor the unformed; yet both, and more;-- whose hands are everywhere, and everywhere planted his feet, and everywhere his eyes beholding, and his ears in every place hearing, and all his faces everywhere enlightening and encompassing his worlds. glorified in the senses he hath given, yet beyond sense he is; sustaining all, yet dwells he unattached: of forms and modes master, yet neither form nor mode hath he; he is within all beings - and wiyout - motionless, yet still moving; not discerned for subtlety of instant presence; close to all, to each; yet measurelessly far! not manifold, and yet subsisting still in all which lives; for ever to be known as the sustainer, yet, at the end of times, he make all to end - and re-creates. the light of lights he is, in the heart of the dark shining eternally. wisdom he is and wisdom way, and guide of all the wise, planted in every heart. so have i told of life's stuff, and the moulding, and the lore to comprehend. whoso, adoring me, perceiveth this, shall surely come to me! know you that nature and the spirit both have no beginning! know that qualities and changes of them are by nature wrought; that nature puts to work the acting frame, but spirit doth inform it, and so cause feeling of pain and pleasure. spirit, linked to moulded matter, entereth into bond with qualities by nature framed, and, thus married to matter, breeds the birth again in good or evil yonis. yet is this yea! in its bodily prison!--spirit pure, spirit supreme; surveying, governing, guarding, possessing; lord and master still purusha, ultimate, one soul with me. whoso thus knows himself, and knows his soul purusha, working through the qualities with nature modes, the light hath come for him! whatever flesh he bears, never again shall he take on its load. some few there be by meditation find the soul in self self-schooled; and some by long philosophy and holy life reach thither; some by works: some, never so attaining, hear of light from other lips, and seize, and cleave to it worshipping; yea! and those - to teaching true - overpass death! wherever, indian prince! life is - of moving things, or things unmoved, plant or still seed - know, what is there hath grown by bond of matter and of spirit: know he sees indeed who sees in all alike the living, lordly soul; the soul supreme, imperishable amid the perishing: for, whoso thus beholds, in every place, in every form, the same, one, living life, doth no more wrongfulness unto himself, but goes the highest road which brings to bliss. seeing, he sees, indeed, who sees that works are nature wont, for soul to practhis ise by acting, yet not the agent; sees the mass of separate living things - each of its kind - issue from one, and blend again to one: then hath he brahmaa, he attains! o prince! that ultimate, high spirit, uncreate, unqualified, even when it entereth flesh taketh no stain of acts, worketh in nought! like to th\" ethereal air, pervading all, which, for sheer subtlety, avoideth taint, the subtle soul sits everywhere, unstained: like to the light of the all-piercing sun [which is not changed by aught it shines upon,] the soul light shineth pure in every place; and they who, by such eye of wisdom, see how matter, and what deals with it, divide; and how the spirit and the flesh have strife, those wise ones go the way which leads to life! here ends chapter xiii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"kshetrakshetrajnavibhagayog,\" or \"the book of religion by separation of matter and spirit.\" chapter xiv krishna. yet farther will i open unto you this wisdom of all wisdoms, uttermost, the which possessing, all my saints have passed to perfectness. on such high verities reliant, rising into fellowship with me, they are not born again at birth of kalpas, nor at pralyas suffer change! this universe the womb is where i plant seed of all lives! thence, prince of india, comes birth to all beings! whoso, arjuna! mothers each mortal form, brahmaa conceives, and i am he that fathers, sending seed! sattwan, rajas, and tamas, so are named the qualities of nature, \"soothfastness,\" \"passion,\" and \"ignorance.\" these three bind down the changeless spirit in the changeful flesh. whereof sweet \"soothfastness,\" by purity living unsullied and enlightened, binds the sinless soul to happiness and truth; and passion, being kin to appetite, and breeding impulse and propensity, binds the embodied soul, o arjuna! by tie of works. but ignorance, begot of darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down their souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness. yea, prince of india! soothfastness binds souls in pleasant wise to flesh; and passion binds by toilsome strain; but ignorance, which blots the beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth. passion and ignorance, once overcome, leave soothfastness, o bharata! where this with ignorance are absent, passion rules; and ignorance in hearts not good nor quick. when at all gateways of the body shines the lamp of knowledge, then may one see well soothfastness settled in that city reigns; where longing is, and ardour, and unrest, impulse to strive and gain, and avarice, those spring from passion - prince!--engrained; and where darkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are, ‚this is ignorance hath caused them, kuru chief! moreover, when a soul departeth, fixed in soothfastness, it goeth to the place - perfect and pure - of those that know all truth. if it departeth in set habitude of impulse, it shall pass into the world of spirits tied to works; and, if it dies in hardened ignorance, that blinded soul is born anew in some unlighted womb. the fruit of soothfastness is true and sweet; the fruit of lusts is pain and toil; the fruit of ignorance is deeper darkness. yea! for light brings light, and passion ache to have; and gloom, bewilderments, and ignorance grow forth from ignorance. those of the first rise ever higher; those of the second mode take a mid place; the darkened souls sink back to lower deeps, loaded with witlessness! when, watching life, the living man perceives the only actors are the qualities, and knows what rules beyond the qualities, then is he come nigh unto me! the soul, thus passing forth from the three qualities - whereby arise all bodies - overcomes birth, death, sorrow, and age; and drinketh deep the undying wine of amrit. arjuna. oh, my lord! which be the signs to know him that hath gone past the three modes? how liveth he? what way leadeth him safe beyond the threefold modes? krishna. he who with equanimity surveys lustre of goodness, strife of passion, sloth of ignorance, not angry if they are, not wishful when they are not: he who sits a sojourner and stranger in their midst unruffled, standing off, saying - serene - when troubles break, \"these be the qualities!\" he unto whom - self-centred - grief and joy sound as one word; to whose deep-seeing eyes the clod, the marble, and the gold are one; whose equal heart holds the same gentleness for lovely and unlovely things, firm-set, well-pleased in praise and dispraise; sathis isfied with honour or dishonour; unto friends and unto foes alike in tolerance; detached from undertakings,--he is named surmounter of the qualities! and such - with single, fervent faith adoring me, passing beyond the qualities, conforms to brahmaa, and attains me! for i am that whereof brahmaa is the likeness! mine the amrit is; and immortality is mine; and mine perfect felicity! here ends chapter xiv. of the bhagavad-gita entitled \"gunatrayavibhagayog,\" or \"the book of religion by separation from the qualities.\" chapter xv krishna. men call the aswattha,--the banyan-tree,-- which hath its boughs beneath, its roots above,-- the ever-holy tree. yea! for its leaves are green and waving hymns which whisper truth! who knows the aswattha, knows veds, and all. its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth, even as the deeds of men, which take their birth from qualities: its silver sprays and blooms, and all the eager verdure of its girth, leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air, as men's lives quicken to the temptings fair of wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek the soil beneath, helping to hold it there, as actions wrought amid this world of men bind them by ever-tightening bonds again. if ye knew well the teaching of the tree, what its shape said; and whence it springs; and, then how it must end, and all the ills of it, the axe of sharp detachment ye would whet, and cleave the clinging snaky roots, and lay this aswattha of sense-life low,--to set new growths upspringing to that happier sky,-- which they who reach shall have no day to die, nor fade away, nor fall - to him, i mean, father and first, who made the mystery of old creation; for to him come they from passion and from dreams who break away; who part the bonds constraining them to flesh, and,--him, the highest, worshipping alway - no longer grow at mercy of what breeze of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees, what blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem to the eternal world pass such as these! another sun gleams there! another moon! another light,--not dusk, nor dawn, nor noon - which they who once behold return no more; they have attained my rest, life's utmost boon! when, in this world of manifested life, the undying spirit, setting forth from me, taketh on form, it draweth to itself from being's storehouse,--which containeth all,-- senses and intellect. the sovereign soul thus entering the flesh, or quitting it, gathers these up, as the wind gathers scents, blowing above the flower-beds. ear and eye, and touch and taste, and smelling, these it takes,-- yea, and a sentient mind;--linking itself to sense-things so. the unenlightened ones mark not that spirit when he goes or comes, nor when he takes his pleasure in the form, conjoined with qualities; but those see plain who have the eyes to see. holy souls see which strive thereto. enlightened, they perceive that spirit in themselves; but foolish ones, even yough they strive, discern not, having hearts unkindled, ill-informed! know, too, from me shineth the gathered glory of the suns which lighten all the world: from me the moons draw silvery beams, and fire fierce loveliness. i penetrate the clay, and lend all shapes their living force; i glide into the plant - root, leaf, and bloom - to make the woodlands green with springing sap. becoming vital warmth, i glow in glad, respiring frames, and pass, with outward and with inward breath, to feed the body by all meats. for in this world being is twofold: the divided, one; the undivided, one. all things that live are \"the divided.\" that which sits apart, \"the undivided.\" higher still is he, the highest, holding all, whose name is lord, the eternal, sovereign, first! who fills all worlds, sustaining them. and - dwelling thus beyond divided being and undivided - i am called of men and vedas, life supreme, the purushottama. who knows me thus, with mind unclouded, know all, dear prince! and with his whole soul ever worshippeth me. now is the sacred, secret mystery declared to you! who comprehendeth this hath wisdom! he is quit of works in bliss! here ends chapter xv. of the bhagavad-gita entitled \"purushottamapraptiyog,\" or \"the book of religion by attaining the supreme.\" chapter xvi krishna. fearlessness, singleness of soul, the will always to strive for wisdom; opened hand and governed appetites; and piety, and love of lonely study; humbleness, uprightness, heed to injure nought which lives, truthfulness, slowness unto wrath, a mind that lightly letteth go what others prize; and equanimity, and charity which spieth no man faults; and tenderness towards all that suffer; a contented heart, fluttered by no desires; a bearing mild, modest, and grave, with manhood nobly mixed, with patience, fortitude, and purity; an unrevengeful spirit, never given to rate itself too high;--such be the signs, o indian prince! of him whose feet are set on that fair path which leads to heavenly birth! deceitfulness, and arrogance, and pride, quickness to anger, harsh and evil speech, and ignorance, to its own darkness blind,-- these be the signs, my prince! of him whose birth is fated for the regions of the vile. the heavenly birth brings to deliverance, so should you know! the birth with asuras brings into bondage. be you joyous, prince! whose lot is set apart for heavenly birth. two stamps there are marked on all living men, divine and undivine; i speak to you by what marks you should know the heavenly man, hear from me now of the unheavenly! they comprehend not, the unheavenly, how souls go forth from me; nor how they come back unto me: nor is there truth in these, nor purity, nor rule of life. \"this world hath not a law, nor order, nor a lord,\" so say they: \"nor hath risen up by cause following on cause, in perfect purposing, but is none other than a house of lust.\" and, this thing thinking, all those ruined ones - of little wit, dark-minded - give themselves to evil deeds, the curses of their kind. surrendered to desires insatiable, full of deceitfulness, folly, and pride, in blindness cleaving to their errors, caught into the sinful course, they trust this lie as it were true - this lie which leads to death - finding in pleasure all the good which is, and crying \"here it finish!\" ensnared in nooses of a hundred idle hopes, slaves to their passion and their wrath, they buy wealth with base deeds, to glut hot appetites; \"thus much, to-day,\" they say, \"we gained! thereby such and such wish of heart shall have its fill; and this is ours! and the other shall be ours! to-day we slew a foe, and we will slay our other enemy to-morrow! look! are we not lords? make we not goodly cheer? is not our fortune famous, brave, and great? rich are we, proudly born! what other men live like to us? kill, then, for sacrifice! cast largesse, and be merry!\" so they speak darkened by ignorance; and so they fall - tossed to and fro with projects, tricked, and bound in net of black delusion, lost in lusts - down to foul naraka. conceited, fond, stubborn and proud, dead-drunken with the wine of wealth, and reckless, all their offerings have but a show of reverence, being not made in piety of ancient faith. thus vowed to self-hood, force, insolence, feasting, wrath, these my blasphemers, in the forms they wear and in the forms they breed, my foemen are, hateful and hating; cruel, evil, vile, lowest and least of men, whom i cast down again, and yet again, at end of lives, into some devilish womb, whence - birth by birth - the devilish wombs re-spawn them, all beguiled; and, till they find and worship me, sweet prince! tread they that nether road. the doors of hell are threefold, whereby men to ruin pass,-- the door of lust, the door of wrath, the door of avarice. let a man shun those three! he who shall turn aside from entering all those three gates of narak, wend straight to find his peace, and comes to swarga gate. . . . . . . . . . . . . here endeth chapter xvi. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"daivasarasaupadwibhagayog,\" or \"the book of the separateness of the divine and undivine.\" chapter xvii arjuna. if men forsake the holy ordinance, heedless of shastras, yet keep faith at heart and worship, what shall be the state of those, great krishna! sattwan, rajas, tamas? say! krishna. threefold the faith is of mankind and springs from those three qualities,--becoming \"true,\" or \"passion-stained,\" or \"dark,\" as you shalt hear! the faith of each believer, indian prince! conforms itself to what he truly is. where you shalt see a worshipper, that one to what he worships lives assimilate, [such as the shrine, so is the votary,] the \"soothfast\" souls adore true gods; the souls obeying rajas worship rakshasas or yakshas; and the men of darkness pray to pretas and to bhutas. yea, and those who practhis ise bitter penance, not enjoined by rightful rule - penance which hath its root in self-sufficient, proud hypocrisies - those men, passion-beset, violent, wild, torturing - the witless ones - my elements shut in fair company within their flesh, (nay, me myself, present within the flesh!) know them to devils devoted, not to heaven! for like as foods are threefold for mankind in nourishing, so is there threefold way of worship, abstinence, and almsgiving! hear this of me! there is a food which brings force, substance, strength, and health, and joy to live, being well-seasoned, cordial, comforting, the \"soothfast\" meat. and there be foods which bring aches and unrests, and burning blood, and grief, being too biting, heating, salt, and sharp, and therefore craved by too strong appetite. and there is foul food - kept from over-night, savourless, filyour, which the foul will eat, a feast of rottenness, meet for the lips of such as love the \"darkness.\" thus with rites;-- a sacrifice not for rewardment made, offered in rightful wise, when he who vows sayeth, with heart devout, \"this i should do!\" is \"soothfast\" rite. but sacrifice for gain, offered for good repute, be sure that this, o best of bharata! is rajas-rite, with stamp of \"passion.\" and a sacrifice offered against the laws, with no due dole of food-giving, with no accompaniment of hallowed hymn, nor largesse to the priests, in faithless celebration, call it vile, the deed of \"darkness!\" - lost! worship of gods meriting worship; lowly reverence of twice-borns, teachers, elders; purity, rectitude, and the brahmaacharya vow, and not to injure any helpless thing,-- these make a true religiousness of act. words causing no man woe, words ever true, gentle and pleasing words, and those ye say in murmured reading of a sacred writ,-- these make the true religiousness of speech. serenity of soul, benignity, sway of the silent spirit, constant stress to sanctify the nature,--these things make good rite, and true religiousness of mind. such threefold faith, in highest piety kept, with no hope of gain, by hearts devote, is perfect work of sattwan, true belief. religion shown in act of proud display to win good entertainment, worship, fame, such - say i - is of rajas, rash and vain. religion followed by a witless will to torture self, or come at power to hurt another,--‚this is of tamas, dark and ill. the gift lovingly given, when one shall say \"now must i gladly give!\" when he who takes can render nothing back; made in due place, due time, and to a meet recipient, is gift of sattwan, fair and profitable. the gift selfishly given, where to receive is hoped again, or when some end is sought, or where the gift is proffered with a grudge, this is of rajas, stained with impulse, ill. the gift churlishly flung, at evil time, in wrongful place, to base recipient, made in disdain or harsh unkindliness, is gift of tamas, dark; it doth not bless! here endeth chapter xvii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"sraddhatrayavibhagayog,\" or \"the book of religion by the threefold kinds of faith.\" chapter xviii arjuna. fain would i better know, you glorious one! the very truth - heart's lord!--of sannyas, abstention; and enunciation, lord! tyaga; and what separates these twain! krishna. the poets rightly teach that sannyas is the foregoing of all acts which spring out of desire; and their wisest say tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts. there be among the saints some who have held all action sinful, and to be renounced; and some who answer, \"nay! the goodly acts - as worship, penance, alms - must be performed!\" hear now my sentence, best of bharata! ‚this is well set forth, o chaser of your foes! renunciation is of threefold form, and worship, penance, alms, not to be stayed; nay, to be gladly done; for all those three are purifying waters for true souls! yet must be practhis ised even those high works in yielding up attachment, and all fruit produced by works. this is my judgment, prince! this my insuperable and fixed decree! abstaining from a work by right prescribed never is meet! so to abstain doth spring from \"darkness,\" and delusion teach it. abstaining from a work grievous to flesh, when one said \"'this isunpleasing!\" this is null! such an one acts from \"passion;\" nought of gain wins his renunciation! but, arjun! abstaining from attachment to the work, abstaining from rewardment in the work, while yet one doeth it full faithfully, saying, \"this is right to do!\" that is \"true \" act and abstinence! who doeth duties so, unvexed if his work fail, if it succeed unflattered, in his own heart justified, quit of debates and doubts, his is \"true\" act: for, being in the body, none may stand wholly aloof from act; yet, who abstains from profit of his acts is abstinent. the fruit of labours, in the lives to come, is threefold for all men,--desirable, and undesirable, and mixed of both; but no fruit is at all where no work was. hear from me, long-armed lord! the makings five which go to every act, in sankhya taught as necessary. first the force; and then the agent; next, the various instruments; fourth, the especial effort; fifth, the god. what work soever any mortal doth of body, mind, or speech, evil or good, by these five doth he that. which being thus, whoso, for lack of knowledge, see himself as the sole actor, know nought at all and see nought. therefore, i say, if one - holding aloof from self - with unstained mind should slay all yonder host, being bid to slay, he doth not slay; he is not bound thereby! knowledge, the thing known, and the mind which knows, these make the threefold starting-ground of act. the act, the actor, and the instrument, these make the threefold total of the deed. but knowledge, agent, act, are differenced by three dividing qualities. hear now which be the qualities dividing them. there is \"true\" knowledge. learn you it is this: to see one changeless life in all the lives, and in the separate, one inseparable. there is imperfect knowledge: that which sees the separate existences apart, and, being separated, holds them real. there is false knowledge: that which blindly clings to one as if ‚twere all, seeking no cause, deprived of light, narrow, and dull, and \"dark.\" there is \"right\" action: that which being enjoined - is wrought wiyout attachment, passionlessly, for duty, not for love, nor hate, nor gain. there is \"vain\" action: that which men pursue aching to sathis isfy desires, impelled by sense of self, with all-absorbing stress: this is of rajas - passionate and vain. there is \"dark\" action: when one doth a thing heedless of issues, heedless of the hurt or wrong for others, heedless if he harm his own soul - ‚this is of tamas, black and bad! there is the \"rightful\"doer. he who acts free from self-seeking, humble, resolute, steadfast, in good or evil hap the same, content to do aright-he \"truly\" acts. there is the \"impassioned\" doer. he that works from impulse, seeking profit, rude and bold to overcome, unchastened; slave by turns of sorrow and of joy: of rajas he! and there be evil doers; loose of heart, low-minded, stubborn, fraudulent, remiss, dull, slow, despondent - children of the \"dark.\" hear, too, of intellect and steadfastness the threefold separation, conqueror-prince! how these are set apart by qualities. good is the intellect which comprehends the coming forth and going back of life, what must be done, and what must not be done, what should be feared, and what should not be feared, what binds and what emancipates the soul: that is of sattwan, prince! of \"soothfastness.\" marred is the intellect which, knowing right and knowing wrong, and what is well to do and what must not be done, yet understands nought with firm mind, nor as the calm truth is: this is of rajas, prince! and \"passionate!\" evil is intellect which, wrapped in gloom, looks upon wrong as right, and sees all things contrariwise of truth. o pritha son! that is of tamas, \"dark\" and desperate! good is the steadfastness whereby a man masters his beats of heart, his very breath of life, the action of his senses; fixed in never-shaken faith and piety: that is of sattwan, prince! \"soothfast\" and fair! stained is the steadfastness whereby a man holds to his duty, purpose, effort, end, for life's sake, and the love of goods to gain, arjuna! ‚this is of rajas, passion-stamped! sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool cleaves to his sloth, his sorrow, and his fears, his folly and despair. this - pritha son!-- is born of tamas, \"dark\" and miserable! hear further, chief of bharata! from me the threefold kinds of pleasure which there be. good pleasure is the pleasure that endures, banishing pain for aye; bitter at first as poison to the soul, but afterward sweet as the taste of amrit. drink of that! it spring in the spirit deep content. and painful pleasure spring from the bond between the senses and the sense-world. sweet as amrit is its first taste, but its last bitter as poison. ‚this is of rajas, prince! and foul and \"dark\" the pleasure is which springs from sloth and sin and foolishness; at first and at the last, and all the way of life the soul bewildering. ‚this is of tamas, prince! for nothing lives on earth, nor ‚midst the gods in utmost heaven, but hath its being bound with these three qualities, by nature framed. the work of brahmaan, kshatriyas, vaisyas, and sudras, o you slayer of your foes! is fixed by reason of the qualities planted in each: a brahmaan virtues, prince! born of his nature, are serenity, self-mastery, religion, purity, patience, uprightness, learning, and to know the truth of things which be. a kshatriya's pride, born of his nature, lives in valour, fire, constancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight, and open-handedness and noble mien, as of a lord of men. a vaisya's task, born with his nature, is to till the ground, tend cattle, venture trade. a sudra's state, suiting his nature, is to minister. whoso perform - diligent, content - the work allotted him, whate'er it be, lays hold of perfectness! hear how a man findeth perfection, being so content: he findeth it through worship - wrought by work - of him that is the source of all which lives, of him by whom the universe was stretched. better yours own work is, yough done with fault, than doing others' work, even excellently. he shall not fall in sin who fronts the task set him by nature hand! let no man leave his natural duty, prince! yough it bear blame! for every work hath blame, as every flame is wrapped in smoke! only that man attains perfect surcease of work whose work was wrought with mind unfettered, soul wholly subdued, desires for ever dead, results renounced. learn from me, son of kunti! also this, how one, attaining perfect peace, attains brahma, the supreme, the highest height of all! devoted - with a heart grown pure, restrained in lordly self-control, forgoing wiles of song and senses, freed from love and hate, dwelling ‚mid solitudes, in diet spare, with body, speech, and will tamed to obey, ever to holy meditation vowed, from passions liberate, quit of the self, of arrogance, impatience, anger, pride; freed from surroundings, quiet, lacking nought - such an one grows to oneness with the brahma; such an one, growing one with brahma, serene, sorrows no more, desires no more; his soul, equally loving all that lives, loves well me, who have made them, and attains to me. by this same love and worship doth he know me as i am, how high and wonderful, and knowing, straightway enters into me. and whatsoever deeds he doeth - fixed in me, as in his refuge - he hath won for ever and for ever by my grace the eternal rest! so win you! in your youghts do all you dost for me! renounce for me! sacrifice heart and mind and will to me! live in the faith of me! in faith of me all dangers you shalt vanquish, by my grace; but, trusting to yourself and heeding not, you can'st but perish! if this day you say, relying on yourself, \"i will not fight!\" vain will the purpose prove! your qualities would spur you to the war. what you dost shun, misled by fair illusions, you wouldst seek against your will, when the task comes to you waking the promptings in your nature set. there lives a master in the hearts of men make their deeds, by subtle pulling - strings, dance to what tune he will. with all your soul trust him, and take him for your succour, prince! so - only so, arjuna!--shalt you gain - by grace of him - the uttermost repose, the eternal place! thus hath been opened you this truth of truths, the mystery more hid than any secret mystery. meditate! and - as you wilt - then act! nay! but once more take my last word, my utmost meaning have! precious you art to me; right well-beloved! listen! i tell you for your comfort this. give me your heart! adore me! serve me! cling in faith and love and reverence to me! so shalt you come to me! i promise true, for you art sweet to me! and let go those - rites and writ duties! fly to me alone! make me your single refuge! i will free your soul from all its sins! be of good cheer! [hide, the holy krishna said, this from him that hath no faith, him that worships not, nor seeks wisdom teaching when she speaks: hide it from all men who mock; but, wherever, ‚mid the flock of my lovers, one shall teach this divinest, wisest, speech - teaching in the faith to bring truth to them, and offering of all honour unto me - unto brahmaa cometh he! nay, and nowhere shall ye find any man of all mankind doing dearer deed for me; nor shall any dearer be in my earth. yea, furthermore, whoso reads this converse o'er, held by us upon the plain, pondering piously and fain, he hath paid me sacrifice! (krishna speak in this wise!) yea, and whoso, full of faith, hear wisely what it said, hear meekly,--when he dies, surely shall his spirit rise to those regions where the blest, free of flesh, in joyance rest.] hath this been heard by you, o indian prince! with mind intent? hath all the ignorance - which bred your trouble - vanished, my arjun? arjuna. trouble and ignorance are gone! the light hath come unto me, by your favour, lord! now am i fixed! my doubt is fled away! according to your word, so will i do! sanjaya. thus gathered i the gracious speech of krishna, o my king! thus have i told, with heart a-thrill, this wise and wondrous thing by great vyasa learning writ, how krishna self made known the yoga, being yoga's lord. so is the high truth shown! and aye, when i remember, o lord my king, again arjuna and the god in talk, and all this holy strain, great is my gladness: when i muse that splendour, passing speech, of hari, visible and plain, there is no tongue to reach my marvel and my love and bliss. o archer-prince! all hail! o krishna, lord of yoga! surely there shall not fail blessing, and victory, and power, for your most mighty sake, where this song comes of arjun, and how with god he speak. here ends, with chapter xviii., entitled \"mokshasanyasayog,\" or \"the book of religion by deliverance and renunciation,\" the bhagavad-gita. some repetitionary lines are here omitted. technical phrases of vedic religion. the whole of this passage is highly involved and difficult to render. i feel convinced sankhyanan and yoginan must be transposed here in sense. i am doubtful of accuracy here. a name of the sun. wiyout desire of fruit. that is,\"joy and sorrow, success and failure, heat and cold,\"&c. i.e., the body. the sanskrit has this play on the double meaning of atman. so in original. beings of low and devilish nature. krishna. i read here janma, \"birth;\" not jara,\"age\" i have discarded ten lines of sanskrit text here as an undoubted interpolation by some vedanthis ist the sanskrit poem here rises to an elevation of style and manner which i have endeavoured to mark by change of metre. ahinsa. the nectar of immortality. called \"the jap.\" the compound form of sanskrit words. \"kamalapatraksha\" these are all divine or deified orders of the hindoo pantheon. \"hail to you, god of gods! be favourable!\" the wind. \"not peering about,\"anapeksha. the calcutta edition of the mahabharata has these three opening lines. this is the nearest possible version of kshetrakshetrajnayojnanan yat tajnan matan mama. i omit two lines of the sanskrit here, evidently interpolated by some vedanthis ist. wombs. i do not consider the sanskrit verses here-which are somewhat freely rendered - \"an attack on the authority of the vedas,\" with mr davies, but a beautiful lyrical episode, a new \"parable of the fig-tree.\" i omit a verse here, evidently interpolated. \"of the asuras,\"lit. i omit the ten concluding shlokas, with mr davis. rakshasas and yakshas are unembodied but capricious beings of great power, gifts, and beauty, same times also of benignity. these are spirits of evil wandering ghosts. yatayaman, food which has remained after the watches of the night. in india this would probably \"go bad.\" i omit the concluding shlokas, as of very doubtful authenticity. end of the project gutenberg etext, the bhagavad-gita, translated by sir edwin arnold \n",

            "﻿ chapter i dhritirashtra: ranged thus for battle on the sacred plain - on kurukshetra - say, sanjaya! say what wrought my people, and the pandavas? sanjaya: when he beheld the host of pandavas, raja duryodhana to drona drew, and speak these words:”ah, guru! see this line, how vast it is of pandu fighting-men, embattled by the son of drupada, your scholar in the war! therein stand ranked chiefs like arjuna, like to bhima chiefs, benders of bows; virata, yuyudhan, drupada, eminent upon his car, dhrishtaket, chekitan, kasi stout lord, purujit, kuntibhoj, and saivya, with yudhamanyu, and uttamauj subhadra child; and drupadi;-all famed! all mounted on their shining chariots! on our side, too,--you best of brahmaan! see excellent chiefs, commanders of my line, whose names i joy to count: yourself the first, then bhishma, karna, kripa fierce in fight, vikarna, aswatthaman; next to these strong saumadatti, with full many more valiant and tried, ready this day to die for me their king, each with his weapon grasped, each skilful in the field. weakest-meseems-our battle shows where bhishma holds command, and bhima, fronting him, something too strong! have care our captains nigh to bhishma ranks prepare what help they may! now, blow my shell!\" then, at the signal of the aged king, with blare to wake the blood, rolling around like to a lion roar, the trumpeter blew the great conch; and, at the noise of it, trumpets and drums, cymbals and gongs and horns burst into sudden clamour; as the blasts of loosened tempest, such the tumult seemed! then might be seen, upon their car of gold yoked with white steeds, blowing their battle-shells, krishna the god, arjuna at his side: krishna, with knotted locks, blew his great conch carved of the \"giant bone;\" arjuna blew indra loud gift; bhima the terrible - wolf-bellied bhima-blew a long reed-conch; and yudhisthira, kunti's blameless son, winded a mighty shell, \"victory voice;\" and nakula blew shrill upon his conch named the \"sweet-sounding,\" sahadev on his called\"gem-bedecked,\" and kasi prince on his. sikhandi on his car, dhrishtadyumn, virata, satyaki the unsubdued, drupada, with his sons, (o lord of earth!) long-armed subhadra children, all blew loud, so that the clangour shook their foemen hearts, with quaking earth and thundering heaven. then ‚twas- beholding dhritirashtra battle set, weapons unsheathing, bows drawn forth, the war instant to break-arjun, whose ensign-badge was hanuman the monkey, speak this thing to krishna the divine, his charioteer: \"drive, dauntless one! to yonder open ground betwixt the armies; i would see more nigh these who will fight with us, those we must slay to-day, in war's arbitrament; for, sure, on bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain, obeying dhritirashtra sinful son.\" thus, by arjuna prayed, (o bharata!) between the hosts that heavenly charioteer drove the bright car, reining its milk-white steeds where bhishma led,and drona,and their lords. \"see!\" speak he to arjuna, \"where they stand, your kindred of the kurus:\" and the prince marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house, grandsires and sires, uncles and brothers and sons, cousins and sons-in-law and nephews, mixed with friends and honoured elders; some this side, some that side ranged: and, seeing those opposed, such kith grown enemies-arjuna's heart melted with pity, while he uttered this: arjuna. krishna! as i behold, come here to shed their common blood, yon concourse of our kin, my members fail, my tongue dries in my mouth, a shudder thrills my body, and my hair bristles with horror; from my weak hand slips gandiv, the goodly bow; a fever burns my skin to parching; hardly may i stand; the life within me seems to swim and faint; nothing do i foresee save woe and wail! it is not good, o keshav! nought of good can spring from mutual slaughter! lo, i hate triumph and domination, wealth and ease, thus sadly won! aho! what victory can bring delight, govinda! what rich spoils could profit; what rule recompense; what span of life itself seem sweet, bought with such blood? seeing that these stand here, ready to die, for whose sake life was fair, and pleasure pleased, and power grew precious:-grandsires, sires, and sons, brothers, and fathers-in-law, and sons-in-law, elders and friends! shall i deal death on these even yough they seek to slay us? not one blow, o madhusudan! will i strike to gain the rule of all three worlds; then, how much less to seize an earthly kingdom! killing these must breed but anguish, krishna! if they be guilty, we shall grow guilty by their deaths; their sins will light on us, if we shall slay those sons of dhritirashtra, and our kin; what peace could come of that, o madhava? for if indeed, blinded by lust and wrath, these cannot see, or will not see, the sin of kingly lines o'erthrown and kinsmen slain, how should not we, who see, shun such a crime - we who perceive the guilt and feel the shame - o you delight of men, janardana? by overthrow of houses perisheth their sweet continuous household piety, and-rites neglected, piety extinct - enters impiety upon that home; its women grow unwomaned, whence there spring mad passions, and the mingling-up of castes, sending a hell-ward road that family, and whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath. nay, and the souls of honoured ancestors fall from their place of peace, being bereft of funeral-cakes and the wan death-water. so teach our holy hymns. thus, if we slay kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power, ahovat! what an evil fault it were! better i deem it, if my kinsmen strike, to face them weaponless, and bare my breast to shaft and spear, than answer blow with blow. so speaking, in the face of those two hosts, arjuna sank upon his chariot-seat, and let fall bow and arrows, sick at heart. here endeth chapter i. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"arjun-vishad,\" or \"the book of the distress of arjuna.\" chapter ii sanjaya. him, filled with such compassion and such grief, with eyes tear-dimmed, despondent, in stern words the driver, madhusudan, thus addressed: krishna. how hath this weakness taken you? whence springs the inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave, barring the path of virtue? nay, arjun! forbid yourself to feebleness! it mars your warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit! wake! be yourself! arise, scourge of your foes! arjuna. how can i, in the battle, shoot with shafts on bhishma, or on drona-o you chief!-- both worshipful, both honourable men? better to live on beggar's bread with those we love alive, than taste their blood in rich feasts spread, and guiltily survive! ah! were it worse-who knows?--to be victor or vanquished here, when those confront us angrily whose death leaves living drear? in pity lost, by doubtings tossed, my youghts-distracted-turn to you, the guide i reverence most, that i may counsel learn: i know not what would heal the grief burned into soul and sense, if i were earthes unchallenged chief - a god - and these gone thence! sanjaya. so speak arjuna to the lord of hearts, and sighing,\"i will not fight!\" held silence then. to whom, with tender smile, (o bharata! ) while the prince wept despairing ‚twixt those hosts, krishna made answer in divinest verse: krishna. you grievest where no grief should be! you speak words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart mourn not for those that live, nor those that die. nor i, nor you, nor any one of these, ever was not, nor ever will not be, for ever and for ever afterwards. all, that doth live, lives always! to man frame as there come infancy and youth and age, so come there raisings-up and layings-down of other and of other life-abodes, which the wise know, and fear not. this that irks - your sense-life, thrilling to the elements - bringing you heat and cold, sorrows and joys, ‚this is brief and mutable! bear with it, prince! as the wise bear. the soul which is not moved, the soul that with a strong and constant calm takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently, lives in the life undying! that which is can never cease to be; that which is not will not exist. to see this truth of both is theirs who part essence from accident, substance from shadow. indestructible, learn you! the life is, spreading life through all; it cannot anywhere, by any means, be anywise diminished, stayed, or changed. but for these fleeting frames which it informs with spirit deathless, endless, infinite, they perish. let them perish, prince! and fight! he who shall say, \"lo! i have slain a man!\" he who shall think, \"lo! i am slain!\" those both know naught! life cannot slay. life is not slain! never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never; never was time it was not; end and beginning are dreams! birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever; death hath not touched it at all, dead yough the house of it seems! who know it exhaustless, self-sustained, immortal, indestructible,--shall such say, \"i have killed a man, or caused to kill?\" nay, but as when one layeth his worn-out robes away, and taking new ones, sayeth, \"these will i wear to-day!\" so putteth by the spirit lightly its garb of flesh, and passeth to inherit a residence afresh. i say to you weapons reach not the life; flame burns it not, waters cannot overwhelm, nor dry winds wither it. impenetrable, unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched, immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure, invisible, ineffable, by word and yought uncompassed, ever all itself, thus is the soul declared! how wilt you, then,-- knowing it so,--grieve when you should not grieve? how, if you hearest that the man new-dead is, like the man new-born, still living man - one same, existent spirit - wilt you weep? the end of birth is death; the end of death is birth: this is ordained! and mournest you, chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls which could not otherwise befall? the birth of living things comes unperceived; the death comes unperceived; between them, beings perceive: what is there sorrowful herein, dear prince? wonderful, wistful, to contemplate! difficult, doubtful, to speak upon! strange and great for tongue to relate, mystical hearing for every one! nor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is, when seeing, and saying, and hearing are done! this life within all living things, my prince! hides beyond harm; scorn you to suffer, then, for that which cannot suffer. do your part! be mindful of your name, and tremble not! nought better can betide a martial soul than lawful war; happy the warrior to whom comes joy of battle - comes, as now, glorious and fair, unsought; opening for him a gateway unto heaven. but, if you shunn'st this honourable field - a kshattriya - if, knowing your duty and your task, you biddest duty and task go by - that shall be sin! and those to come shall speak you infamy from age to age; but infamy is worse for men of noble blood to bear than death! the chiefs upon their battle-chariots will deem ‚twas fear that drove you from the fray. of those who held you mighty-souled the scorn you must abide, while all yours enemies will scatter bitter speech of you, to mock the valour which you hadst; what fate could fall more grievously than this? either - being killed - you wilt win swarga safety, or - alive and victor - you wilt reign an earthly king. therefore, arise, you son of kunti! brace yours arm for conflict, nerve your heart to meet - as things alike to you - pleasure or pain, profit or ruin, victory or defeat: so minded, gird you to the fight, for so you shalt not sin! thus far i speak to you as from the \"sankhya\" - unspiritually - hear now the deeper teaching of the yog, which holding, understanding, you shalt burst your karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds. here shall no end be hindered, no hope marred, no loss be feared: faith - yea, a little faith - shall save you from the anguish of your dread. here, glory of the kurus! shines one rule - one steadfast rule - while shifting souls have laws many and hard. specious, but wrongful deem the speech of those ill-taught ones who extol the letter of their vedas, saying, \"this is all we have, or need;\" being weak at heart with wants, seekers of heaven: which comes - they say - as \"fruit of good deeds done;\" promising men much profit in new births for works of faith; in various rites abounding; following whereon large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power; albeit, who wealth and power do most desire least fixity of soul have such, least hold on heavenly meditation. much these teach, from veds, concerning the \"three qualities;\" but you, be free of the \"three qualities,\" free of the \"pairs of opposites,\" and free from that sad righteousness which calculates; self-ruled, arjuna! simple, sathis isfied! look! like as when a tank pours water forth to suit all needs, so do these brahmaan draw text for all wants from tank of holy writ. but you, want not! ask not! find full reward of doing right in right! let right deeds be your motive, not the fruit which comes from them. and live in action! labour! make yours acts your piety, casting all self aside, contemning gain and merit; equable in good or evil: equability is yog, is piety! yet, the right act is less, far less, than the right-thinking mind. seek refuge in your soul; have there your heaven! scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts! the mind of pure devotion - even here - casts equally aside good deeds and bad, passing above them. unto pure devotion devote yourself: with perfect meditation comes perfect act, and the right-hearted rise - more certainly because they seek no gain - forth from the bands of body, step by step, to highest seats of bliss. when your firm soul hath shaken off those tangled oracles which ignorantly guide, then shall it soar to high neglect of what's denied or said, this way or that way, in doctrinal writ. troubled no longer by the priestly lore, safe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent on meditation. this is yog - and peace! arjuna. what is his mark who hath that steadfast heart, confirmed in holy meditation? how know we his speech, kesava? sits he, moves he like other men? krishna. when one, o pritha son! abandoning desires which shake the mind - finds in his soul full comfort for his soul, he hath attained the yog - that man is such! in sorrows not dejected, and in joys not overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress of passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms of lofty contemplation;--such an one is muni, is the sage, the true recluse! he who to none and nowhere overbound by ties of flesh, takes evil things and good neither desponding nor exulting, such bears wisdom plainest mark! he who shall draw as the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe under its shield, his five frail senses back under the spirit buckler from the world which else assails them, such an one, my prince! hath wisdom mark! things that solicit sense hold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes, the appetites of him who lives beyond depart,--aroused no more. yet may it chance, o son of kunti! that a governed mind shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest strong self-control by the roots. let him regain his kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit on me intent. that man alone is wise who keeps the mastery of himself! if one ponders on objects of the sense, there springs attraction; from attraction grows desire, desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds recklessness; then the memory - all betrayed - lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind, till purpose, mind, and man are all undone. but, if one deals with objects of the sense not loving and not hating, making them serve his free soul, which rests serenely lord, lo! such a man comes to tranquillity; and out of that tranquillity shall rise the end and healing of his earthly pains, since the will governed sets the soul at peace. the soul of the ungoverned is not his, nor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked, how grows serenity? and, wanting that, whence shall he hope for happiness? the mind that gives itself to follow shows of sense see its helm of wisdom rent away, and, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives to wreck and death. only with him, great prince! whose senses are not swayed by things of sense - only with him who holds his mastery, shows wisdom perfect. what is midnight-gloom to unenlightened souls shines wakeful day to his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day is known for night, thick night of ignorance, to his true-seeing eyes. such is the saint! and like the ocean, day by day receiving floods from all lands, which never overflows its boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving, fed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;-- so is the perfect one! to his soul ocean the world of sense pours streams of witchery; they leave him as they find, wiyout commotion, taking their tribute, but remaining sea. yea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh lives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free from pride, from passion, from the sin of \"self,\" toucheth tranquillity! o pritha son! that is the state of brahma! there rests no dread when that last step is reached! live where he will, die when he may, such passeth from all ‚plaining, to blest nirvana, with the gods, attaining. here endeth chapter ii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"sankhya-yog,\" or \"the book of doctrines.\" chapter iii arjuna. you whom all mortals praise, janardana! if meditation be a nobler thing than action, wherefore, then, great kesava! dost you impel me to this dreadful fight? now am i by your doubtful speech disturbed! tell me one thing, and tell me certainly; by what road shall i find the better end? krishna. i told you, blameless lord! there be two paths shown to this world; two schools of wisdom. first the sankhya, which doth save in way of works prescribed by reason; next, the yog, which bids attain by meditation, spiritually: yet these are one! no man shall ‚scape from act by shunning action; nay, and none shall come by mere renouncements unto perfectness. nay, and no jot of time, at any time, rests any actionless; his nature law compels him, even unwilling, into act; [for yought is act in fancy]. he who sits suppressing all the instruments of flesh, yet in his idle heart thinking on them, plays the inept and guilty hypocrite: but he who, with strong body serving mind, gives up his mortal powers to woryour work, not seeking gain, arjuna! such an one is honourable. do yours allotted task! work is more excellent than idleness; the body life proceeds not, lacking work. there is a task of holiness to do, unlike world-binding toil, which bind not the faithful soul; such earthly duty do free from desire, and you shalt well perform your heavenly purpose. speak prajapati - in the beginning, when all men were made, and, with mankind, the sacrifice - \"do this! work! sacrifice! increase and multiply with sacrifice! this shall be kamaduk, your ‚cow of plenty,' giving back her milk of all abundance. worship the gods thereby; the gods shall yield you grace. those meats ye crave the gods will grant to labour, when it pays tithes in the altar-flame. but if one eats fruits of the earth, rendering to kindly heaven no gift of toil, that thief steals from his world.\" who eat of food after their sacrifice are quit of fault, but they that spread a feast all for themselves, eat sin and drink of sin. by food the living live; food comes of rain, and rain comes by the pious sacrifice, and sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil; thus action is of brahmaa, who is one, the only, all-pervading; at all times present in sacrifice. he that abstains to help the rolling wheels of this great world, glutting his idle sense, lives a lost life, shameful and vain. existing for himself, self-concentrated, serving self alone, no part hath he in aught; nothing achieved, nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him; no hope of help for all the living things of earth depends from him. therefore, your task prescribed with spirit unattached gladly perform, since in performance of plain duty man mounts to his highest bliss. by works alone janak and ancient saints reached blessedness! moreover, for the upholding of your kind, action you should embrace. what the wise choose the unwise people take; what best men do the multitude will follow. look on me, you son of pritha! in the three wide worlds i am not bound to any toil, no height awaits to scale, no gift remains to gain, yet i act here! and, if i acted not - earnest and watchful - those that look to me for guidance, sinking back to sloth again because i slumbered, would decline from good, and i should break earthes order and commit her offspring unto ruin, bharata! even as the unknowing toil, wedded to sense, so let the enlightened toil, sense-freed, but set to bring the world deliverance, and its bliss; not sowing in those simple, busy hearts seed of despair. yea! let each play his part in all he finds to do, with unyoked soul. all things are everywhere by nature wrought in interaction of the qualities. the fool, cheated by self, thinks, \"this i did\" and \"that i wrought; \"but - ah, you strong-armed prince!-- a better-lessoned mind, knowing the play of visible things within the world of sense, and how the qualities must qualify, stand aloof even from his acts. the untaught live mixed with them, knowing not nature way, of highest aims unwitting, slow and dull. those make you not to stumble, having the light; but all your dues discharging, for my sake, with meditation centred inwardly, seeking no profit, sathis isfied, serene, heedless of issue - fight! they who shall keep my ordinance thus, the wise and willing hearts, have quittance from all issue of their acts; but those who disregard my ordinance, thinking they know, know nought, and fall to loss, confused and foolish. ‚sooth, the instructed one doth of his kind, following what fits him most: and lower creatures of their kind; in vain contending ‚gainst the law. needs must it be the objects of the sense will stir the sense to like and dislike, yet the enlightened man yields not to these, knowing them enemies. finally, this is better, that one do his own task as he may, even yough he fail, than take tasks not his own, yough they seem good. to die performing duty is no ill; but who seeks other roads shall wander still. arjuna. yet tell me, teacher! by what force doth man go to his ill, unwilling; as if one pushed him that evil path? krishna. kama it is! passion it is! born of the darknesses, which pusheth him. mighty of appetite, sinful, and strong is this!--man enemy! as smoke blots the white fire, as clinging rust mars the bright mirror, as the womb surrounds the babe unborn, so is the world of things foiled, soiled, enclosed in this desire of flesh. the wise fall, caught in it; the unresting foe it is of wisdom, wearing countless forms, fair but deceitful, subtle as a flame. sense, mind, and reason - these, o arjuna! are booty for it; in its play with these it maddens man, beguiling, blinding him. therefore, you noblest child of bharata! govern your heart! constrain the entangled sense! resist the false, soft sinfulness which saps knowledge and judgment! yea, the world is strong, but what discerns it stronger, and the mind strongest; and high o'er all the ruling soul. wherefore, perceiving him who reigns supreme, put forth full force of soul in your own soul! fight! vanquish foes and doubts, dear hero! slay what haunts you in fond shapes, and would betray! here endeth chapter iii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"karma-yog,\" or \"the book of virtue in work.\" chapter iv krishna. this deathless yoga, this deep union, i taught vivaswata, the lord of light; vivaswata to manu gave it; he to ikshwaku; so passed it down the line of all my royal rishis. then, with years, the truth grew dim and perished, noble prince! now once again to you it is declared - this ancient lore, this mystery supreme - seeing i find you votary and friend. arjuna. your birth, dear lord, was in these later days, and bright vivaswata preceded time! how shall i comprehend this thing you sayest, \"from the beginning it was i who taught?\" krishna. manifold the renewals of my birth have been, arjuna! and of your births, too! but mine i know, and yours you knowest not, o slayer of your foes! albeit i be unborn, undying, indestructible, the lord of all things living; not the less - by maya, by my magic which i stamp on floating nature-forms, the primal vast - i come, and go, and come. when righteousness declines, o bharata! when wickedness is strong, i rise, from age to age, and take visible shape, and move a man with men, succouring the good, thrusting the evil back, and setting virtue on her seat again. who knows the truth touching my births on earth and my divine work, when he quits the flesh puts on its load no more, falls no more down to earthly birth: to me he comes, dear prince! many there be who come! from fear set free, from anger, from desire; keeping their hearts fixed upon me - my faithful - purified by sacred flame of knowledge. such as these mix with my being. whoso worship me, them i exalt; but all men everywhere shall fall into my path; albeit, those souls which seek reward for works, make sacrifice now, to the lower gods. i say to you here have they their reward. but i am he made the four castes, and portioned them a place after their qualities and gifts. yea, i created, the reposeful; i that live immortally, made all those mortal births: for works soil not my essence, being works wrought uninvolved. who knows me acting thus unchained by action, action binds not him; and, so perceiving, all those saints of old worked, seeking for deliverance. work you as, in the days gone by, your fathers did. you sayst, perplexed, it hath been asked before by singers and by sages, \"what is act, and what inaction? \"i will teach you this, and, knowing, you shalt learn which work doth save needs must one rightly meditate those three - doing,--not doing,--and undoing. here thorny and dark the path is! he who sees how action may be rest, rest action - he is wisest ‚mid his kind; he hath the truth! he doeth well, acting or resting. freed in all his works from prickings of desire, burned clean in act by the white fire of truth, the wise call that man wise; and such an one, renouncing fruit of deeds, always content. always self-sathis isfying, if he works, doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul, which - quit of fear and hope - subduing self - rejecting outward impulse - yielding up to body need nothing save body, dwells sinless amid all sin, with equal calm taking what may befall, by grief unmoved, unmoved by joy, unenvyingly; the same in good and evil fortunes; nowise bound by bond of deeds. nay, but of such an one, whose crave is gone, whose soul is liberate, whose heart is set on truth - of such an one what work he does is work of sacrifice, which passeth purely into ash and smoke consumed upon the altar! all is then god! the sacrifice is brahma, the ghee and grain are brahma, the fire is brahma, the flesh it eats is brahma, and unto brahma attaineth he who, in such office, meditates on brahma. some votaries there be who serve the gods with flesh and altar-smoke; but other some who, lighting subtler fires, make purer rite with will of worship. of the which be they who, in white flame of continence, consume joys of the sense, delights of eye and ear, forgoing tender speech and sound of song: and they who, kindling fires with torch of truth, burn on a hidden altar-stone the bliss of youth and love, renouncing happiness: and they who lay for offering there their wealth, their penance, meditation, piety, their steadfast reading of the scrolls, their lore painfully gained with long austerities: and they who, making silent sacrifice, draw in their breath to feed the flame of yought, and breathe it forth to waft the heart on high, governing the ventage of each entering air lest one sigh pass which help not the soul: and they who, day by day denying needs, lay life itself upon the altar-flame, burning the body wan. lo! all these keep the rite of offering, as if they slew victims; and all thereby efface much sin. yea! and who feed on the immortal food left of such sacrifice, to brahmaa pass, to the unending. but for him that makes no sacrifice, he hath nor part nor lot even in the present world. how should he share another, o you glory of your line? in sight of brahmaa all these offerings are spread and are accepted! comprehend that all proceed by act; for knowing this, you shalt be quit of doubt. the sacrifice which knowledge pays is better than great gifts offered by wealth, since gifts' worth - o my prince! lies in the mind which gives, the will that serves: and these are gained by reverence, by strong search, by humble heed of those who see the truth and teach it. knowing truth, your heart no more will ache with error, for the truth shall show all things subdued to you, as you to me. moreover, son of pandu! wert you worst of all wrong-doers, this fair ship of truth should bear you safe and dry across the sea of your transgressions. as the kindled flame feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash, so unto ash, arjuna! unto nought the flame of knowledge wastes works' dross away! there is no purifier like thereto in all this world, and he who seeketh it shall find it - being grown perfect - in himself. believing, he receives it when the soul masters itself, and cleaves to truth, and comes - possessing knowledge - to the higher peace, the uttermost repose. but those untaught, and those wiyout full faith, and those who fear are shent; no peace is here or other where, no hope, nor happiness for whoso doubts. he that, being self-contained, hath vanquished doubt, disparting self from service, soul from works, enlightened and emancipate, my prince! works fetter him no more! cut then atwain with sword of wisdom, son of bharata! this doubt that binds your heart-beats! cleave the bond born of your ignorance! be bold and wise! give yourself to the field with me! arise! here endeth chapter iv. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"jnana yog,\" or \"the book of the religion of knowledge,\" chapter v arjuna. yet, krishna! at the one time you dost laud surcease of works, and, at another time, service through work. of these twain plainly tell which is the better way? krishna. to cease from works is well, and to do works in holiness is well; and both conduct to bliss supreme; but of these twain the better way is his who working piously refraineth not. that is the true renouncer, firm and fixed, who - seeking nought, rejecting nought - dwells proof against the \"opposites.\" o valiant prince! in doing, such breaks lightly from all deed: ‚this is the new scholar talks as they were two, this sankhya and this yoga: wise men know who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both! the region of high rest which sankhyans reach yogins attain. who sees these twain as one sees with clear eyes! yet such abstraction, chief! is hard to win wiyout much holiness. whoso is fixed in holiness, self-ruled, pure-hearted, lord of senses and of self, lost in the common life of all which lives - a \"yogayukt\" - he is a saint who wends straightway to brahma. such an one is not touched by taint of deeds. \"nought of myself i do!\" thus will he think-who holds the truth of truths - in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling; when he eats, or goes, or breathes; slumbers or talks, holds fast or loosens, opes his eyes or shuts; always assured \"this is the sense-world plays with senses.\"he that acts in yought of brahma, detaching end from act, with act content, the world of sense can no more stain his soul than waters mar the enamelled lotus-leaf. with life, with heart, with mind,-nay, with the help of all five senses - letting selfhood go - yogins toil ever towards their souls' release. such votaries, renouncing fruit of deeds, gain endless peace: the unvowed, the passion-bound, seeking a fruit from works, are fastened down. the embodied sage, withdrawn within his soul, at every act sits godlike in \"the town which hath nine gateways,\" neither doing aught nor causing any deed. this world's lord makes neither the work, nor passion for the work, nor lust for fruit of work; the man own self pushes to these! the master of this world takes on himself the good or evil deeds of no man - dwelling beyond! mankind errs here by folly, darkening knowledge. but, for whom that darkness of the soul is chased by light, splendid and clear shines manifest the truth as if a sun of wisdom sprang to shed its beams of dawn. him meditating still, him seeking, with him blended, stayed on him, the souls illuminated take that road which hath no turning back - their sins flung off by strength of faith. [who will may have this light; who hath it sees.] to him who wisely sees, the brahmaan with his scrolls and sanctities, the cow, the elephant, the unclean dog, the outcast gorging dog's meat, are all one. the world is overcome - aye! even here! by such as fix their faith on unity. the sinless brahmaa dwells in unity, and they in brahmaa. be not over-glad attaining joy, and be not over-sad encountering grief, but, stayed on brahmaa, still constant let each abide! the sage whose sou holds off from outer contacts, in himself finds bliss; to brahmaa joined by piety, his spirit tastes eternal peace. the joys springing from sense-life are but quickening wombs which breed sure griefs: those joys begin and end! the wise mind takes no pleasure, arjuna! in such as those! but if a man shall learn, even while he lives and bears his body chain, to master lust and anger, he is blest! he is the yukta; he hath happiness, contentment, light, within: his life is merged in brahmaa's life; he doth nirvana touch! thus go the rishis unto rest, who dwell with sins effaced, with doubts at end, with hearts governed and calm. glad in all good they live, nigh to the peace of god; and all those live who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath, subduing self and senses, knowing the soul! the saint who shuts outside his placid soul all touch of sense, letting no contact through; whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows, whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn equal and slow through nostrils still and close; that one-with organs, heart, and mind constrained, bent on deliverance, having put away passion, and fear, and rage;--hath, even now, obtained deliverance, ever and ever freed. yea! for he knows me who am he that heeds the sacrifice and worship, god revealed; and he who heeds not, being lord of worlds, lover of all that lives, god unrevealed, wherein who will shall find surety and shield! here ends chapter v. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"karmasanyasayog,\" or \"the book of religion by renouncing fruit of works.\" chapter vi krishna. therefore, who doeth work rightful to do, not seeking gain from work, that man, o prince! is sanyasi and yogi - both in one and he is neither who lights not the flame of sacrifice, nor setteth hand to task. regard as true renouncer him that makes worship by work, for who renounceth not works not as yogin. so is that well said: \"by works the votary doth rise to faith, and saintship is the ceasing from all works; because the perfect yogin acts - but acts unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds, setting result aside. let each man raise the self by soul, not trample down his self, since soul that is self's friend may grow self's foe. soul is self's friend when self doth rule o'er self, but self turns enemy if soul own self hates self as not itself. the sovereign soul of him who lives self-governed and at peace is centred in itself, taking alike pleasure and pain; heat, cold; glory and shame. he is the yogi, he is yukta, glad with joy of light and truth; dwelling apart upon a peak, with senses subjugate whereto the clod, the rock, the glistering gold show all as one. by this sign is he known being of equal grace to comrades, friends, chance-comers, strangers, lovers, enemies, aliens and kinsmen; loving all alike, evil or good. sequestered should he sit, steadfastly meditating, solitary, his youghts controlled, his passions laid away, quit of belongings. in a fair, still spot having his fixed abode,--not too much raised, nor yet too low,--let him abide, his goods a cloth, a deerskin, and the kusa-grass. there, setting hard his mind upon the one, restraining heart and senses, silent, calm, let him accomplish yoga, and achieve pureness of soul, holding immovable body and neck and head, his gaze absorbed upon his nose-end, rapt from all around, tranquil in spirit, free of fear, intent upon his brahmaacharya vow, devout, musing on me, lost in the yought of me. that yojin, so devoted, so controlled, comes to the peace beyond,--my peace, the peace of high nirvana! but for earthly needs religion is not his who too much fasts or too much feasts, nor his who sleeps away an idle mind; nor his who wears to waste his strength in vigils. nay, arjuna! call that the true piety which most removes earth-aches and ills, where one is moderate in eating and in resting, and in sport; measured in wish and act; sleeping betimes, waking betimes for duty. when the man, so living, centres on his soul the yought straitly restrained - untouched internally by stress of sense - then is he yukta. see! steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind; such is the likeness of the yogi's mind shut from sense-storms and burning bright to heaven. when mind broods placid, soothed with holy wont; when self contemplates self, and in itself hath comfort; when it knows the nameless joy beyond all scope of sense, revealed to soul - only to soul! and, knowing, wavers not, true to the farther truth; when, holding this, it deems no other treasure comparable, but, harboured there, cannot be stirred or shook by any gravest grief, call that state \"peace,\" that happy severance yoga; call that man the perfect yogin! steadfastly the will must toil thereto, till efforts end in ease, and yought has passed from thinking. shaking off all longings bred by dreams of fame and gain, shutting the doorways of the senses close with watchful ward; so, step by step, it comes to gift of peace assured and heart assuaged, when the mind dwells self-wrapped, and the soul broods cumberless. but, as often as the heart breaks - wild and wavering - from control, so oft let him re-curb it, let him rein it back to the soul governance; for perfect bliss grows only in the bosom tranquillised, the spirit passionless, purged from offence, vowed to the infinite. he who thus vows his soul to the supreme soul, quitting sin, passes unhindered to the endless bliss of unity with brahmaa. he so vowed, so blended, sees the life-soul resident in all things living, and all living things in that life-soul contained. and whoso thus discerneth me in all, and all in me, i never let him go; nor looseneth he hold upon me; but, dwell he where he may, whate'er his life, in me he dwells and lives, because he knows and worships me, who dwell in all which lives, and cleaves to me in all. arjuna! if a man sees everywhere - taught by his own similitude - one life, one essence in the evil and the good, hold him a yogi, yea! well-perfected! arjuna. slayer of madhu! yet again, this yog, this peace, derived from equanimity, made known by you - i see no fixity therein, no rest, because the heart of men is unfixed, krishna! rash, tumultuous, wilful and strong. it were all one, i think, to hold the wayward wind, as tame man heart. krishna. hero long-armed! beyond denial, hard man heart is to restrain, and wavering; yet may it grow restrained by habit, prince! by wont of self-command. this yog, i say, cometh not lightly to the ungoverned ones; but he who will be master of himself shall win it, if he stoutly strive thereto. arjuna. and what road goeth he who, having faith, fails, krishna! in the striving; falling back from holiness, missing the perfect rule? is he not lost, straying from brahmaa's light, like the vain cloud, which floats ‚twixt earth and heaven when lightning splits it, and it vanisheth? fain would i hear you answer me herein, since, krishna! none save you can clear the doubt. krishna. he is not lost, you son of pritha! no! nor earth, nor heaven is forfeit, even for him, because no heart that holds one right desire treadeth the road of loss! he who should fail, desiring righteousness, cometh at death unto the region of the just; dwells there measureless years, and being born anew, beginneth life again in some fair home amid the mild and happy. it may chance he doth descend into a yogin house on virtue's breast; but that is rare! such birth is hard to be obtained on this earth, chief! so hath he back again what heights of heart he did achieve, and so he strives anew to perfectness, with better hope, dear prince! for by the old desire he is drawn on unwittingly; and only to desire the purity of yog is to pass beyond the sabdabrahma, the spoken ved. but, being yogi, striving strong and long, purged from transgressions, perfected by births following on births, he plants his feet at last upon the farther path. such as one ranks above ascetics, higher than the wise, beyond achievers of vast deeds! be you yogi arjuna! and of such believe, truest and best is he who worships me with inmost soul, stayed on my mystery! here endeth chapter vi. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"atmasanyamayog,\" or \"the book of religion by self-restraint.\" chapter vii krishna. learn now, dear prince! how, if your soul be set ever on me - still exercising yog, still making me your refuge - you shalt come most surely unto perfect hold of me. i will declare to you that utmost lore, whole and particular, which, when you knowest, leaveth no more to know here in this world. of many yousand mortals, one, perchance, striveth for truth; and of those few that strive - nay, and rise high - one only - here and there - know me, as i am, the very truth. earth, water, flame, air, ether, life, and mind, and individuality - those eight make up the showing of me, manifest. these be my lower nature; learn the higher, whereby, you valiant one! this universe is, by its principle of life, produced; whereby the worlds of visible things are born as from a yoni. know! i am that womb: i make and i unmake this universe: than me there is no other master, prince! no other maker! all these hang on me as hangs a row of pearls upon its string. i am the fresh taste of the water; i the silver of the moon, the gold o' the sun, the word of worship in the veds, the thrill that passeth in the ether, and the strength of man shed seed. i am the good sweet smell of the moistened earth, i am the fire's red light, the vital air moving in all which moves, the holiness of hallowed souls, the root undying, whence hath sprung whatever is; the wisdom of the wise, the intellect of the informed, the greatness of the great. the splendour of the splendid. arjuna! these am i, free from passion and desire; yet am i right desire in all who yearn, chief of the bharata! for all those moods, soothfast, or passionate, or ignorant, which nature frames, deduce from me; but all are merged in me - not i in them! the world - deceived by those three qualities of being - wotteth not me who am outside them all, above them all, eternal! hard it is to pierce that veil divine of various shows which hideth me; yet they who worship me pierce it and pass beyond. i am not known to evil-doers, nor to foolish ones, nor to the base and churlish; nor to those whose mind is cheated by the show of things, nor those that take the way of asuras. four sorts of mortals know me: he who weeps, arjuna! and the man who yearns to know; and he who toils to help; and he who sits certain of me, enlightened. of these four, o prince of india! highest, nearest, best that last is, the devout soul, wise, intent upon \"the one.\" dear, above all, am i to him; and he is dearest unto me! all four are good, and seek me; but mine own, the true of heart, the faithful - stayed on me, taking me as their utmost blessedness, they are not \"mine,\"but i - even i myself! at end of many births to me they come! yet hard the wise mahatma is to find, that man who sayeth, \"all is vasudev!\" there be those, too, whose knowledge, turned aside by this desire or that, gives them to serve some lower gods, with various rites, constrained by that which mouldeth them. unto all such - worship what shrine they will, what shapes, in faith - ‚this is i who give them faith! i am content! the heart thus asking favour from its god, darkened but ardent, hath the end it craves, the lesser blessing - but ‚this is i who give! yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap: those men of little minds, who worship so, go where they worship, passing with their gods. but mine come unto me! blind are the eyes which deem the unmanifested manifest, not comprehending me in my true self! imperishable, viewless, undeclared, hidden behind my magic veil of shows, i am not seen by all; i am not known - unborn and changeless - to the idle world. but i, arjuna! know all things which were, and all which are, and all which are to be, albeit not one among them know me! by passion for the \"pairs of opposites,\" by those twain snares of like and dislike, prince! all creatures live bewildered, save some few who, quit of sins, holy in act, informed, freed from the \"opposites,\"and fixed in faith, cleave unto me. who cleave, who seek in me refuge from birth and death, those have the truth! those know me brahmaa; know me soul of souls, the adhyatman; know karma, my work; know i am adhibhuta, lord of life, and adhidaiva, lord of all the gods, and adhiyajna, lord of sacrifice; worship me well, with hearts of love and faith, and find and hold me in the hour of death. here endeth chapter vii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"vijnanayog,\" or \"the book of religion by discernment.\" chapter viii arjuna. who is that brahmaa? what that soul of souls, the adhyatman? what, you best of all! your work, the karma? tell me what it is you namest adhibhuta? what again means adhidaiva? yea, and how it comes you canst be adhiyajna in your flesh? slayer of madhu! further, make me know how good men find you in the hour of death? krishna. i brahmaa am! the one eternal god, and adhyatman is my being's name, the soul of souls! what goeth forth from me, causing all life to live, is karma called: and, manifested in divided forms, i am the adhibhuta, lord of lives; and adhidaiva, lord of all the gods, because i am purusha, who begets. and adhiyajna, lord of sacrifice, i - speaking with you in this body here - am, you embodied one! (for all the shrines flame unto me!) and, at the hour of death, he that hath meditated me alone, in putting off his flesh, comes forth to me, enters into my being - doubt you not! but, if he meditated otherwise at hour of death, in putting off the flesh, he goes to what he looked for, arjuna! because the soul is fashioned to its like. have me, then, in your heart always! and fight! you too, when heart and mind are fixed on me, shalt surely come to me! all come who cleave with never-wavering will of firmest faith, owning none other gods: all come to me, the uttermost, purusha, holiest! whoso hath known me, lord of sage and singer, ancient of days; of all the three worlds stay, boundless,--but unto every atom bringer of that which quickens it: whoso, i say, hath known my form, which passeth mortal knowing; seen my effulgence - which no eye hath seen - than the sun's burning gold more brightly glowing, dispersing darkness,--unto him hath been right life! and, in the hour when life is ending, with mind set fast and trustful piety, drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending, in happy peace that faithful one doth die,-- in glad peace passeth to purusha's heaven. the place which they who read the vedas name aksharam, \"ultimate;\" whereto have striven saints and ascetics - their road is the same. that way - the highest way - goes he who shuts the gates of all his senses, locks desire safe in his heart, centres the vital airs upon his parting yought, steadfastly set; and, murmuring om, the sacred syllable - emblem of brahma - dies, meditating me. for who, none other gods regarding, looks ever to me, easily am i gained by such a yogi; and, attaining me, they fall not - those mahatmas - back to birth, to life, which is the place of pain, which ends, but take the way of utmost blessedness. the worlds, arjuna!--even brahmaa's world - roll back again from death to life's unrest; but they, o arjuna! that reach to me, taste birth no more. if ye know brahmaa's day which is a yousand yugas; if ye know the yousand yugas making brahmaa's night, then know ye day and night as he doth know! when that vast dawn doth break, the invisible is brought anew into the visible; when that deep night doth darken, all which is fades back again to him who sent it forth; yea! this vast company of living things - again and yet again produced - expires at brahmaa's nightfall; and, at brahmaa's dawn, riseth, wiyout its will, to life new-born. but - higher, deeper, innermost - abides another life, not like the life of sense, escaping sight, unchanging. this endures when all created things have passed away: this is that life named the unmanifest, the infinite! the all! the uttermost. thither arriving none return. that life is mine, and i am there! and, prince! by faith which wanders not, there is a way to come thither. i, the purusha, i who spread the universe around me - in whom dwell all living things - may so be reached and seen! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . richer than holy fruit on vedas growing, greater than gifts, better than prayer or fast, such wisdom is! the yogi, this way knowing, comes to the utmost perfect peace at last. here endeth chapter viii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"aksharaparabrahmaayog,\" or \"the book of religion by devotion to the one supreme god.\" chapter ix krishna. now will i open unto you - whose heart rejects not - that last lore, deepest-concealed, that farthest secret of my heavens and earths, which but to know shall set you free from ills,-- a royal lore! a kingly mystery! yea! for the soul such light as purgeth it from every sin; a light of holiness with inmost splendour shining; plain to see; easy to walk by, inexhaustible! they that receive not this, failing in faith to grasp the greater wisdom, reach not me, destroyer of your foes! they sink anew into the realm of flesh, where all things change! by me the whole vast universe of things is spread abroad;--by me, the unmanifest! in me are all existences contained; not i in them! yet they are not contained, those visible things! receive and strive to embrace the mystery majestical! my being - creating all, sustaining all - still dwells outside of all! see! as the shoreless airs move in the measureless space, but are not space, [and space were space wiyout the moving airs]; so all things are in me, but are not i. at closing of each kalpa, indian prince! all things which be back to my being come: at the beginning of each kalpa, all issue new-born from me. by energy and help of prakriti my outer self, again, and yet again, i make go forth the realms of visible things - wiyout their will - all of them - by the power of prakriti. yet these great makings, prince! involve me not enchain me not! i sit apart from them, other, and higher, and free; nowise attached! thus doth the stuff of worlds, moulded by me, bring forth all that which is, moving or still, living or lifeless! thus the worlds go on! the minds untaught mistake me, veiled in form;-- naught see they of my secret presence, nought of my hid nature, ruling all which lives. vain hopes pursuing, vain deeds doing; fed on vainest knowledge, senselessly they seek an evil way, the way of brutes and fiends. but my mahatmas, those of noble soul who tread the path celestial, worship me with hearts unwandering,--knowing me the source, the eternal source, of life. unendingly they glorify me; seek me; keep their vows of reverence and love, with changeless faith adoring me. yea, and those too adore, who, offering sacrifice of wakened hearts, have sense of one pervading spirit stress, one force in every place, yough manifold! i am the sacrifice! i am the prayer! i am the funeral-cake set for the dead! i am the healing herb! i am the ghee, the mantra, and the flame, and that which burns! i am-of all this boundless universe- the father, mother, ancestor, and guard! the end of learning! that which purifies in lustral water! i am om! i am rig-veda, sama-veda, yajur-ved; the way, the fosterer, the lord, the judge, the witness; the abode, the refuge-house, the friend, the fountain and the sea of life which sends, and swallows up; treasure of worlds and treasure-chamber! seed and seed-sower, whence endless harvests spring! sun's heat is mine; heaven's rain is mine to grant or to withhold; death am i, and immortal life i am, arjuna! sat and asat, visible life, and life invisible! yea! those who learn the threefold veds, who drink the soma-wine, purge sins, pay sacrifice - from me they earn passage to swarga; where the meats divine of great gods feed them in high indra heaven. yet they, when that prodigious joy is o'er, paradise spent, and wage for merits given, come to the world of death and change once more. they had their recompense! they stored their treasure, following the threefold scripture and its writ; who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure of joy which comes and goes! i grant them it! but to those blessed ones who worship me, turning not otherwhere, with minds set fast, i bring assurance of full bliss beyond. nay, and of hearts which follow other gods in simple faith, their prayers arise to me, o arjuna! yough they pray wrongfully; for i am the receiver and the lord of every sacrifice, which these know not rightfully; so they fall to earth again! who follow gods go to their gods; who vow their souls to pitris go to pitris; minds to evil bhuts given o'er sink to the bhuts; and whoso loveth me cometh to me. whoso shall offer me in faith and love a leaf, a flower, a fruit, water poured forth, that offering i accept, lovingly made with pious will. whate'er you doest, prince! eating or sacrificing, giving gifts, praying or fasting, let it all be done for me, as mine. so shalt you free yourself from karmabandh, the chain which holdeth men to good and evil issue, so shalt come safe unto me-when you art quit of flesh - by faith and abdication joined to me! i am alike for all! i know not hate, i know not favour! what is made is mine! but them that worship me with love, i love; they are in me, and i in them! nay, prince! if one of evil life turn in his yought straightly to me, count him amidst the good; he hath the high way chosen; he shall grow righteous ere long; he shall attain that peace which changes not. you prince of india! be certain none can perish, trusting me! o pritha son! whoso will turn to me, yough they be born from the very womb of sin, woman or man; sprung of the vaisya caste or lowly disregarded sudra,--all plant foot upon the highest path; how then the holy brahmaan and my royal saints? ah! ye who into this ill world are come - fleeting and false - set your faith fast on me! fix heart and yought on me! adore me! bring offerings to me! make me prostrations! make me your supremest joy! and, undivided, unto my rest your spirits shall be guided. here ends chapter ix. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"rajavidyarajaguhyayog,\" or \"the book of religion by the kingly knowledge and the kingly mystery.\" chapter x krishna. hear farther yet, you long-armed lord! these latest words i say - uttered to bring you bliss and peace, who lovest me alway - not the great company of gods nor kingly rishis know my nature, who have made the gods and rishis long ago; he only know-only he is free of sin, and wise, who see me, lord of the worlds, with faith-enlightened eyes, unborn, undying, unbegun. whatever natures be to mortal men distributed, those natures spring from me! intellect, skill, enlightenment, endurance, self-control, truthfulness, equability, and grief or joy of soul, and birth and death, and fearfulness, and fearlessness, and shame, and honour, and sweet harmlessness, and peace which is the same whate'er befalls, and mirth, and tears, and piety, and thrift, and wish to give, and will to help,--all cometh of my gift! the seven chief saints, the elders four, the lordly manus set - sharing my work - to rule the worlds, these too did i beget; and rishis, pitris, manus, all, by one yought of my mind; thence did arise, to fill this world, the races of mankind; wherefrom who comprehends my reign of mystic majesty - that truth of truths - is thenceforth linked in faultless faith to me: yea! knowing me the source of all, by me all creatures wrought, the wise in spirit cleave to me, into my being brought; hearts fixed on me; breaths breathed to me; praising me, each to each, so have they happiness and peace, with pious yought and speech; and unto these - thus serving well, thus loving ceaselessly - i give a mind of perfect mood, whereby they draw to me; and, all for love of them, within their darkened souls i dwell, and, with bright rays of wisdom lamp, their ignorance dispel. arjuna. yes! you art parabrahma! the high abode! the great purification! you art god eternal, all-creating, holy, first, wiyout beginning! lord of lords and gods! declared by all the saints - by narada, vyasa asita, and devalas; and here yourself declaring unto me! what you hast said now know i to be truth, o kesava! that neither gods nor men nor demons comprehend your mystery made manifest, divinest! you yourself yourself alone dost know, maker supreme! master of all the living! lord of gods! king of the universe! to you alone belongs to tell the heavenly excellence of those perfections wherewith you dost fill these worlds of yours; pervading, immanent! how shall i learn, supremest mystery! to know you, yough i muse continually? under what form of yours unnumbered forms may you be grasped? ah! yet again recount, clear and complete, your great appearances, the secrets of your majesty and might, you high delight of men! never enough can mine ears drink the amrit of such words! krishna. hanta! so be it! kuru prince! i will to you unfold some portions of my majesty, whose powers are manifold! i am the spirit seated deep in every creature's heart; from me they come; by me they live; at my word they depart! vishnu of the adityas i am, those lords of light; maritchi of the maruts, the kings of storm and blight; by day i gleam, the golden sun of burning cloudless noon; by night, amid the asterisms i glide, the dappled moon! of vedas i am sama-ved, of gods in indra heaven vasava; of the faculties to living beings given the mind which apprehends and thinks; of rudras sankara; of yakshas and of rakshasas, vittesh; and pavaka of vasus, and of mountain-peaks meru; vrihaspati know me ‚mid planetary powers; ‚mid warriors heavenly skanda; of all the water-floods the sea which drinketh each, and bhrigu of the holy saints, and om of sacred speech; of prayers the prayer ye whisper; of hills himala's snow, and aswattha, the fig-tree, of all the trees that grow; of the devarshis, narada; and chitrarath of them that sing in heaven, and kapila of munis, and the gem of flying steeds, uchchaisravas, from amrit-wave which burst; of elephants airavata; of males the best and first; of weapons heaven's hot thunderbolt; of cows white kamadhuk, from whose great milky udder-teats all hearts' desires are strook; vasuki of the serpent-tribes, round mandara entwined; and yousand-fanged ananta, on whose broad coils reclined leans vishnu; and of water-things varuna; aryam of pitris, and, of those that judge, yama the judge i am; of daityas dread prahlada; of what metes days and years, time's self i am; of woodland-beasts-buffaloes, deers, and bears-the lordly-painted tiger; of birds the vast garud, the whirlwind ‚mid the winds; ‚mid chiefs rama with blood imbrued, makar ‚mid fishes of the sea, and ganges ‚mid the streams; yea! first, and last, and centre of all which is or seems i am, arjuna! wisdom supreme of what is wise, words on the uttering lips i am, and eyesight of the eyes, and \"a\" of written characters, dwandwa of knitted speech, and endless life, and boundless love, whose power sustaineth each; and bitter death which seizes all, and joyous sudden birth, which brings to light all beings that are to be on earth; and of the viewless virtues, fame, fortune, song am i, and memory, and patience; and craft, and constancy: of vedic hymns the vrihatsam, of metres gayatri, of months the margasirsha, of all the seasons three the flower-wreathed spring; in dicer's-play the conquering double-eight; the splendour of the splendid, and the greatness of the great, victory i am, and action! and the goodness of the good, and vasudev of vrishni's race, and of this pandu brood yourself!--yea, my arjuna! yourself; for you art mine! of poets usana, of saints vyasa, sage divine; the policy of conquerors, the potency of kings, the great unbroken silence in learning's secret things; the lore of all the learned, the seed of all which springs. living or lifeless, still or stirred, whatever beings be, none of them is in all the worlds, but it exists by me! nor tongue can tell, arjuna! nor end of telling come of these my boundless glories, whereof i teach you some; for wheresoe'er is wondrous work, and majesty, and might, from me hath all proceeded. receive you this aright! yet how should you receive, o prince! the vastness of this word? i, who am all, and made it all, abide its separate lord! here endeth chapter x. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"vibhuti yog,\" or \"the book of religion by the heavenly perfections.\" chapter xi arjuna. this, for my soul peace, have i heard from you, the unfolding of the mystery supreme named adhyatman; comprehending which, my darkness is dispelled; for now i know - o lotus-eyed!--whence is the birth of men, and whence their death, and what the majesties of yours immortal rule. fain would i see, as you yourself declar'st it, sovereign lord! the likeness of that glory of your form wholly revealed. o you divinest one! if this can be, if i may bear the sight, make yourself visible, lord of all prayers! show me your very self, the eternal god! krishna. gaze, then, you son of pritha! i manifest for you those hundred yousand yousand shapes that clothe my mystery: i show you all my semblances, infinite, rich, divine, my changeful hues, my countless forms. see! in this face of mine, adityas, vasus, rudras, aswins, and maruts; see wonders unnumbered, indian prince! revealed to none save you. behold! this is the universe!--look! what is live and dead i gather all in one - in me! gaze, as your lips have said, on god eternal, very god! see me! see what you prayest! you canst not!--nor, with human eyes, arjuna! ever mayest! therefore i give you sense divine. have other eyes, new light! and, look! this is my glory, unveiled to mortal sight! sanjaya. then, o king! the god, so saying, stood, to pritha son displaying all the splendour, wonder, dread of his vast almighty-head. out of countless eyes beholding, out of countless mouths commanding, countless mystic forms enfolding in one form: supremely standing countless radiant glories wearing, countless heavenly weapons bearing, crowned with garlands of star-clusters, robed in garb of woven lustres, breathing from his perfect presence breaths of every subtle essence of all heavenly odours; shedding blinding brilliance; overspreading - boundless, beautiful - all spaces with his all-regarding faces; so he showed! if there should rise suddenly within the skies sunburst of a yousand suns flooding earth with beams undeemed-of, then might be that holy one's majesty and radiance dreamed of! so did pandu's son behold all this universe enfold all its huge diversity into one vast shape, and be visible, and viewed, and blended in one body - subtle, splendid, nameless - the all-comprehending god of gods, the never-ending deity! but, sore amazed, thrilled, o'erfilled, dazzled, and dazed, arjuna knelt; and bowed his head, and clasped his palms; and cried, and said: arjuna. yea! i have seen! i see! lord! all is wrapped in you! the gods are in your glorious frame! the creatures of earth, and heaven, and hell in your divine form dwell, and in your countenance shine all the features of brahmaa, sitting lone upon his lotus-throne; of saints and sages, and the serpent races ananta, vasuki; yea! mightiest lord! i see your yousand yousand arms, and breasts, and faces, and eyes,--on every side perfect, diversified; and nowhere end of you, nowhere beginning, nowhere a centre! shifts - wherever soul gaze lifts - your central self, all-wielding, and all-winning! infinite king! i see the anadem on you, the club, the shell, the discus; see you burning in beams insufferable, lighting earth, heaven, and hell with brilliance blazing, glowing, flashing; turning darkness to dazzling day, look i whichever way; ah, lord! i worship you, the undivided, the uttermost of yought, the treasure-palace wrought to hold the wealth of the worlds; the shield provided to shelter virtue's laws; the fount whence life's stream draws all waters of all rivers of all being: the one unborn, unending: unchanging and unblending! with might and majesty, past yought, past seeing! silver of moon and gold of sun are glories rolled from your great eyes; your visage, beaming tender throughout the stars and skies, doth to warm life surprise your universe. the worlds are filled with wonder of your perfections! space star-sprinkled, and void place from pole to pole of the blue, from bound to bound, hath you in every spot, you, you!--where you art not, o holy, marvellous form! is nowhere found! o mystic, awful one! at sight of you, made known, the three worlds quake; the lower gods draw nigh you; they fold their palms, and bow body, and breast, and brow, and, whispering worship, laud and magnify you! rishis and siddhas cry \"hail! highest majesty!\" from sage and singer breaks the hymn of glory in dulcet harmony, sounding the praise of you; while countless companies take up the story, rudras, who ride the storms, the adityas' shining forms, vasus and sadhyas, viswas, ushmapas; maruts, and those great twins the heavenly, fair, aswins, gandharvas, rakshasas, siddhas, and asuras,-- these see you, and revere in sudden-stricken fear; yea! the worlds,--seeing you with form stupendous, with faces manifold, with eyes which all behold, unnumbered eyes, vast arms, members tremendous, flanks, lit with sun and star, feet planted near and far, tushes of terror, mouths wrathful and tender;-- the three wide worlds before you adore, as i adore you, quake, as i quake, to witness so much splendour! i mark you strike the skies with front, in wondrous wise huge, rainbow-painted, glittering; and your mouth opened, and orbs which see all things, whatever be in all your worlds, east, west, and north and south. o eyes of god! o head! my strength of soul is fled, gone is heart's force, rebuked is mind's desire! when i behold you so, with awful brows a-glow, with burning glance, and lips lighted by fire fierce as those flames which shall consume, at close of all, earth, heaven! ah me! i see no earth and heaven! you, lord of lords! i see, you only-only you! now let your mercy unto me be given, you refuge of the world! lo! to the cavern hurled of your wide-opened throat, and lips white-tushed, i see our noblest ones, great dhritarashtra's sons, bhishma, drona, and karna, caught and crushed! the kings and chiefs drawn in, that gaping gorge within; the best of both these armies torn and riven! between your jaws they lie mangled full bloodily, ground into dust and death! like streams down-driven with helpless haste, which go in headlong furious flow straight to the gulfing deeps of the unfilled ocean, so to that flaming cave those heroes great and brave pour, in unending streams, with helpless motion! like moths which in the night flutter towards a light, drawn to their fiery doom, flying and dying, so to their death still throng, blind, dazzled, borne along ceaselessly, all those multitudes, wild flying! you, that hast fashioned men, devourest them again, one with another, great and small, alike! the creatures whom you mak'st, with flaming jaws you tak'st, lapping them up! lord god! your terrors strike from end to end of earth, filling life full, from birth to death, with deadly, burning, lurid dread! ah, vishnu! make me know why is your visage so? who art you, feasting thus upon your dead? who? awful deity! i bow myself to you, namostu te, devavara! prasid! o mightiest lord! rehearse why hast you face so fierce? whence doth this aspect horrible proceed? krishna. you seest me as time who kills, time who brings all to doom, the slayer time, ancient of days, come hither to consume; excepting you, of all these hosts of hostile chiefs arrayed, there stands not one shall leave alive the battlefield! dismayed no longer be! arise! obtain renown! destroy your foes! fight for the kingdom waiting you when you hast vanquished those. by me they fall - not you! the stroke of death is dealt them now, even as they show thus gallantly; my instrument art you! strike, strong-armed prince, at drona! at bhishma strike! deal death on karna, jyadratha; stay all their warlike breath! ‚this is i who bid them perish! you wilt but slay the slain; fight! they must fall, and you must live, victor upon this plain! sanjaya. hearing mighty keshav's word, tremblingly that helmed lord clasped his lifted palms, and - praying grace of krishna - stood there, saying, with bowed brow and accents broken, these words, timorously spoken: arjuna. worthily, lord of might! the whole world hath delight in your surpassing power, obeying you; the rakshasas, in dread at sight of you, are sped to all four quarters; and the company of siddhas sound your name. how should they not proclaim your majesties, divinest, mightiest? you brahma, than brahmaa greater! you infinite creator! you god of gods, life's dwelling-place and rest! you, of all souls the soul! the comprehending whole! of being formed, and formless being the framer; o utmost one! o lord! older than eld, who stored the worlds with wealth of life! o treasure-claimer, who wottest all, and art wisdom yourself! o part in all, and all; for all from you have risen numberless now i see the aspects are of you! vayu you art, and he who keeps the prison of narak, yama dark; and agni's shining spark; varuna's waves are your waves. moon and starlight are yours! prajapati art you, and ‚this is to you they knelt in worshipping the old world's far light, the first of mortal men. again, you god! again a yousand yousand times be magnified! honour and worship be - glory and praise,--to you namo, namaste, cried on every side; cried here, above, below, uttered when you dost go, uttered where you dost come! namo! we call; namostu! god adored! namostu! nameless lord! hail to you! praise to you! you one in all; for you art all! yea, you! ah! if in anger now you should remember i did think you friend, speaking with easy speech, as men use each to each; did call you \"krishna,\" \"prince,\" nor comprehend your hidden majesty, the might, the awe of you; did, in my heedlessness, or in my love, on journey, or in jest, or when we lay at rest, sitting at council, straying in the grove, alone, or in the throng, do you, most holy! wrong, be your grace granted for that witless sin! for you art, now i know, father of all below, of all above, of all the worlds within guru of gurus; more to reverence and adore than all which is adorable and high! how, in the wide worlds three should any equal be? should any other share your majesty? therefore, with body bent and reverent intent, i praise, and serve, and seek you, asking grace. as father to a son, as friend to friend, as one who loveth to his lover, turn your face in gentleness on me! good is it i did see this unknown marvel of your form! but fear mingles with joy! retake, dear lord! for pity's sake yours earthly shape, which earthly eyes may bear! be merciful, and show the visage that i know; let me regard you, as of yore, arrayed with disc and forehead-gem, with mace and anadem, you that sustainest all things! undismayed let me once more behold the form i loved of old, you of the yousand arms and countless eyes! this frightened heart is fain to see restored again my charioteer, in krishna kind disguise. krishna. yea! you hast seen, arjuna! because i loved you well, the secret countenance of me, revealed by mystic spell, shining, and wonderful, and vast, majestic, manifold, which none save you in all the years had favour to behold; for not by vedas cometh this, nor sacrifice, nor alms, nor works well-done, nor penance long, nor prayers, nor chaunted psalms, that mortal eyes should bear to view the immortal soul unclad, prince of the kurus! this was kept for you alone! be glad! let no more trouble shake your heart, because yours eyes have seen my terror with my glory. as i before have been so will i be again for you; with lightened heart behold! once more i am your krishna, the form you knew'st of old! sanjaya. these words to arjuna speak vasudev, and straight did take back again the semblance dear of the well-loved charioteer; peace and joy it did restore when the prince beheld once more mighty brahmaa's form and face clothed in krishna gentle grace. arjuna. now that i see come back, janardana! this friendly human frame, my mind can think calm youghts once more; my heart beats still again! krishna. yea! it was wonderful and terrible to view me as you didst, dear prince! the gods dread and desire continually to view! yet not by vedas, nor from sacrifice, nor penance, nor gift-giving, nor with prayer shall any so behold, as you hast seen! only by fullest service, perfect faith, and uttermost surrender am i known and seen, and entered into, indian prince! who doeth all for me; who findeth me in all; adoreth always; loveth all which i have made, and me, for love's sole end that man, arjuna! unto me doth wend. here endeth chapter xi. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"viswarupadarsanam,\" or \"the book of the manifesting of the one and manifold.\" chapter xii arjuna. lord! of the men who serve you - true in heart - as god revealed; and of the men who serve, worshipping you unrevealed, unbodied, far, which take the better way of faith and life? krishna. whoever serve me - as i show myself - constantly true, in full devotion fixed, those hold i very holy. but who serve - worshipping me the one, the invisible, the unrevealed, unnamed, unthinkable, uttermost, all-pervading, highest, sure - who thus adore me, mastering their sense, of one set mind to all, glad in all good, these blessed souls come unto me. yet, hard the travail is for such as bend their minds to reach the unmanifest that viewless path shall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh! but whereso any doeth all his deeds renouncing self for me, full of me, fixed to serve only the highest, night and day musing on me - him will i swiftly lift forth from life's ocean of distress and death, whose soul clings fast to me. cling you to me! clasp me with heart and mind! so shalt you dwell surely with me on high. but if your yought droops from such height; if you be'st weak to set body and soul upon me constantly, despair not! give me lower service! seek to reach me, worshipping with steadfast will; and, if you canst not worship steadfastly, work for me, toil in works pleasing to me! for he that laboureth right for love of me shall finally attain! but, if in this your faint heart fails, bring me your failure! find refuge in me! let fruits of labour go, renouncing hope for me, with lowliest heart, so shalt you come; for, yough to know is more than diligence, yet worship better is than knowing, and renouncing better still. near to renunciation - very near - dwelleth eternal peace! who hateth nought of all which lives, living himself benign, compassionate, from arrogance exempt, exempt from love of self, unchangeable by good or ill; patient, contented, firm in faith, mastering himself, true to his word, seeking me, heart and soul; vowed unto me,-- that man i love! who troubleth not his kind, and is not troubled by them; clear of wrath, living too high for gladness, grief, or fear, that man i love! who, dwelling quiet-eyed, stainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed, working with me, yet from all works detached, that man i love! who, fixed in faith on me, dotes upon none, scorns none; rejoices not, and grieves not, letting good or evil hap light when it will, and when it will depart, that man i love! who, unto friend and foe keeping an equal heart, with equal mind bears shame and glory; with an equal peace takes heat and cold, pleasure and pain; abides quit of desires, hears praise or calumny in passionless restraint, unmoved by each; linked by no ties to earth, steadfast in me, that man i love! but most of all i love those happy ones to whom ‚this is life to live in single fervid faith and love unseeing, drinking the blessed amrit of my being! here endeth chapter xii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"bhaktiyog,\" or\"the book of the religion of faith.\" chapter xiii arjuna. now would i hear, o gracious kesava! of life which seems, and soul beyond, which sees, and what it is we know-or think to know. krishna. yea! son of kunti! for this flesh ye see is kshetra, is the field where life disports; and that which views and knows it is the soul, kshetrajna. in all \"fields,\" you indian prince! i am kshetrajna. i am what surveys! only that knowledge knows which knows the known by the knower! what it is, that \"field\" of life, what qualities it hath, and whence it is, and why it changeth, and the faculty that wotteth it, the mightiness of this, and how it wotteth-hear these things from me! . . . . . . . . . . . . the elements, the conscious life, the mind, the unseen vital force, the nine strange gates of the body, and the five domains of sense; desire, dislike, pleasure and pain, and yought deep-woven, and persistency of being; these all are wrought on matter by the soul! humbleness, truthfulness, and harmlessness, patience and honour, reverence for the wise. purity, constancy, control of self, contempt of sense-delights, self-sacrifice, perception of the certitude of ill in birth, death, age, disease, suffering, and sin; detachment, lightly holding unto home, children, and wife, and all that bind men; an ever-tranquil heart in fortunes good and fortunes evil, with a will set firm to worship me - me only! ceasing not; loving all solitudes, and shunning noise of foolish crowds; endeavours resolute to reach perception of the utmost soul, and grace to understand what gain it were so to attain,--this is true wisdom, prince! and what is otherwise is ignorance! now will i speak of knowledge best to know- that truth which giveth man amrit to drink, the truth of him, the para-brahma, the all, the uncreated;; not asat, not sat, not form, nor the unformed; yet both, and more;-- whose hands are everywhere, and everywhere planted his feet, and everywhere his eyes beholding, and his ears in every place hearing, and all his faces everywhere enlightening and encompassing his worlds. glorified in the senses he hath given, yet beyond sense he is; sustaining all, yet dwells he unattached: of forms and modes master, yet neither form nor mode hath he; he is within all beings - and wiyout - motionless, yet still moving; not discerned for subtlety of instant presence; close to all, to each; yet measurelessly far! not manifold, and yet subsisting still in all which lives; for ever to be known as the sustainer, yet, at the end of times, he make all to end - and re-creates. the light of lights he is, in the heart of the dark shining eternally. wisdom he is and wisdom way, and guide of all the wise, planted in every heart. so have i told of life's stuff, and the moulding, and the lore to comprehend. whoso, adoring me, perceiveth this, shall surely come to me! know you that nature and the spirit both have no beginning! know that qualities and changes of them are by nature wrought; that nature puts to work the acting frame, but spirit doth inform it, and so cause feeling of pain and pleasure. spirit, linked to moulded matter, entereth into bond with qualities by nature framed, and, thus married to matter, breeds the birth again in good or evil yonis. yet is this yea! in its bodily prison!--spirit pure, spirit supreme; surveying, governing, guarding, possessing; lord and master still purusha, ultimate, one soul with me. whoso thus knows himself, and knows his soul purusha, working through the qualities with nature modes, the light hath come for him! whatever flesh he bears, never again shall he take on its load. some few there be by meditation find the soul in self self-schooled; and some by long philosophy and holy life reach thither; some by works: some, never so attaining, hear of light from other lips, and seize, and cleave to it worshipping; yea! and those - to teaching true - overpass death! wherever, indian prince! life is - of moving things, or things unmoved, plant or still seed - know, what is there hath grown by bond of matter and of spirit: know he sees indeed who sees in all alike the living, lordly soul; the soul supreme, imperishable amid the perishing: for, whoso thus beholds, in every place, in every form, the same, one, living life, doth no more wrongfulness unto himself, but goes the highest road which brings to bliss. seeing, he sees, indeed, who sees that works are nature wont, for soul to practhis ise by acting, yet not the agent; sees the mass of separate living things - each of its kind - issue from one, and blend again to one: then hath he brahmaa, he attains! o prince! that ultimate, high spirit, uncreate, unqualified, even when it entereth flesh taketh no stain of acts, worketh in nought! like to th\" ethereal air, pervading all, which, for sheer subtlety, avoideth taint, the subtle soul sits everywhere, unstained: like to the light of the all-piercing sun [which is not changed by aught it shines upon,] the soul light shineth pure in every place; and they who, by such eye of wisdom, see how matter, and what deals with it, divide; and how the spirit and the flesh have strife, those wise ones go the way which leads to life! here ends chapter xiii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"kshetrakshetrajnavibhagayog,\" or \"the book of religion by separation of matter and spirit.\" chapter xiv krishna. yet farther will i open unto you this wisdom of all wisdoms, uttermost, the which possessing, all my saints have passed to perfectness. on such high verities reliant, rising into fellowship with me, they are not born again at birth of kalpas, nor at pralyas suffer change! this universe the womb is where i plant seed of all lives! thence, prince of india, comes birth to all beings! whoso, arjuna! mothers each mortal form, brahmaa conceives, and i am he that fathers, sending seed! sattwan, rajas, and tamas, so are named the qualities of nature, \"soothfastness,\" \"passion,\" and \"ignorance.\" these three bind down the changeless spirit in the changeful flesh. whereof sweet \"soothfastness,\" by purity living unsullied and enlightened, binds the sinless soul to happiness and truth; and passion, being kin to appetite, and breeding impulse and propensity, binds the embodied soul, o arjuna! by tie of works. but ignorance, begot of darkness, blinding mortal men, binds down their souls to stupor, sloth, and drowsiness. yea, prince of india! soothfastness binds souls in pleasant wise to flesh; and passion binds by toilsome strain; but ignorance, which blots the beams of wisdom, binds the soul to sloth. passion and ignorance, once overcome, leave soothfastness, o bharata! where this with ignorance are absent, passion rules; and ignorance in hearts not good nor quick. when at all gateways of the body shines the lamp of knowledge, then may one see well soothfastness settled in that city reigns; where longing is, and ardour, and unrest, impulse to strive and gain, and avarice, those spring from passion - prince!--engrained; and where darkness and dulness, sloth and stupor are, ‚this is ignorance hath caused them, kuru chief! moreover, when a soul departeth, fixed in soothfastness, it goeth to the place - perfect and pure - of those that know all truth. if it departeth in set habitude of impulse, it shall pass into the world of spirits tied to works; and, if it dies in hardened ignorance, that blinded soul is born anew in some unlighted womb. the fruit of soothfastness is true and sweet; the fruit of lusts is pain and toil; the fruit of ignorance is deeper darkness. yea! for light brings light, and passion ache to have; and gloom, bewilderments, and ignorance grow forth from ignorance. those of the first rise ever higher; those of the second mode take a mid place; the darkened souls sink back to lower deeps, loaded with witlessness! when, watching life, the living man perceives the only actors are the qualities, and knows what rules beyond the qualities, then is he come nigh unto me! the soul, thus passing forth from the three qualities - whereby arise all bodies - overcomes birth, death, sorrow, and age; and drinketh deep the undying wine of amrit. arjuna. oh, my lord! which be the signs to know him that hath gone past the three modes? how liveth he? what way leadeth him safe beyond the threefold modes? krishna. he who with equanimity surveys lustre of goodness, strife of passion, sloth of ignorance, not angry if they are, not wishful when they are not: he who sits a sojourner and stranger in their midst unruffled, standing off, saying - serene - when troubles break, \"these be the qualities!\" he unto whom - self-centred - grief and joy sound as one word; to whose deep-seeing eyes the clod, the marble, and the gold are one; whose equal heart holds the same gentleness for lovely and unlovely things, firm-set, well-pleased in praise and dispraise; sathis isfied with honour or dishonour; unto friends and unto foes alike in tolerance; detached from undertakings,--he is named surmounter of the qualities! and such - with single, fervent faith adoring me, passing beyond the qualities, conforms to brahmaa, and attains me! for i am that whereof brahmaa is the likeness! mine the amrit is; and immortality is mine; and mine perfect felicity! here ends chapter xiv. of the bhagavad-gita entitled \"gunatrayavibhagayog,\" or \"the book of religion by separation from the qualities.\" chapter xv krishna. men call the aswattha,--the banyan-tree,-- which hath its boughs beneath, its roots above,-- the ever-holy tree. yea! for its leaves are green and waving hymns which whisper truth! who knows the aswattha, knows veds, and all. its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth, even as the deeds of men, which take their birth from qualities: its silver sprays and blooms, and all the eager verdure of its girth, leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air, as men's lives quicken to the temptings fair of wooing sense: its hanging rootlets seek the soil beneath, helping to hold it there, as actions wrought amid this world of men bind them by ever-tightening bonds again. if ye knew well the teaching of the tree, what its shape said; and whence it springs; and, then how it must end, and all the ills of it, the axe of sharp detachment ye would whet, and cleave the clinging snaky roots, and lay this aswattha of sense-life low,--to set new growths upspringing to that happier sky,-- which they who reach shall have no day to die, nor fade away, nor fall - to him, i mean, father and first, who made the mystery of old creation; for to him come they from passion and from dreams who break away; who part the bonds constraining them to flesh, and,--him, the highest, worshipping alway - no longer grow at mercy of what breeze of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees, what blast of tempest tears them, bough and stem to the eternal world pass such as these! another sun gleams there! another moon! another light,--not dusk, nor dawn, nor noon - which they who once behold return no more; they have attained my rest, life's utmost boon! when, in this world of manifested life, the undying spirit, setting forth from me, taketh on form, it draweth to itself from being's storehouse,--which containeth all,-- senses and intellect. the sovereign soul thus entering the flesh, or quitting it, gathers these up, as the wind gathers scents, blowing above the flower-beds. ear and eye, and touch and taste, and smelling, these it takes,-- yea, and a sentient mind;--linking itself to sense-things so. the unenlightened ones mark not that spirit when he goes or comes, nor when he takes his pleasure in the form, conjoined with qualities; but those see plain who have the eyes to see. holy souls see which strive thereto. enlightened, they perceive that spirit in themselves; but foolish ones, even yough they strive, discern not, having hearts unkindled, ill-informed! know, too, from me shineth the gathered glory of the suns which lighten all the world: from me the moons draw silvery beams, and fire fierce loveliness. i penetrate the clay, and lend all shapes their living force; i glide into the plant - root, leaf, and bloom - to make the woodlands green with springing sap. becoming vital warmth, i glow in glad, respiring frames, and pass, with outward and with inward breath, to feed the body by all meats. for in this world being is twofold: the divided, one; the undivided, one. all things that live are \"the divided.\" that which sits apart, \"the undivided.\" higher still is he, the highest, holding all, whose name is lord, the eternal, sovereign, first! who fills all worlds, sustaining them. and - dwelling thus beyond divided being and undivided - i am called of men and vedas, life supreme, the purushottama. who knows me thus, with mind unclouded, know all, dear prince! and with his whole soul ever worshippeth me. now is the sacred, secret mystery declared to you! who comprehendeth this hath wisdom! he is quit of works in bliss! here ends chapter xv. of the bhagavad-gita entitled \"purushottamapraptiyog,\" or \"the book of religion by attaining the supreme.\" chapter xvi krishna. fearlessness, singleness of soul, the will always to strive for wisdom; opened hand and governed appetites; and piety, and love of lonely study; humbleness, uprightness, heed to injure nought which lives, truthfulness, slowness unto wrath, a mind that lightly letteth go what others prize; and equanimity, and charity which spieth no man faults; and tenderness towards all that suffer; a contented heart, fluttered by no desires; a bearing mild, modest, and grave, with manhood nobly mixed, with patience, fortitude, and purity; an unrevengeful spirit, never given to rate itself too high;--such be the signs, o indian prince! of him whose feet are set on that fair path which leads to heavenly birth! deceitfulness, and arrogance, and pride, quickness to anger, harsh and evil speech, and ignorance, to its own darkness blind,-- these be the signs, my prince! of him whose birth is fated for the regions of the vile. the heavenly birth brings to deliverance, so should you know! the birth with asuras brings into bondage. be you joyous, prince! whose lot is set apart for heavenly birth. two stamps there are marked on all living men, divine and undivine; i speak to you by what marks you should know the heavenly man, hear from me now of the unheavenly! they comprehend not, the unheavenly, how souls go forth from me; nor how they come back unto me: nor is there truth in these, nor purity, nor rule of life. \"this world hath not a law, nor order, nor a lord,\" so say they: \"nor hath risen up by cause following on cause, in perfect purposing, but is none other than a house of lust.\" and, this thing thinking, all those ruined ones - of little wit, dark-minded - give themselves to evil deeds, the curses of their kind. surrendered to desires insatiable, full of deceitfulness, folly, and pride, in blindness cleaving to their errors, caught into the sinful course, they trust this lie as it were true - this lie which leads to death - finding in pleasure all the good which is, and crying \"here it finish!\" ensnared in nooses of a hundred idle hopes, slaves to their passion and their wrath, they buy wealth with base deeds, to glut hot appetites; \"thus much, to-day,\" they say, \"we gained! thereby such and such wish of heart shall have its fill; and this is ours! and the other shall be ours! to-day we slew a foe, and we will slay our other enemy to-morrow! look! are we not lords? make we not goodly cheer? is not our fortune famous, brave, and great? rich are we, proudly born! what other men live like to us? kill, then, for sacrifice! cast largesse, and be merry!\" so they speak darkened by ignorance; and so they fall - tossed to and fro with projects, tricked, and bound in net of black delusion, lost in lusts - down to foul naraka. conceited, fond, stubborn and proud, dead-drunken with the wine of wealth, and reckless, all their offerings have but a show of reverence, being not made in piety of ancient faith. thus vowed to self-hood, force, insolence, feasting, wrath, these my blasphemers, in the forms they wear and in the forms they breed, my foemen are, hateful and hating; cruel, evil, vile, lowest and least of men, whom i cast down again, and yet again, at end of lives, into some devilish womb, whence - birth by birth - the devilish wombs re-spawn them, all beguiled; and, till they find and worship me, sweet prince! tread they that nether road. the doors of hell are threefold, whereby men to ruin pass,-- the door of lust, the door of wrath, the door of avarice. let a man shun those three! he who shall turn aside from entering all those three gates of narak, wend straight to find his peace, and comes to swarga gate. . . . . . . . . . . . . here endeth chapter xvi. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"daivasarasaupadwibhagayog,\" or \"the book of the separateness of the divine and undivine.\" chapter xvii arjuna. if men forsake the holy ordinance, heedless of shastras, yet keep faith at heart and worship, what shall be the state of those, great krishna! sattwan, rajas, tamas? say! krishna. threefold the faith is of mankind and springs from those three qualities,--becoming \"true,\" or \"passion-stained,\" or \"dark,\" as you shalt hear! the faith of each believer, indian prince! conforms itself to what he truly is. where you shalt see a worshipper, that one to what he worships lives assimilate, [such as the shrine, so is the votary,] the \"soothfast\" souls adore true gods; the souls obeying rajas worship rakshasas or yakshas; and the men of darkness pray to pretas and to bhutas. yea, and those who practhis ise bitter penance, not enjoined by rightful rule - penance which hath its root in self-sufficient, proud hypocrisies - those men, passion-beset, violent, wild, torturing - the witless ones - my elements shut in fair company within their flesh, (nay, me myself, present within the flesh!) know them to devils devoted, not to heaven! for like as foods are threefold for mankind in nourishing, so is there threefold way of worship, abstinence, and almsgiving! hear this of me! there is a food which brings force, substance, strength, and health, and joy to live, being well-seasoned, cordial, comforting, the \"soothfast\" meat. and there be foods which bring aches and unrests, and burning blood, and grief, being too biting, heating, salt, and sharp, and therefore craved by too strong appetite. and there is foul food - kept from over-night, savourless, filyour, which the foul will eat, a feast of rottenness, meet for the lips of such as love the \"darkness.\" thus with rites;-- a sacrifice not for rewardment made, offered in rightful wise, when he who vows sayeth, with heart devout, \"this i should do!\" is \"soothfast\" rite. but sacrifice for gain, offered for good repute, be sure that this, o best of bharata! is rajas-rite, with stamp of \"passion.\" and a sacrifice offered against the laws, with no due dole of food-giving, with no accompaniment of hallowed hymn, nor largesse to the priests, in faithless celebration, call it vile, the deed of \"darkness!\" - lost! worship of gods meriting worship; lowly reverence of twice-borns, teachers, elders; purity, rectitude, and the brahmaacharya vow, and not to injure any helpless thing,-- these make a true religiousness of act. words causing no man woe, words ever true, gentle and pleasing words, and those ye say in murmured reading of a sacred writ,-- these make the true religiousness of speech. serenity of soul, benignity, sway of the silent spirit, constant stress to sanctify the nature,--these things make good rite, and true religiousness of mind. such threefold faith, in highest piety kept, with no hope of gain, by hearts devote, is perfect work of sattwan, true belief. religion shown in act of proud display to win good entertainment, worship, fame, such - say i - is of rajas, rash and vain. religion followed by a witless will to torture self, or come at power to hurt another,--‚this is of tamas, dark and ill. the gift lovingly given, when one shall say \"now must i gladly give!\" when he who takes can render nothing back; made in due place, due time, and to a meet recipient, is gift of sattwan, fair and profitable. the gift selfishly given, where to receive is hoped again, or when some end is sought, or where the gift is proffered with a grudge, this is of rajas, stained with impulse, ill. the gift churlishly flung, at evil time, in wrongful place, to base recipient, made in disdain or harsh unkindliness, is gift of tamas, dark; it doth not bless! here endeth chapter xvii. of the bhagavad-gita, entitled \"sraddhatrayavibhagayog,\" or \"the book of religion by the threefold kinds of faith.\" chapter xviii arjuna. fain would i better know, you glorious one! the very truth - heart's lord!--of sannyas, abstention; and enunciation, lord! tyaga; and what separates these twain! krishna. the poets rightly teach that sannyas is the foregoing of all acts which spring out of desire; and their wisest say tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts. there be among the saints some who have held all action sinful, and to be renounced; and some who answer, \"nay! the goodly acts - as worship, penance, alms - must be performed!\" hear now my sentence, best of bharata! ‚this is well set forth, o chaser of your foes! renunciation is of threefold form, and worship, penance, alms, not to be stayed; nay, to be gladly done; for all those three are purifying waters for true souls! yet must be practhis ised even those high works in yielding up attachment, and all fruit produced by works. this is my judgment, prince! this my insuperable and fixed decree! abstaining from a work by right prescribed never is meet! so to abstain doth spring from \"darkness,\" and delusion teach it. abstaining from a work grievous to flesh, when one said \"'this isunpleasing!\" this is null! such an one acts from \"passion;\" nought of gain wins his renunciation! but, arjun! abstaining from attachment to the work, abstaining from rewardment in the work, while yet one doeth it full faithfully, saying, \"this is right to do!\" that is \"true \" act and abstinence! who doeth duties so, unvexed if his work fail, if it succeed unflattered, in his own heart justified, quit of debates and doubts, his is \"true\" act: for, being in the body, none may stand wholly aloof from act; yet, who abstains from profit of his acts is abstinent. the fruit of labours, in the lives to come, is threefold for all men,--desirable, and undesirable, and mixed of both; but no fruit is at all where no work was. hear from me, long-armed lord! the makings five which go to every act, in sankhya taught as necessary. first the force; and then the agent; next, the various instruments; fourth, the especial effort; fifth, the god. what work soever any mortal doth of body, mind, or speech, evil or good, by these five doth he that. which being thus, whoso, for lack of knowledge, see himself as the sole actor, know nought at all and see nought. therefore, i say, if one - holding aloof from self - with unstained mind should slay all yonder host, being bid to slay, he doth not slay; he is not bound thereby! knowledge, the thing known, and the mind which knows, these make the threefold starting-ground of act. the act, the actor, and the instrument, these make the threefold total of the deed. but knowledge, agent, act, are differenced by three dividing qualities. hear now which be the qualities dividing them. there is \"true\" knowledge. learn you it is this: to see one changeless life in all the lives, and in the separate, one inseparable. there is imperfect knowledge: that which sees the separate existences apart, and, being separated, holds them real. there is false knowledge: that which blindly clings to one as if ‚twere all, seeking no cause, deprived of light, narrow, and dull, and \"dark.\" there is \"right\" action: that which being enjoined - is wrought wiyout attachment, passionlessly, for duty, not for love, nor hate, nor gain. there is \"vain\" action: that which men pursue aching to sathis isfy desires, impelled by sense of self, with all-absorbing stress: this is of rajas - passionate and vain. there is \"dark\" action: when one doth a thing heedless of issues, heedless of the hurt or wrong for others, heedless if he harm his own soul - ‚this is of tamas, black and bad! there is the \"rightful\"doer. he who acts free from self-seeking, humble, resolute, steadfast, in good or evil hap the same, content to do aright-he \"truly\" acts. there is the \"impassioned\" doer. he that works from impulse, seeking profit, rude and bold to overcome, unchastened; slave by turns of sorrow and of joy: of rajas he! and there be evil doers; loose of heart, low-minded, stubborn, fraudulent, remiss, dull, slow, despondent - children of the \"dark.\" hear, too, of intellect and steadfastness the threefold separation, conqueror-prince! how these are set apart by qualities. good is the intellect which comprehends the coming forth and going back of life, what must be done, and what must not be done, what should be feared, and what should not be feared, what binds and what emancipates the soul: that is of sattwan, prince! of \"soothfastness.\" marred is the intellect which, knowing right and knowing wrong, and what is well to do and what must not be done, yet understands nought with firm mind, nor as the calm truth is: this is of rajas, prince! and \"passionate!\" evil is intellect which, wrapped in gloom, looks upon wrong as right, and sees all things contrariwise of truth. o pritha son! that is of tamas, \"dark\" and desperate! good is the steadfastness whereby a man masters his beats of heart, his very breath of life, the action of his senses; fixed in never-shaken faith and piety: that is of sattwan, prince! \"soothfast\" and fair! stained is the steadfastness whereby a man holds to his duty, purpose, effort, end, for life's sake, and the love of goods to gain, arjuna! ‚this is of rajas, passion-stamped! sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool cleaves to his sloth, his sorrow, and his fears, his folly and despair. this - pritha son!-- is born of tamas, \"dark\" and miserable! hear further, chief of bharata! from me the threefold kinds of pleasure which there be. good pleasure is the pleasure that endures, banishing pain for aye; bitter at first as poison to the soul, but afterward sweet as the taste of amrit. drink of that! it spring in the spirit deep content. and painful pleasure spring from the bond between the senses and the sense-world. sweet as amrit is its first taste, but its last bitter as poison. ‚this is of rajas, prince! and foul and \"dark\" the pleasure is which springs from sloth and sin and foolishness; at first and at the last, and all the way of life the soul bewildering. ‚this is of tamas, prince! for nothing lives on earth, nor ‚midst the gods in utmost heaven, but hath its being bound with these three qualities, by nature framed. the work of brahmaan, kshatriyas, vaisyas, and sudras, o you slayer of your foes! is fixed by reason of the qualities planted in each: a brahmaan virtues, prince! born of his nature, are serenity, self-mastery, religion, purity, patience, uprightness, learning, and to know the truth of things which be. a kshatriya's pride, born of his nature, lives in valour, fire, constancy, skilfulness, spirit in fight, and open-handedness and noble mien, as of a lord of men. a vaisya's task, born with his nature, is to till the ground, tend cattle, venture trade. a sudra's state, suiting his nature, is to minister. whoso perform - diligent, content - the work allotted him, whate'er it be, lays hold of perfectness! hear how a man findeth perfection, being so content: he findeth it through worship - wrought by work - of him that is the source of all which lives, of him by whom the universe was stretched. better yours own work is, yough done with fault, than doing others' work, even excellently. he shall not fall in sin who fronts the task set him by nature hand! let no man leave his natural duty, prince! yough it bear blame! for every work hath blame, as every flame is wrapped in smoke! only that man attains perfect surcease of work whose work was wrought with mind unfettered, soul wholly subdued, desires for ever dead, results renounced. learn from me, son of kunti! also this, how one, attaining perfect peace, attains brahma, the supreme, the highest height of all! devoted - with a heart grown pure, restrained in lordly self-control, forgoing wiles of song and senses, freed from love and hate, dwelling ‚mid solitudes, in diet spare, with body, speech, and will tamed to obey, ever to holy meditation vowed, from passions liberate, quit of the self, of arrogance, impatience, anger, pride; freed from surroundings, quiet, lacking nought - such an one grows to oneness with the brahma; such an one, growing one with brahma, serene, sorrows no more, desires no more; his soul, equally loving all that lives, loves well me, who have made them, and attains to me. by this same love and worship doth he know me as i am, how high and wonderful, and knowing, straightway enters into me. and whatsoever deeds he doeth - fixed in me, as in his refuge - he hath won for ever and for ever by my grace the eternal rest! so win you! in your youghts do all you dost for me! renounce for me! sacrifice heart and mind and will to me! live in the faith of me! in faith of me all dangers you shalt vanquish, by my grace; but, trusting to yourself and heeding not, you can'st but perish! if this day you say, relying on yourself, \"i will not fight!\" vain will the purpose prove! your qualities would spur you to the war. what you dost shun, misled by fair illusions, you wouldst seek against your will, when the task comes to you waking the promptings in your nature set. there lives a master in the hearts of men make their deeds, by subtle pulling - strings, dance to what tune he will. with all your soul trust him, and take him for your succour, prince! so - only so, arjuna!--shalt you gain - by grace of him - the uttermost repose, the eternal place! thus hath been opened you this truth of truths, the mystery more hid than any secret mystery. meditate! and - as you wilt - then act! nay! but once more take my last word, my utmost meaning have! precious you art to me; right well-beloved! listen! i tell you for your comfort this. give me your heart! adore me! serve me! cling in faith and love and reverence to me! so shalt you come to me! i promise true, for you art sweet to me! and let go those - rites and writ duties! fly to me alone! make me your single refuge! i will free your soul from all its sins! be of good cheer! [hide, the holy krishna said, this from him that hath no faith, him that worships not, nor seeks wisdom teaching when she speaks: hide it from all men who mock; but, wherever, ‚mid the flock of my lovers, one shall teach this divinest, wisest, speech - teaching in the faith to bring truth to them, and offering of all honour unto me - unto brahmaa cometh he! nay, and nowhere shall ye find any man of all mankind doing dearer deed for me; nor shall any dearer be in my earth. yea, furthermore, whoso reads this converse o'er, held by us upon the plain, pondering piously and fain, he hath paid me sacrifice!

            " Dhritirashtra ranged thus for battle on the sacred plain  on kurukshetra  say sanjaya. say what wrought my people and the pandavas. sanjaya when he beheld the host of pandavas raja duryodhana to drona drew and speak these words ah guru. see this line how vast it is of pandu fighting men embattled by the son of drupada your scholar in the war. therein stand ranked chiefs like arjuna like to bhima chiefs benders of bows virata yuyudhan drupada eminent upon his car dhrishtaket chekitan kasi stout lord purujit kuntibhoj and saivya with yudhamanyu and uttamauj subhadra child and drupadi all famed. all mounted on their shining chariots. on our side too  you best of brahmaan. see excellent chiefs commanders of my line whose names i joy to count yourself the first then bhishma karna kripa fierce in fight vikarna aswatthaman next to these strong saumadatti with full many more valiant and tried ready this day to die for me their king each with his weapon grasped each skilful in the field. weakest meseems our battle shows where bhishma holds command and bhima fronting him something too strong. have care our captains nigh to bhishma ranks prepare what help they may. now blow my shell. then at the signal of the aged king with blare to wake the blood rolling around like to a lion roar the trumpeter blew the great conch and at the noise of it trumpets and drums cymbals and gongs and horns burst into sudden clamour as the blasts of loosened tempest such the tumult seemed. then might be seen upon their car of gold yoked with white steeds blowing their battle shells krishna the god arjuna at his side krishna with knotted locks blew his great conch carved of the giant bone  arjuna blew indra loud gift bhima the terrible  wolf bellied bhima blew a long reed conch and yudhisthira kunti s blameless son winded a mighty shell  victory voice  and nakula blew shrill upon his conch named the sweet sounding  sahadev on his called gem bedecked  and kasi prince on his. sikhandi on his car dhrishtadyumn virata satyaki the unsubdued drupada with his sons  o lord of earth. long armed subhadra children all blew loud so that the clangour shook their foemen hearts with quaking earth and thundering heaven. then twas beholding dhritirashtra battle set weapons unsheathing bows drawn forth the war instant to break arjun whose ensign badge was hanuman the monkey speak this thing to krishna the divine his charioteer  drive dauntless one. to yonder open ground betwixt the armies i would see more nigh these who will fight with us those we must slay to day in war s arbitrament for sure on bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain obeying dhritirashtra sinful son. thus by arjuna prayed  o bharata. between the hosts that heavenly charioteer drove the bright car reining its milk white steeds where bhishma led and drona and their lords. see. speak he to arjuna  where they stand your kindred of the kurus  and the prince marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house grandsires and sires uncles and brothers and sons cousins and sons in law and nephews mixed with friends and honoured elders some this side some that side ranged and seeing those opposed such kith grown enemies arjuna s heart melted with pity while he uttered this arjuna. krishna. as i behold come here to shed their common blood yon concourse of our kin my members fail my tongue dries in my mouth a shudder thrills my body and my hair bristles with horror from my weak hand slips gandiv the goodly bow a fever burns my skin to parching hardly may i stand the life within me seems to swim and faint nothing do i foresee save woe and wail. it is not good o keshav. nought of good can spring from mutual slaughter. lo i hate triumph and domination wealth and ease thus sadly won. aho. what victory can bring delight govinda. what rich spoils could profit what rule recompense what span of life itself seem sweet bought with such blood. seeing that these stand here ready to die for whose sake life was fair and pleasure pleased and power grew precious grandsires sires and sons brothers and fathers in law and sons in law elders and friends. shall i deal death on these even yough they seek to slay us. not one blow o madhusudan. will i strike to gain the rule of all three worlds then how much less to seize an earthly kingdom. killing these must breed but anguish krishna. if they be guilty we shall grow guilty by their deaths their sins will light on us if we shall slay those sons of dhritirashtra and our kin what peace could come of that o madhava. for if indeed blinded by lust and wrath these cannot see or will not see the sin of kingly lines o erthrown and kinsmen slain how should not we who see shun such a crime  we who perceive the guilt and feel the shame  o you delight of men janardana. by overthrow of houses perisheth their sweet continuous household piety and rites neglected piety extinct  enters impiety upon that home its women grow unwomaned whence there spring mad passions and the mingling up of castes sending a hell ward road that family and whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath. nay and the souls of honoured ancestors fall from their place of peace being bereft of funeral cakes and the wan death water. so teach our holy hymns. thus if we slay kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power ahovat. what an evil fault it were. better i deem it if my kinsmen strike to face them weaponless and bare my breast to shaft and spear than answer blow with blow. so speaking in the face of those two hosts arjuna sank upon his chariot seat and let fall bow and arrows sick at heart. Sanjaya him filled with such compassion and such grief with eyes tear dimmed despondent in stern words the driver madhusudan thus addressed krishna. how hath this weakness taken you. whence springs the inglorious trouble shameful to the brave barring the path of virtue. nay arjun. forbid yourself to feebleness. it mars your warrior name. cast off the coward fit. wake. be yourself. arise scourge of your foes. arjuna. how can i in the battle shoot with shafts on bhishma or on drona o you chief.  both worshipful both honourable men. better to live on beggar s bread with those we love alive than taste their blood in rich feasts spread and guiltily survive. ah. were it worse who knows. to be victor or vanquished here when those confront us angrily whose death leaves living drear. in pity lost by doubtings tossed my youghts distracted turn to you the guide i reverence most that i may counsel learn i know not what would heal the grief burned into soul and sense if i were earthes unchallenged chief  a god  and these gone thence. sanjaya. so speak arjuna to the lord of hearts and sighing i will not fight. held silence then. to whom with tender smile  o bharata.  while the prince wept despairing twixt those hosts krishna made answer in divinest verse krishna. you grievest where no grief should be. you speak words lacking wisdom. for the wise in heart mourn not for those that live nor those that die. nor i nor you nor any one of these ever was not nor ever will not be for ever and for ever afterwards. all that doth live lives always. to man frame as there come infancy and youth and age so come there raisings up and layings down of other and of other life abodes which the wise know and fear not. this that irks  your sense life thrilling to the elements  bringing you heat and cold sorrows and joys  this is brief and mutable. bear with it prince. as the wise bear. the soul which is not moved the soul that with a strong and constant calm takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently lives in the life undying. that which is can never cease to be that which is not will not exist. to see this truth of both is theirs who part essence from accident substance from shadow. indestructible learn you. the life is spreading life through all it cannot anywhere by any means be anywise diminished stayed or changed. but for these fleeting frames which it informs with spirit deathless endless infinite they perish. let them perish prince. and fight. he who shall say  lo. i have slain a man. he who shall think  lo. i am slain. those both know naught. life cannot slay. life is not slain. never the spirit was born the spirit shall cease to be never never was time it was not end and beginning are dreams. birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever death hath not touched it at all dead yough the house of it seems. who know it exhaustless self sustained immortal indestructible  shall such say  i have killed a man or caused to kill. nay but as when one layeth his worn out robes away and taking new ones sayeth  these will i wear to day. so putteth by the spirit lightly its garb of flesh and passeth to inherit a residence afresh. i say to you weapons reach not the life flame burns it not waters cannot overwhelm nor dry winds wither it. impenetrable unentered unassailed unharmed untouched immortal all arriving stable sure invisible ineffable by word and yought uncompassed ever all itself thus is the soul declared. how wilt you then  knowing it so  grieve when you should not grieve. how if you hearest that the man new dead is like the man new born still living man  one same existent spirit  wilt you weep. the end of birth is death the end of death is birth this is ordained. and mournest you chief of the stalwart arm. for what befalls which could not otherwise befall. the birth of living things comes unperceived the death comes unperceived between them beings perceive what is there sorrowful herein dear prince. wonderful wistful to contemplate. difficult doubtful to speak upon. strange and great for tongue to relate mystical hearing for every one. nor wotteth man this what a marvel it is when seeing and saying and hearing are done. this life within all living things my prince. hides beyond harm scorn you to suffer then for that which cannot suffer. do your part. be mindful of your name and tremble not. nought better can betide a martial soul than lawful war happy the warrior to whom comes joy of battle  comes as now glorious and fair unsought opening for him a gateway unto heaven. but if you shunn st this honourable field  a kshattriya  if knowing your duty and your task you biddest duty and task go by  that shall be sin. and those to come shall speak you infamy from age to age but infamy is worse for men of noble blood to bear than death. the chiefs upon their battle chariots will deem twas fear that drove you from the fray. of those who held you mighty souled the scorn you must abide while all yours enemies will scatter bitter speech of you to mock the valour which you hadst what fate could fall more grievously than this. either  being killed  you wilt win swarga safety or  alive and victor  you wilt reign an earthly king. therefore arise you son of kunti. brace yours arm for conflict nerve your heart to meet  as things alike to you  pleasure or pain profit or ruin victory or defeat so minded gird you to the fight for so you shalt not sin. thus far i speak to you as from the sankhya  unspiritually  hear now the deeper teaching of the yog which holding understanding you shalt burst your karmabandh the bondage of wrought deeds. here shall no end be hindered no hope marred no loss be feared faith  yea a little faith  shall save you from the anguish of your dread. here glory of the kurus. shines one rule  one steadfast rule  while shifting souls have laws many and hard. specious but wrongful deem the speech of those ill taught ones who extol the letter of their vedas saying  this is all we have or need  being weak at heart with wants seekers of heaven which comes  they say  as fruit of good deeds done  promising men much profit in new births for works of faith in various rites abounding following whereon large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power albeit who wealth and power do most desire least fixity of soul have such least hold on heavenly meditation. much these teach from veds concerning the three qualities  but you be free of the three qualities  free of the pairs of opposites  and free from that sad righteousness which calculates self ruled arjuna. simple sathis isfied. look. like as when a tank pours water forth to suit all needs so do these brahmaan draw text for all wants from tank of holy writ. but you want not. ask not. find full reward of doing right in right. let right deeds be your motive not the fruit which comes from them. and live in action. labour. make yours acts your piety casting all self aside contemning gain and merit equable in good or evil equability is yog is piety. yet the right act is less far less than the right thinking mind. seek refuge in your soul have there your heaven. scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts. the mind of pure devotion  even here  casts equally aside good deeds and bad passing above them. unto pure devotion devote yourself with perfect meditation comes perfect act and the right hearted rise  more certainly because they seek no gain  forth from the bands of body step by step to highest seats of bliss. when your firm soul hath shaken off those tangled oracles which ignorantly guide then shall it soar to high neglect of what s denied or said this way or that way in doctrinal writ. troubled no longer by the priestly lore safe shall it live and sure steadfastly bent on meditation. this is yog  and peace. arjuna. what is his mark who hath that steadfast heart confirmed in holy meditation. how know we his speech kesava. sits he moves he like other men. krishna. when one o pritha son. abandoning desires which shake the mind  finds in his soul full comfort for his soul he hath attained the yog  that man is such. in sorrows not dejected and in joys not overjoyed dwelling outside the stress of passion fear and anger fixed in calms of lofty contemplation  such an one is muni is the sage the true recluse. he who to none and nowhere overbound by ties of flesh takes evil things and good neither desponding nor exulting such bears wisdom plainest mark. he who shall draw as the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe under its shield his five frail senses back under the spirit buckler from the world which else assails them such an one my prince. hath wisdom mark. things that solicit sense hold off from the self governed nay it comes the appetites of him who lives beyond depart  aroused no more. yet may it chance o son of kunti. that a governed mind shall some time feel the sense storms sweep and wrest strong self control by the roots. let him regain his kingdom. let him conquer this and sit on me intent. that man alone is wise who keeps the mastery of himself. if one ponders on objects of the sense there springs attraction from attraction grows desire desire flames to fierce passion passion breeds recklessness then the memory  all betrayed  lets noble purpose go and saps the mind till purpose mind and man are all undone. but if one deals with objects of the sense not loving and not hating making them serve his free soul which rests serenely lord lo. such a man comes to tranquillity and out of that tranquillity shall rise the end and healing of his earthly pains since the will governed sets the soul at peace. the soul of the ungoverned is not his nor hath he knowledge of himself which lacked how grows serenity. and wanting that whence shall he hope for happiness. the mind that gives itself to follow shows of sense see its helm of wisdom rent away and like a ship in waves of whirlwind drives to wreck and death. only with him great prince. whose senses are not swayed by things of sense  only with him who holds his mastery shows wisdom perfect. what is midnight gloom to unenlightened souls shines wakeful day to his clear gaze what seems as wakeful day is known for night thick night of ignorance to his true seeing eyes. such is the saint. and like the ocean day by day receiving floods from all lands which never overflows its boundary line not leaping and not leaving fed by the rivers but unswelled by those  so is the perfect one. to his soul ocean the world of sense pours streams of witchery they leave him as they find wiyout commotion taking their tribute but remaining sea. yea. whoso shaking off the yoke of flesh lives lord not servant of his lusts set free from pride from passion from the sin of self  toucheth tranquillity. o pritha son. that is the state of brahma. there rests no dread when that last step is reached. live where he will die when he may such passeth from all plaining to blest nirvana with the gods attaining. Arjuna you whom all mortals praise janardana. if meditation be a nobler thing than action wherefore then great kesava. dost you impel me to this dreadful fight. now am i by your doubtful speech disturbed. tell me one thing and tell me certainly by what road shall i find the better end. krishna. i told you blameless lord. there be two paths shown to this world two schools of wisdom. first the sankhya which doth save in way of works prescribed by reason next the yog which bids attain by meditation spiritually yet these are one. no man shall scape from act by shunning action nay and none shall come by mere renouncements unto perfectness. nay and no jot of time at any time rests any actionless his nature law compels him even unwilling into act  for yought is act in fancy . he who sits suppressing all the instruments of flesh yet in his idle heart thinking on them plays the inept and guilty hypocrite but he who with strong body serving mind gives up his mortal powers to woryour work not seeking gain arjuna. such an one is honourable. do yours allotted task. work is more excellent than idleness the body life proceeds not lacking work. there is a task of holiness to do unlike world binding toil which bind not the faithful soul such earthly duty do free from desire and you shalt well perform your heavenly purpose. speak prajapati  in the beginning when all men were made and with mankind the sacrifice  do this. work. sacrifice. increase and multiply with sacrifice. this shall be kamaduk your cow of plenty  giving back her milk of all abundance. worship the gods thereby the gods shall yield you grace. those meats ye crave the gods will grant to labour when it pays tithes in the altar flame. but if one eats fruits of the earth rendering to kindly heaven no gift of toil that thief steals from his world. who eat of food after their sacrifice are quit of fault but they that spread a feast all for themselves eat sin and drink of sin. by food the living live food comes of rain and rain comes by the pious sacrifice and sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil thus action is of brahmaa who is one the only all pervading at all times present in sacrifice. he that abstains to help the rolling wheels of this great world glutting his idle sense lives a lost life shameful and vain. existing for himself self concentrated serving self alone no part hath he in aught nothing achieved nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him no hope of help for all the living things of earth depends from him. therefore your task prescribed with spirit unattached gladly perform since in performance of plain duty man mounts to his highest bliss. by works alone janak and ancient saints reached blessedness. moreover for the upholding of your kind action you should embrace. what the wise choose the unwise people take what best men do the multitude will follow. look on me you son of pritha. in the three wide worlds i am not bound to any toil no height awaits to scale no gift remains to gain yet i act here. and if i acted not  earnest and watchful  those that look to me for guidance sinking back to sloth again because i slumbered would decline from good and i should break earthes order and commit her offspring unto ruin bharata. even as the unknowing toil wedded to sense so let the enlightened toil sense freed but set to bring the world deliverance and its bliss not sowing in those simple busy hearts seed of despair. yea. let each play his part in all he finds to do with unyoked soul. all things are everywhere by nature wrought in interaction of the qualities. the fool cheated by self thinks  this i did and that i wrought  but  ah you strong armed prince.  a better lessoned mind knowing the play of visible things within the world of sense and how the qualities must qualify stand aloof even from his acts. the untaught live mixed with them knowing not nature way of highest aims unwitting slow and dull. those make you not to stumble having the light but all your dues discharging for my sake with meditation centred inwardly seeking no profit sathis isfied serene heedless of issue  fight. they who shall keep my ordinance thus the wise and willing hearts have quittance from all issue of their acts but those who disregard my ordinance thinking they know know nought and fall to loss confused and foolish. sooth the instructed one doth of his kind following what fits him most and lower creatures of their kind in vain contending gainst the law. needs must it be the objects of the sense will stir the sense to like and dislike yet the enlightened man yields not to these knowing them enemies. finally this is better that one do his own task as he may even yough he fail than take tasks not his own yough they seem good. to die performing duty is no ill but who seeks other roads shall wander still. arjuna. yet tell me teacher. by what force doth man go to his ill unwilling as if one pushed him that evil path. krishna. kama it is. passion it is. born of the darknesses which pusheth him. mighty of appetite sinful and strong is this. man enemy. as smoke blots the white fire as clinging rust mars the bright mirror as the womb surrounds the babe unborn so is the world of things foiled soiled enclosed in this desire of flesh. the wise fall caught in it the unresting foe it is of wisdom wearing countless forms fair but deceitful subtle as a flame. sense mind and reason  these o arjuna. are booty for it in its play with these it maddens man beguiling blinding him. therefore you noblest child of bharata. govern your heart. constrain the entangled sense. resist the false soft sinfulness which saps knowledge and judgment. yea the world is strong but what discerns it stronger and the mind strongest and high o er all the ruling soul. wherefore perceiving him who reigns supreme put forth full force of soul in your own soul. fight. vanquish foes and doubts dear hero. slay what haunts you in fond shapes and would betray. Krishna this deathless yoga this deep union i taught vivaswata the lord of light vivaswata to manu gave it he to ikshwaku so passed it down the line of all my royal rishis. then with years the truth grew dim and perished noble prince. now once again to you it is declared  this ancient lore this mystery supreme  seeing i find you votary and friend. arjuna. your birth dear lord was in these later days and bright vivaswata preceded time. how shall i comprehend this thing you sayest  from the beginning it was i who taught. krishna. manifold the renewals of my birth have been arjuna. and of your births too. but mine i know and yours you knowest not o slayer of your foes. albeit i be unborn undying indestructible the lord of all things living not the less  by maya by my magic which i stamp on floating nature forms the primal vast  i come and go and come. when righteousness declines o bharata. when wickedness is strong i rise from age to age and take visible shape and move a man with men succouring the good thrusting the evil back and setting virtue on her seat again. who knows the truth touching my births on earth and my divine work when he quits the flesh puts on its load no more falls no more down to earthly birth to me he comes dear prince. many there be who come. from fear set free from anger from desire keeping their hearts fixed upon me  my faithful  purified by sacred flame of knowledge. such as these mix with my being. whoso worship me them i exalt but all men everywhere shall fall into my path albeit those souls which seek reward for works make sacrifice now to the lower gods. i say to you here have they their reward. but i am he made the four castes and portioned them a place after their qualities and gifts. yea i created the reposeful i that live immortally made all those mortal births for works soil not my essence being works wrought uninvolved. who knows me acting thus unchained by action action binds not him and so perceiving all those saints of old worked seeking for deliverance. work you as in the days gone by your fathers did. you sayst perplexed it hath been asked before by singers and by sages  what is act and what inaction. i will teach you this and knowing you shalt learn which work doth save needs must one rightly meditate those three  doing  not doing  and undoing. here thorny and dark the path is. he who sees how action may be rest rest action  he is wisest mid his kind he hath the truth. he doeth well acting or resting. freed in all his works from prickings of desire burned clean in act by the white fire of truth the wise call that man wise and such an one renouncing fruit of deeds always content. always self sathis isfying if he works doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul which  quit of fear and hope  subduing self  rejecting outward impulse  yielding up to body need nothing save body dwells sinless amid all sin with equal calm taking what may befall by grief unmoved unmoved by joy unenvyingly the same in good and evil fortunes nowise bound by bond of deeds. nay but of such an one whose crave is gone whose soul is liberate whose heart is set on truth  of such an one what work he does is work of sacrifice which passeth purely into ash and smoke consumed upon the altar. all is then god. the sacrifice is brahma the ghee and grain are brahma the fire is brahma the flesh it eats is brahma and unto brahma attaineth he who in such office meditates on brahma. some votaries there be who serve the gods with flesh and altar smoke but other some who lighting subtler fires make purer rite with will of worship. of the which be they who in white flame of continence consume joys of the sense delights of eye and ear forgoing tender speech and sound of song and they who kindling fires with torch of truth burn on a hidden altar stone the bliss of youth and love renouncing happiness and they who lay for offering there their wealth their penance meditation piety their steadfast reading of the scrolls their lore painfully gained with long austerities and they who making silent sacrifice draw in their breath to feed the flame of yought and breathe it forth to waft the heart on high governing the ventage of each entering air lest one sigh pass which help not the soul and they who day by day denying needs lay life itself upon the altar flame burning the body wan. lo. all these keep the rite of offering as if they slew victims and all thereby efface much sin. yea. and who feed on the immortal food left of such sacrifice to brahmaa pass to the unending. but for him that makes no sacrifice he hath nor part nor lot even in the present world. how should he share another o you glory of your line. in sight of brahmaa all these offerings are spread and are accepted. comprehend that all proceed by act for knowing this you shalt be quit of doubt. the sacrifice which knowledge pays is better than great gifts offered by wealth since gifts worth  o my prince. lies in the mind which gives the will that serves and these are gained by reverence by strong search by humble heed of those who see the truth and teach it. knowing truth your heart no more will ache with error for the truth shall show all things subdued to you as you to me. moreover son of pandu. wert you worst of all wrong doers this fair ship of truth should bear you safe and dry across the sea of your transgressions. as the kindled flame feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash so unto ash arjuna. unto nought the flame of knowledge wastes works dross away. there is no purifier like thereto in all this world and he who seeketh it shall find it  being grown perfect  in himself. believing he receives it when the soul masters itself and cleaves to truth and comes  possessing knowledge  to the higher peace the uttermost repose. but those untaught and those wiyout full faith and those who fear are shent no peace is here or other where no hope nor happiness for whoso doubts. he that being self contained hath vanquished doubt disparting self from service soul from works enlightened and emancipate my prince. works fetter him no more. cut then atwain with sword of wisdom son of bharata. this doubt that binds your heart beats. cleave the bond born of your ignorance. be bold and wise. give yourself to the field with me. arise. Arjuna yet krishna. at the one time you dost laud surcease of works and at another time service through work. of these twain plainly tell which is the better way. krishna. to cease from works is well and to do works in holiness is well and both conduct to bliss supreme but of these twain the better way is his who working piously refraineth not. that is the true renouncer firm and fixed who  seeking nought rejecting nought  dwells proof against the opposites. o valiant prince. in doing such breaks lightly from all deed  this is the new scholar talks as they were two this sankhya and this yoga wise men know who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both. the region of high rest which sankhyans reach yogins attain. who sees these twain as one sees with clear eyes. yet such abstraction chief. is hard to win wiyout much holiness. whoso is fixed in holiness self ruled pure hearted lord of senses and of self lost in the common life of all which lives  a yogayukt  he is a saint who wends straightway to brahma. such an one is not touched by taint of deeds. nought of myself i do. thus will he think who holds the truth of truths  in seeing hearing touching smelling when he eats or goes or breathes slumbers or talks holds fast or loosens opes his eyes or shuts always assured this is the sense world plays with senses. he that acts in yought of brahma detaching end from act with act content the world of sense can no more stain his soul than waters mar the enamelled lotus leaf. with life with heart with mind nay with the help of all five senses  letting selfhood go  yogins toil ever towards their souls release. such votaries renouncing fruit of deeds gain endless peace the unvowed the passion bound seeking a fruit from works are fastened down. the embodied sage withdrawn within his soul at every act sits godlike in the town which hath nine gateways  neither doing aught nor causing any deed. this world s lord makes neither the work nor passion for the work nor lust for fruit of work the man own self pushes to these. the master of this world takes on himself the good or evil deeds of no man  dwelling beyond. mankind errs here by folly darkening knowledge. but for whom that darkness of the soul is chased by light splendid and clear shines manifest the truth as if a sun of wisdom sprang to shed its beams of dawn. him meditating still him seeking with him blended stayed on him the souls illuminated take that road which hath no turning back  their sins flung off by strength of faith. who will may have this light who hath it sees. to him who wisely sees the brahmaan with his scrolls and sanctities the cow the elephant the unclean dog the outcast gorging dog s meat are all one. the world is overcome  aye. even here. by such as fix their faith on unity. the sinless brahmaa dwells in unity and they in brahmaa. be not over glad attaining joy and be not over sad encountering grief but stayed on brahmaa still constant let each abide. the sage whose sou holds off from outer contacts in himself finds bliss to brahmaa joined by piety his spirit tastes eternal peace. the joys springing from sense life are but quickening wombs which breed sure griefs those joys begin and end. the wise mind takes no pleasure arjuna. in such as those. but if a man shall learn even while he lives and bears his body chain to master lust and anger he is blest. he is the yukta he hath happiness contentment light within his life is merged in brahmaa s life he doth nirvana touch. thus go the rishis unto rest who dwell with sins effaced with doubts at end with hearts governed and calm. glad in all good they live nigh to the peace of god and all those live who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath subduing self and senses knowing the soul. the saint who shuts outside his placid soul all touch of sense letting no contact through whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn equal and slow through nostrils still and close that one with organs heart and mind constrained bent on deliverance having put away passion and fear and rage  hath even now obtained deliverance ever and ever freed. yea. for he knows me who am he that heeds the sacrifice and worship god revealed and he who heeds not being lord of worlds lover of all that lives god unrevealed wherein who will shall find surety and shield. Krishna therefore who doeth work rightful to do not seeking gain from work that man o prince. is sanyasi and yogi  both in one and he is neither who lights not the flame of sacrifice nor setteth hand to task. regard as true renouncer him that makes worship by work for who renounceth not works not as yogin. so is that well said  by works the votary doth rise to faith and saintship is the ceasing from all works because the perfect yogin acts  but acts unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds setting result aside. let each man raise the self by soul not trample down his self since soul that is self s friend may grow self s foe. soul is self s friend when self doth rule o er self but self turns enemy if soul own self hates self as not itself. the sovereign soul of him who lives self governed and at peace is centred in itself taking alike pleasure and pain heat cold glory and shame. he is the yogi he is yukta glad with joy of light and truth dwelling apart upon a peak with senses subjugate whereto the clod the rock the glistering gold show all as one. by this sign is he known being of equal grace to comrades friends chance comers strangers lovers enemies aliens and kinsmen loving all alike evil or good. sequestered should he sit steadfastly meditating solitary his youghts controlled his passions laid away quit of belongings. in a fair still spot having his fixed abode  not too much raised nor yet too low  let him abide his goods a cloth a deerskin and the kusa grass. there setting hard his mind upon the one restraining heart and senses silent calm let him accomplish yoga and achieve pureness of soul holding immovable body and neck and head his gaze absorbed upon his nose end rapt from all around tranquil in spirit free of fear intent upon his brahmaacharya vow devout musing on me lost in the yought of me. that yojin so devoted so controlled comes to the peace beyond  my peace the peace of high nirvana. but for earthly needs religion is not his who too much fasts or too much feasts nor his who sleeps away an idle mind nor his who wears to waste his strength in vigils. nay arjuna. call that the true piety which most removes earth aches and ills where one is moderate in eating and in resting and in sport measured in wish and act sleeping betimes waking betimes for duty. when the man so living centres on his soul the yought straitly restrained  untouched internally by stress of sense  then is he yukta. see. steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind such is the likeness of the yogi s mind shut from sense storms and burning bright to heaven. when mind broods placid soothed with holy wont when self contemplates self and in itself hath comfort when it knows the nameless joy beyond all scope of sense revealed to soul  only to soul. and knowing wavers not true to the farther truth when holding this it deems no other treasure comparable but harboured there cannot be stirred or shook by any gravest grief call that state peace  that happy severance yoga call that man the perfect yogin. steadfastly the will must toil thereto till efforts end in ease and yought has passed from thinking. shaking off all longings bred by dreams of fame and gain shutting the doorways of the senses close with watchful ward so step by step it comes to gift of peace assured and heart assuaged when the mind dwells self wrapped and the soul broods cumberless. but as often as the heart breaks  wild and wavering  from control so oft let him re curb it let him rein it back to the soul governance for perfect bliss grows only in the bosom tranquillised the spirit passionless purged from offence vowed to the infinite. he who thus vows his soul to the supreme soul quitting sin passes unhindered to the endless bliss of unity with brahmaa. he so vowed so blended sees the life soul resident in all things living and all living things in that life soul contained. and whoso thus discerneth me in all and all in me i never let him go nor looseneth he hold upon me but dwell he where he may whate er his life in me he dwells and lives because he knows and worships me who dwell in all which lives and cleaves to me in all. arjuna. if a man sees everywhere  taught by his own similitude  one life one essence in the evil and the good hold him a yogi yea. well perfected. arjuna. slayer of madhu. yet again this yog this peace derived from equanimity made known by you  i see no fixity therein no rest because the heart of men is unfixed krishna. rash tumultuous wilful and strong. it were all one i think to hold the wayward wind as tame man heart. krishna. hero long armed. beyond denial hard man heart is to restrain and wavering yet may it grow restrained by habit prince. by wont of self command. this yog i say cometh not lightly to the ungoverned ones but he who will be master of himself shall win it if he stoutly strive thereto. arjuna. and what road goeth he who having faith fails krishna. in the striving falling back from holiness missing the perfect rule. is he not lost straying from brahmaa s light like the vain cloud which floats twixt earth and heaven when lightning splits it and it vanisheth. fain would i hear you answer me herein since krishna. none save you can clear the doubt. krishna. he is not lost you son of pritha. no. nor earth nor heaven is forfeit even for him because no heart that holds one right desire treadeth the road of loss. he who should fail desiring righteousness cometh at death unto the region of the just dwells there measureless years and being born anew beginneth life again in some fair home amid the mild and happy. it may chance he doth descend into a yogin house on virtue s breast but that is rare. such birth is hard to be obtained on this earth chief. so hath he back again what heights of heart he did achieve and so he strives anew to perfectness with better hope dear prince. for by the old desire he is drawn on unwittingly and only to desire the purity of yog is to pass beyond the sabdabrahma the spoken ved. but being yogi striving strong and long purged from transgressions perfected by births following on births he plants his feet at last upon the farther path. such as one ranks above ascetics higher than the wise beyond achievers of vast deeds. be you yogi arjuna. and of such believe truest and best is he who worships me with inmost soul stayed on my mystery. Krishna learn now dear prince. how if your soul be set ever on me  still exercising yog still making me your refuge  you shalt come most surely unto perfect hold of me. i will declare to you that utmost lore whole and particular which when you knowest leaveth no more to know here in this world. of many yousand mortals one perchance striveth for truth and of those few that strive  nay and rise high  one only  here and there  know me as i am the very truth. earth water flame air ether life and mind and individuality  those eight make up the showing of me manifest. these be my lower nature learn the higher whereby you valiant one. this universe is by its principle of life produced whereby the worlds of visible things are born as from a yoni. know. i am that womb i make and i unmake this universe than me there is no other master prince. no other maker. all these hang on me as hangs a row of pearls upon its string. i am the fresh taste of the water i the silver of the moon the gold o the sun the word of worship in the veds the thrill that passeth in the ether and the strength of man shed seed. i am the good sweet smell of the moistened earth i am the fire s red light the vital air moving in all which moves the holiness of hallowed souls the root undying whence hath sprung whatever is the wisdom of the wise the intellect of the informed the greatness of the great. the splendour of the splendid. arjuna. these am i free from passion and desire yet am i right desire in all who yearn chief of the bharata. for all those moods soothfast or passionate or ignorant which nature frames deduce from me but all are merged in me  not i in them. the world  deceived by those three qualities of being  wotteth not me who am outside them all above them all eternal. hard it is to pierce that veil divine of various shows which hideth me yet they who worship me pierce it and pass beyond. i am not known to evil doers nor to foolish ones nor to the base and churlish nor to those whose mind is cheated by the show of things nor those that take the way of asuras. four sorts of mortals know me he who weeps arjuna. and the man who yearns to know and he who toils to help and he who sits certain of me enlightened. of these four o prince of india. highest nearest best that last is the devout soul wise intent upon the one. dear above all am i to him and he is dearest unto me. all four are good and seek me but mine own the true of heart the faithful  stayed on me taking me as their utmost blessedness they are not mine but i  even i myself. at end of many births to me they come. yet hard the wise mahatma is to find that man who sayeth  all is vasudev. there be those too whose knowledge turned aside by this desire or that gives them to serve some lower gods with various rites constrained by that which mouldeth them. unto all such  worship what shrine they will what shapes in faith  this is i who give them faith. i am content. the heart thus asking favour from its god darkened but ardent hath the end it craves the lesser blessing  but this is i who give. yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap those men of little minds who worship so go where they worship passing with their gods. but mine come unto me. blind are the eyes which deem the unmanifested manifest not comprehending me in my true self. imperishable viewless undeclared hidden behind my magic veil of shows i am not seen by all i am not known  unborn and changeless  to the idle world. but i arjuna. know all things which were and all which are and all which are to be albeit not one among them know me. by passion for the pairs of opposites  by those twain snares of like and dislike prince. all creatures live bewildered save some few who quit of sins holy in act informed freed from the opposites and fixed in faith cleave unto me. who cleave who seek in me refuge from birth and death those have the truth. those know me brahmaa know me soul of souls the adhyatman know karma my work know i am adhibhuta lord of life and adhidaiva lord of all the gods and adhiyajna lord of sacrifice worship me well with hearts of love and faith and find and hold me in the hour of death. Arjuna who is that brahmaa. what that soul of souls the adhyatman. what you best of all. your work the karma. tell me what it is you namest adhibhuta. what again means adhidaiva. yea and how it comes you canst be adhiyajna in your flesh. slayer of madhu. further make me know how good men find you in the hour of death. krishna. i brahmaa am. the one eternal god and adhyatman is my being s name the soul of souls. what goeth forth from me causing all life to live is karma called and manifested in divided forms i am the adhibhuta lord of lives and adhidaiva lord of all the gods because i am purusha who begets. and adhiyajna lord of sacrifice i  speaking with you in this body here  am you embodied one. for all the shrines flame unto me. and at the hour of death he that hath meditated me alone in putting off his flesh comes forth to me enters into my being  doubt you not. but if he meditated otherwise at hour of death in putting off the flesh he goes to what he looked for arjuna. because the soul is fashioned to its like. have me then in your heart always. and fight. you too when heart and mind are fixed on me shalt surely come to me. all come who cleave with never wavering will of firmest faith owning none other gods all come to me the uttermost purusha holiest. whoso hath known me lord of sage and singer ancient of days of all the three worlds stay boundless  but unto every atom bringer of that which quickens it whoso i say hath known my form which passeth mortal knowing seen my effulgence  which no eye hath seen  than the sun s burning gold more brightly glowing dispersing darkness  unto him hath been right life. and in the hour when life is ending with mind set fast and trustful piety drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending in happy peace that faithful one doth die  in glad peace passeth to purusha s heaven. the place which they who read the vedas name aksharam  ultimate  whereto have striven saints and ascetics  their road is the same. that way  the highest way  goes he who shuts the gates of all his senses locks desire safe in his heart centres the vital airs upon his parting yought steadfastly set and murmuring om the sacred syllable  emblem of brahma  dies meditating me. for who none other gods regarding looks ever to me easily am i gained by such a yogi and attaining me they fall not  those mahatmas  back to birth to life which is the place of pain which ends but take the way of utmost blessedness. the worlds arjuna. even brahmaa s world  roll back again from death to life s unrest but they o arjuna. that reach to me taste birth no more. if ye know brahmaa s day which is a yousand yugas if ye know the yousand yugas making brahmaa s night then know ye day and night as he doth know. when that vast dawn doth break the invisible is brought anew into the visible when that deep night doth darken all which is fades back again to him who sent it forth yea. this vast company of living things  again and yet again produced  expires at brahmaa s nightfall and at brahmaa s dawn riseth wiyout its will to life new born. but  higher deeper innermost  abides another life not like the life of sense escaping sight unchanging. this endures when all created things have passed away this is that life named the unmanifest the infinite. the all. the uttermost. thither arriving none return. that life is mine and i am there. and prince. by faith which wanders not there is a way to come thither. i the purusha i who spread the universe around me  in whom dwell all living things  may so be reached and seen. . . . . . . . richer than holy fruit on vedas growing greater than gifts better than prayer or fast such wisdom is. the yogi this way knowing comes to the utmost perfect peace at last. Krishna now will i open unto you  whose heart rejects not  that last lore deepest concealed that farthest secret of my heavens and earths which but to know shall set you free from ills  a royal lore. a kingly mystery. yea. for the soul such light as purgeth it from every sin a light of holiness with inmost splendour shining plain to see easy to walk by inexhaustible. they that receive not this failing in faith to grasp the greater wisdom reach not me destroyer of your foes. they sink anew into the realm of flesh where all things change. by me the whole vast universe of things is spread abroad  by me the unmanifest. in me are all existences contained not i in them. yet they are not contained those visible things. receive and strive to embrace the mystery majestical. my being  creating all sustaining all  still dwells outside of all. see. as the shoreless airs move in the measureless space but are not space  and space were space wiyout the moving airs  so all things are in me but are not i. at closing of each kalpa indian prince. all things which be back to my being come at the beginning of each kalpa all issue new born from me. by energy and help of prakriti my outer self again and yet again i make go forth the realms of visible things  wiyout their will  all of them  by the power of prakriti. yet these great makings prince. involve me not enchain me not. i sit apart from them other and higher and free nowise attached. thus doth the stuff of worlds moulded by me bring forth all that which is moving or still living or lifeless. thus the worlds go on. the minds untaught mistake me veiled in form  naught see they of my secret presence nought of my hid nature ruling all which lives. vain hopes pursuing vain deeds doing fed on vainest knowledge senselessly they seek an evil way the way of brutes and fiends. but my mahatmas those of noble soul who tread the path celestial worship me with hearts unwandering  knowing me the source the eternal source of life. unendingly they glorify me seek me keep their vows of reverence and love with changeless faith adoring me. yea and those too adore who offering sacrifice of wakened hearts have sense of one pervading spirit stress one force in every place yough manifold. i am the sacrifice. i am the prayer. i am the funeral cake set for the dead. i am the healing herb. i am the ghee the mantra and

following the threefold scripture and its writ who seeketh such gaineth the fleeting pleasure of joy which comes and goes. i grant them it. but to those blessed ones who worship me turning not otherwhere with minds set fast i bring assurance of full bliss beyond. nay and of hearts which follow other gods in simple faith their prayers arise to me o arjuna. yough they pray wrongfully for i am the receiver and the lord of every sacrifice which these know not rightfully so they fall to earth again. who follow gods go to their gods who vow their souls to pitris go to pitris minds to evil

Arjuna lord. of the men who serve you  true in heart  as god revealed and of the men who serve worshipping you unrevealed unbodied far which take the better way of faith and life. krishna. whoever serve me  as i show myself  constantly true in full devotion fixed those hold i very holy. but who serve  worshipping me the one the invisible the unrevealed unnamed unthinkable uttermost all pervading highest sure  who thus adore me mastering their sense of one set mind to all glad in all good these blessed souls come unto me. yet hard the travail is for such as bend their minds to reach the unmanifest that viewless path shall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh. but whereso any doeth all his deeds renouncing self for me full of me fixed to serve only the highest night and day musing on me  him will i swiftly lift forth from life s ocean of distress and death whose soul clings fast to me. cling you to me. clasp me with heart and mind. so shalt you dwell surely with me on high. but if your yought droops from such height if you be st weak to set body and soul upon me constantly despair not. give me lower service. seek to reach me worshipping with steadfast will and if you canst not worship steadfastly work for me toil in works pleasing to me. for he that laboureth right for love of me shall finally attain. but if in this your faint heart fails bring me your failure. find refuge in me. let fruits of labour go renouncing hope for me with lowliest heart so shalt you come for yough to know is more than diligence yet worship better is than knowing and renouncing better still. near to renunciation  very near  dwelleth eternal peace. who hateth nought of all which lives living himself benign compassionate from arrogance exempt exempt from love of self unchangeable by good or ill patient contented firm in faith mastering himself true to his word seeking me heart and soul vowed unto me  that man i love. who troubleth not his kind and is not troubled by them clear of wrath living too high for gladness grief or fear that man i love. who dwelling quiet eyed stainless serene well balanced unperplexed working with me yet from all works detached that man i love. who fixed in faith on me dotes upon none scorns none rejoices not and grieves not letting good or evil hap light when it will and when it will depart that man i love. who unto friend and foe keeping an equal heart with equal mind bears shame and glory with an equal peace takes heat and cold pleasure and pain abides quit of desires hears praise or calumny in passionless restraint unmoved by each linked by no ties to earth steadfast in me that man i love. but most of all i love those happy ones to whom this is life to live in single fervid faith and love unseeing drinking the blessed amrit of my being. Arjuna now would i hear o gracious kesava. of life which seems and soul beyond which sees and what it is we know or think to know. krishna. yea. son of kunti. for this flesh ye see is kshetra is the field where life disports and that which views and knows it is the soul kshetrajna. in all fields  you indian prince. i am kshetrajna. i am what surveys. only that knowledge knows which knows the known by the knower. what it is that field of life what qualities it hath and whence it is and why it changeth and the faculty that wotteth it the mightiness of this and how it wotteth hear these things from me. . . . . . . the elements the conscious life the mind the unseen vital force the nine strange gates of the body and the five domains of sense desire dislike pleasure and pain and yought deep woven and persistency of being these all are wrought on matter by the soul. humbleness truthfulness and harmlessness patience and honour reverence for the wise. purity constancy control of self contempt of sense delights self sacrifice perception of the certitude of ill in birth death age disease suffering and sin detachment lightly holding unto home children and wife and all that bind men an ever tranquil heart in fortunes good and fortunes evil with a will set firm to worship me  me only. ceasing not loving all solitudes and shunning noise of foolish crowds endeavours resolute to reach perception of the utmost soul and grace to understand what gain it were so to attain  this is true wisdom prince. and what is otherwise is ignorance. now will i speak of knowledge best to know that truth which giveth man amrit to drink the truth of him the para brahma the all the uncreated  not asat not sat not form nor the unformed yet both and more  whose hands are everywhere and everywhere planted his feet and everywhere his eyes beholding and his ears in every place hearing and all his faces everywhere enlightening and encompassing his worlds. glorified in the senses he hath given yet beyond sense he is sustaining all yet dwells he unattached of forms and modes master yet neither form nor mode hath he he is within all beings  and wiyout  motionless yet still moving not discerned for subtlety of instant presence close to all to each yet measurelessly far. not manifold and yet subsisting still in all which lives for ever to be known as the sustainer yet at the end of times he make all to end  and re creates. the light of lights he is in the heart of the dark shining eternally. wisdom he is and wisdom way and guide of all the wise planted in every heart. so have i told of life s stuff and the moulding and the lore to comprehend. whoso adoring me perceiveth this shall surely come to me. know you that nature and the spirit both have no beginning. know that qualities and changes of them are by nature wrought that nature puts to work the acting frame but spirit doth inform it and so cause feeling of pain and pleasure. spirit linked to moulded matter entereth into bond with qualities by nature framed and thus married to matter breeds the birth again in good or evil yonis. yet is this yea. in its bodily prison. spirit pure spirit supreme surveying governing guarding possessing lord and master still purusha ultimate one soul with me. whoso thus knows himself and knows his soul purusha working through the qualities with nature modes the light hath come for him. whatever flesh he bears never again shall he take on its load. some few there be by meditation find the soul in self self schooled and some by long philosophy and holy life reach thither some by works some never so attaining hear of light from other lips and seize and cleave to it worshipping yea. and those  to teaching true  overpass death. wherever indian prince. life is  of moving things or things unmoved plant or still seed  know what is there hath grown by bond of matter and of spirit know he sees indeed who sees in all alike the living lordly soul the soul supreme imperishable amid the perishing for whoso thus beholds in every place in every form the same one living life doth no more wrongfulness unto himself but goes the highest road which brings to bliss. seeing he sees indeed who sees that works are nature wont for soul to practhis ise by acting yet not the agent sees the mass of separate living things  each of its kind  issue from one and blend again to one then hath he brahmaa he attains. o prince. that ultimate high spirit uncreate unqualified even when it entereth flesh taketh no stain of acts worketh in nought. like to th ethereal air pervading all which for sheer subtlety avoideth taint the subtle soul sits everywhere unstained like to the light of the all piercing sun which is not changed by aught it shines upon  the soul light shineth pure in every place and they who by such eye of wisdom see how matter and what deals with it divide and how the spirit and the flesh have strife those wise ones go the way which leads to life. Krishna yet farther will i open unto you this wisdom of all wisdoms uttermost the which possessing all my saints have passed to perfectness. on such high verities reliant rising into fellowship with me they are not born again at birth of kalpas nor at pralyas suffer change. this universe the womb is where i plant seed of all lives. thence prince of india comes birth to all beings. whoso arjuna. mothers each mortal form brahmaa conceives and i am he that fathers sending seed. sattwan rajas and tamas so are named the qualities of nature  soothfastness  passion  and ignorance. these three bind down the changeless spirit in the changeful flesh. whereof sweet soothfastness  by purity living unsullied and enlightened binds the sinless soul to happiness and truth and passion being kin to appetite and breeding impulse and propensity binds the embodied soul o arjuna. by tie of works. but ignorance begot of darkness blinding mortal men binds down their souls to stupor sloth and drowsiness. yea prince of india. soothfastness binds souls in pleasant wise to flesh and passion binds by toilsome strain but ignorance which blots the beams of wisdom binds the soul to sloth. passion and ignorance once overcome leave soothfastness o bharata. where this with ignorance are absent passion rules and ignorance in hearts not good nor quick. when at all gateways of the body shines the lamp of knowledge then may one see well soothfastness settled in that city reigns where longing is and ardour and unrest impulse to strive and gain and avarice those spring from passion  prince. engrained and where darkness and dulness sloth and stupor are  this is ignorance hath caused them kuru chief. moreover when a soul departeth fixed in soothfastness it goeth to the place  perfect and pure  of those that know all truth. if it departeth in set habitude of impulse it shall pass into the world of spirits tied to works and if it dies in hardened ignorance that blinded soul is born anew in some unlighted womb. the fruit of soothfastness is true and sweet the fruit of lusts is pain and toil the fruit of ignorance is deeper darkness. yea. for light brings light and passion ache to have and gloom bewilderments and ignorance grow forth from ignorance. those of the first rise ever higher those of the second mode take a mid place the darkened souls sink back to lower deeps loaded with witlessness. when watching life the living man perceives the only actors are the qualities and knows what rules beyond the qualities then is he come nigh unto me. the soul thus passing forth from the three qualities  whereby arise all bodies  overcomes birth death sorrow and age and drinketh deep the undying wine of amrit. arjuna. oh my lord. which be the signs to know him that hath gone past the three modes. how liveth he. what way leadeth him safe beyond the threefold modes. krishna. he who with equanimity surveys lustre of goodness strife of passion sloth of ignorance not angry if they are not wishful when they are not he who sits a sojourner and stranger in their midst unruffled standing off saying  serene  when troubles break  these be the qualities. he unto whom  self centred  grief and joy sound as one word to whose deep seeing eyes the clod the marble and the gold are one whose equal heart holds the same gentleness for lovely and unlovely things firm set well pleased in praise and dispraise sathis isfied with honour or dishonour unto friends and unto foes alike in tolerance detached from undertakings  he is named surmounter of the qualities. and such  with single fervent faith adoring me passing beyond the qualities conforms to brahmaa and attains me. for i am that whereof brahmaa is the likeness. mine the amrit is and immortality is mine and mine perfect felicity. Krishna men call the aswattha  the banyan tree  which hath its boughs beneath its roots above  the ever holy tree. yea. for its leaves are green and waving hymns which whisper truth. who knows the aswattha knows veds and all. its branches shoot to heaven and sink to earth even as the deeds of men which take their birth from qualities its silver sprays and blooms and all the eager verdure of its girth leap to quick life at kiss of sun and air as men s lives quicken to the temptings fair of wooing sense its hanging rootlets seek the soil beneath helping to hold it there as actions wrought amid this world of men bind them by ever tightening bonds again. if ye knew well the teaching of the tree what its shape said and whence it springs and then how it must end and all the ills of it the axe of sharp detachment ye would whet and cleave the clinging snaky roots and lay this aswattha of sense life low  to set new growths upspringing to that happier sky  which they who reach shall have no day to die nor fade away nor fall  to him i mean father and first who made the mystery of old creation for to him come they from passion and from dreams who break away who part the bonds constraining them to flesh and  him the highest worshipping alway  no longer grow at mercy of what breeze of summer pleasure stirs the sleeping trees what blast of tempest tears them bough and stem to the eternal world pass such as these. another sun gleams there. another moon. another light  not dusk nor dawn nor noon  which they who once behold return no more they have attained my rest life s utmost boon. when in this world of manifested life the undying spirit setting forth from me taketh on form it draweth to itself from being s storehouse  which containeth all  senses and intellect. the sovereign soul thus entering the flesh or quitting it gathers these up as the wind gathers scents blowing above the flower beds. ear and eye and touch and taste and smelling these it takes  yea and a sentient mind  linking itself to sense things so. the unenlightened ones mark not that spirit when he goes or comes nor when he takes his pleasure in the form conjoined with qualities but those see plain who have the eyes to see. holy souls see which strive thereto. enlightened they perceive that spirit in themselves but foolish ones even yough they strive discern not having hearts unkindled ill informed. know too from me shineth the gathered glory of the suns which lighten all the world from me the moons draw silvery beams and fire fierce loveliness. i penetrate the clay and lend all shapes their living force i glide into the plant  root leaf and bloom  to make the woodlands green with springing sap. becoming vital warmth i glow in glad respiring frames and pass with outward and with inward breath to feed the body by all meats. for in this world being is twofold the divided one the undivided one. all things that live are the divided. that which sits apart  the undivided. higher still is he the highest holding all whose name is lord the eternal sovereign first. who fills all worlds sustaining them. and  dwelling thus beyond divided being and undivided  i am called of men and vedas life supreme the purushottama. who knows me thus with mind unclouded know all dear prince. and with his whole soul ever worshippeth me. now is the sacred secret mystery declared to you. who comprehendeth this hath wisdom. he is quit of works in bliss. Krishna fearlessness singleness of soul the will always to strive for wisdom opened hand and governed appetites and piety and love of lonely study humbleness uprightness heed to injure nought which lives truthfulness slowness unto wrath a mind that lightly letteth go what others prize and equanimity and charity which spieth no man faults and tenderness towards all that suffer a contented heart fluttered by no desires a bearing mild modest and grave with manhood nobly mixed with patience fortitude and purity an unrevengeful spirit never given to rate itself too high  such be the signs o indian prince. of him whose feet are set on that fair path which leads to heavenly birth. deceitfulness and arrogance and pride quickness to anger harsh and evil speech and ignorance to its own darkness blind  these be the signs my prince. of him whose birth is fated for the regions of the vile. the heavenly birth brings to deliverance so should you know. the birth with asuras brings into bondage. be you joyous prince. whose lot is set apart for heavenly birth. two stamps there are marked on all living men divine and undivine i speak to you by what marks you should know the heavenly man hear from me now of the unheavenly. they comprehend not the unheavenly how souls go forth from me nor how they come back unto me nor is there truth in these nor purity nor rule of life. this world hath not a law nor order nor a lord  so say they  nor hath risen up by cause following on cause in perfect purposing but is none other than a house of lust. and this thing thinking all those ruined ones  of little wit dark minded  give themselves to evil deeds the curses of their kind. surrendered to desires insatiable full of deceitfulness folly and pride in blindness cleaving to their errors caught into the sinful course they trust this lie as it were true  this lie which leads to death  finding in pleasure all the good which is and crying here it finish. ensnared in nooses of a hundred idle hopes slaves to their passion and their wrath they buy wealth with base deeds to glut hot appetites  thus much to day  they say  we gained. thereby such and such wish of heart shall have its fill and this is ours. and the other shall be ours. to day we slew a foe and we will slay our other enemy to morrow. look. are we not lords. make we not goodly cheer. is not our fortune famous brave and great. rich are we proudly born. what other men live like to us. kill then for sacrifice. cast largesse and be merry. so they speak darkened by ignorance and so they fall  tossed to and fro with projects tricked and bound in net of black delusion lost in lusts  down to foul naraka. conceited fond stubborn and proud dead drunken with the wine of wealth and reckless all their offerings have but a show of reverence being not made in piety of ancient faith. thus vowed to self hood force insolence feasting wrath these my blasphemers in the forms they wear and in the forms they breed my foemen are hateful and hating cruel evil vile lowest and least of men whom i cast down again and yet again at end of lives into some devilish womb whence  birth by birth  the devilish wombs re spawn them all beguiled and till they find and worship me sweet prince. tread they that nether road. the doors of hell are threefold whereby men to ruin pass  the door of lust the door of wrath the door of avarice. let a man shun those three. he who shall turn aside from entering all those three gates of narak wend straight to find his peace and comes to swarga gate. Arjuna if men forsake the holy ordinance heedless of shastras yet keep faith at heart and worship what shall be the state of those great krishna. sattwan rajas tamas. say. krishna. threefold the faith is of mankind and springs from those three qualities  becoming true  or passion stained  or dark  as you shalt hear. the faith of each believer indian prince. conforms itself to what he truly is. where you shalt see a worshipper that one to what he worships lives assimilate  such as the shrine so is the votary  the soothfast souls adore true gods the souls obeying rajas worship rakshasas or yakshas and the men of darkness pray to pretas and to bhutas. yea and those who practhis ise bitter penance not enjoined by rightful rule  penance which hath its root in self sufficient proud hypocrisies  those men passion beset violent wild torturing  the witless ones  my elements shut in fair company within their flesh  nay me myself present within the flesh. know them to devils devoted not to heaven. for like as foods are threefold for mankind in nourishing so is there threefold way of worship abstinence and almsgiving. hear this of me. there is a food which brings force substance strength and health and joy to live being well seasoned cordial comforting the soothfast meat. and there be foods which bring aches and unrests and burning blood and grief being too biting heating salt and sharp and therefore craved by too strong appetite. and there is foul food  kept from over night savourless filyour which the foul will eat a feast of rottenness meet for the lips of such as love the darkness. thus with rites  a sacrifice not for rewardment made offered in rightful wise when he who vows sayeth with heart devout  this i should do. is soothfast rite. but sacrifice for gain offered for good repute be sure that this o best of bharata. is rajas rite with stamp of passion. and a sacrifice offered against the laws with no due dole of food giving with no accompaniment of hallowed hymn nor largesse to the priests in faithless celebration call it vile the deed of darkness.  lost. worship of gods meriting worship lowly reverence of twice borns teachers elders purity rectitude and the brahmaacharya vow and not to injure any helpless thing  these make a true religiousness of act. words causing no man woe words ever true gentle and pleasing words and those ye say in murmured reading of a sacred writ  these make the true religiousness of speech. serenity of soul benignity sway of the silent spirit constant stress to sanctify the nature  these things make good rite and true religiousness of mind. such threefold faith in highest piety kept with no hope of gain by hearts devote is perfect work of sattwan true belief. religion shown in act of proud display to win good entertainment worship fame such  say i  is of rajas rash and vain. religion followed by a witless will to torture self or come at power to hurt another  this is of tamas dark and ill. the gift lovingly given when one shall say now must i gladly give. when he who takes can render nothing back made in due place due time and to a meet recipient is gift of sattwan fair and profitable. the gift selfishly given where to receive is hoped again or when some end is sought or where the gift is proffered with a grudge this is of rajas stained with impulse ill. the gift churlishly flung at evil time in wrongful place to base recipient made in disdain or harsh unkindliness is gift of tamas dark it doth not bless. Arjuna fain would i better know you glorious one. the very truth  heart s lord. of sannyas abstention and enunciation lord. tyaga and what separates these twain. krishna. the poets rightly teach that sannyas is the foregoing of all acts which spring out of desire and their wisest say tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts. there be among the saints some who have held all action sinful and to be renounced and some who answer  nay. the goodly acts  as worship penance alms  must be performed. hear now my sentence best of bharata. this is well set forth o chaser of your foes. renunciation is of threefold form and worship penance alms not to be stayed nay to be gladly done for all those three are purifying waters for true souls. yet must be practhis ised even those high works in yielding up attachment and all fruit produced by works. this is my judgment prince. this my insuperable and fixed decree. abstaining from a work by right prescribed never is meet. so to abstain doth spring from darkness  and delusion teach it. abstaining from a work grievous to flesh when one said  this isunpleasing. this is null. such an one acts from passion  nought of gain wins his renunciation. but arjun. abstaining from attachment to the work abstaining from rewardment in the work while yet one doeth it full faithfully saying  this is right to do. that is true  act and abstinence. who doeth duties so unvexed if his work fail if it succeed unflattered in his own heart justified quit of debates and doubts his is true act for being in the body none may stand wholly aloof from act yet who abstains from profit of his acts is abstinent. the fruit of labours in the lives to come is threefold for all men  desirable and undesirable and mixed of both but no fruit is at all where no work was. hear from me long armed lord. the makings five which go to every act in sankhya taught as necessary. first the force and then the agent next the various instruments fourth the especial effort fifth the god. what work soever any mortal doth of body mind or speech evil or good by these five doth he that. which being thus whoso for lack of knowledge see himself as the sole actor know nought at all and see nought. therefore i say if one  holding aloof from self  with unstained mind should slay all yonder host being bid to slay he doth not slay he is not bound thereby. knowledge the thing known and the mind which knows these make the threefold starting ground of act. the act the actor and the instrument these make the threefold total of the deed. but knowledge agent act are differenced by three dividing qualities. hear now which be the qualities dividing them. there is true knowledge. learn you it is this to see one changeless life in all the lives and in the separate one inseparable. there is imperfect knowledge that which sees the separate existences apart and being separated holds them real. there is false knowledge that which blindly clings to one as if twere all seeking no cause deprived of light narrow and dull and dark. there is right action that which being enjoined  is wrought wiyout attachment passionlessly for duty not for love nor hate nor gain. there is vain action that which men pursue aching to sathis isfy desires impelled by sense of self with all absorbing stress this is of rajas  passionate and vain. there is dark action when one doth a thing heedless of issues heedless of the hurt or wrong for others heedless if he harm his own soul  this is of tamas black and bad. there is the rightful doer. he who acts free from self seeking humble resolute steadfast in good or evil hap the same content to do aright he truly acts. there is the impassioned doer. he that works from impulse seeking profit rude and bold to overcome unchastened slave by turns of sorrow and of joy of rajas he. and there be evil doers loose of heart low minded stubborn fraudulent remiss dull slow despondent  children of the dark. hear too of intellect and steadfastness the threefold separation conqueror prince. how these are set apart by qualities. good is the intellect which comprehends the coming forth and going back of life what must be done and what must not be done what should be feared and what should not be feared what binds and what emancipates the soul that is of sattwan prince. of soothfastness. marred is the intellect which knowing right and knowing wrong and what is well to do and what must not be done yet understands nought with firm mind nor as the calm truth is this is of rajas prince. and passionate. evil is intellect which wrapped in gloom looks upon wrong as right and sees all things contrariwise of truth. o pritha son. that is of tamas  dark and desperate. good is the steadfastness whereby a man masters his beats of heart his very breath of life the action of his senses fixed in never shaken faith and piety that is of sattwan prince. soothfast and fair. stained is the steadfastness whereby a man holds to his duty purpose effort end for life s sake and the love of goods to gain arjuna. this is of rajas passion stamped. sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool cleaves to his sloth his sorrow and his fears his folly and despair. this  pritha son.  is born of tamas  dark and miserable. hear further chief of bharata. from me the threefold kinds of pleasure which there be. good pleasure is the pleasure that endures banishing pain for aye bitter at first as poison to the soul but afterward sweet as the taste of amrit. drink of that. it spring in the spirit deep content. and painful pleasure spring from the bond between the senses and the sense world. sweet as amrit is its first taste but its last bitter as poison. this is of rajas prince. and foul and dark the pleasure is which springs from sloth and sin and foolishness at first and at the last and all the way of life the soul bewildering. this is of tamas prince. for nothing lives on earth nor midst the gods in utmost heaven but hath its being bound with these three qualities by nature framed. the work of brahmaan kshatriyas vaisyas and sudras o you slayer of your foes. is fixed by reason of the qualities planted in each a brahmaan virtues prince. born of his nature are serenity self mastery religion purity patience uprightness learning and to know the truth of things which be. a kshatriya s pride born of his nature lives in valour fire constancy skilfulness spirit in fight and open handedness and noble mien as of a lord of men. a vaisya s task born with his nature is to till the ground tend cattle venture trade. a sudra s state suiting his nature is to minister. whoso perform  diligent content  the work allotted him whate er it be lays hold of perfectness. hear how a man findeth perfection being so content he findeth it through worship  wrought by work  of him that is the source of all which lives of him by whom the universe was stretched. better yours own work is yough done with fault than doing others work even excellently. he shall not fall in sin who fronts the task set him by nature hand. let no man leave his natural duty prince. yough it bear blame. for every work hath blame as every flame is wrapped in smoke. only that man attains perfect surcease of work whose work was wrought with mind unfettered soul wholly subdued desires for ever dead results renounced. learn from me son of kunti. also this how one attaining perfect peace attains brahma the supreme the highest height of all. devoted  with a heart grown pure restrained in lordly self control forgoing wiles of song and senses freed from love and hate dwelling mid solitudes in diet spare with body speech and will tamed to obey ever to holy meditation vowed from passions liberate quit of the self of arrogance impatience anger pride freed from surroundings quiet lacking nought  such an one grows to oneness with the brahma such an one growing one with brahma serene sorrows no more desires no more his soul equally loving all that lives loves well me who have made them and attains to me. by this same love and worship doth he know me as i am how high and wonderful and knowing straightway enters into me. and whatsoever deeds he doeth  fixed in me as in his refuge  he hath won for ever and for ever by my grace the eternal rest. so win you. in your youghts do all you dost for me. renounce for me. sacrifice heart and mind and will to me. live in the faith of me. in faith of me all dangers you shalt vanquish by my grace but trusting to yourself and heeding not you can st but perish. if this day you say relying on yourself  i will not fight. vain will the purpose prove. your qualities would spur you to the war. what you dost shun misled by fair illusions you wouldst seek against your will when the task comes to you waking the promptings in your nature set. there lives a master in the hearts of men make their deeds by subtle pulling  strings dance to what tune he will. with all your soul trust him and take him for your succour prince. so  only so arjuna. shalt you gain  by grace of him  the uttermost repose the eternal place. thus hath been opened you this truth of truths the mystery more hid than any secret mystery. meditate. and  as you wilt  then act. nay. but once more take my last word my utmost meaning have. precious you art to me right well beloved. listen. i tell you for your comfort this. give me

pandavas raja duryodhana to drona drew and speak these words ah guru. see this line how vast it is of pandu fighting men embattled by the son of drupada your scholar in the war. therein stand ranked chiefs like arjuna like to bhima chiefs benders of bows virata yuyudhan drupada eminent upon his car dhrishtaket chekitan kasi stout lord purujit kuntibhoj and saivya with yudhamanyu and uttamauj subhadra child and drupadi all famed. all mounted on their shining chariots. on our side too  you best of brahmaan. see excellent chiefs commanders of my line whose names i joy to count yourself the first then bhishma karna kripa fierce in fight vikarna aswatthaman next to these strong saumadatti with full many more valiant and tried ready this day to die for me their king each with his weapon grasped each skilful in the field. weakest meseems our battle shows where bhishma holds command and bhima fronting him something too strong. have care our captains nigh to bhishma ranks prepare what help they may. now blow my shell. then at the signal of the aged king with blare to wake the blood rolling around like to a lion roar the trumpeter blew the great conch and at the noise of it trumpets and drums cymbals and gongs and horns burst into sudden clamour as the blasts of loosened tempest such the tumult seemed. then might be seen upon their car of gold yoked with white steeds blowing their battle shells krishna the god arjuna at his side krishna with knotted locks blew his great conch carved of the giant bone  arjuna blew indra loud gift bhima the terrible  wolf bellied bhima blew a long reed conch and yudhisthira kunti s blameless son winded a mighty shell  victory voice  and nakula blew shrill upon his conch named the sweet sounding  sahadev on his called gem bedecked  and kasi prince on his. sikhandi on his car dhrishtadyumn virata satyaki the unsubdued drupada with his sons  o lord of earth. long armed subhadra children all blew loud so that the clangour shook their foemen hearts with quaking earth and thundering heaven. then twas beholding dhritirashtra battle set weapons unsheathing bows drawn forth the war instant to break arjun whose ensign badge was hanuman the monkey speak this thing to krishna the divine his charioteer  drive dauntless one. to yonder open ground betwixt the armies i would see more nigh these who will fight with us those we must slay to day in war s arbitrament for sure on bloodshed all are bent who throng this plain obeying dhritirashtra sinful son. thus by arjuna prayed  o bharata. between the hosts that heavenly charioteer drove the bright car reining its milk white steeds where bhishma led and drona and their lords. see. speak he to arjuna  where they stand your kindred of the kurus  and the prince marked on each hand the kinsmen of his house grandsires and sires uncles and brothers and sons cousins and sons in law and nephews mixed with friends and honoured elders some this side some that side ranged and seeing those opposed such kith grown enemies arjuna s heart melted with pity while he uttered this arjuna. krishna. as i behold come here to shed their common blood yon concourse of our kin my members fail my tongue dries in my mouth a shudder thrills my body and my hair bristles with horror from my weak hand slips gandiv the goodly bow a fever burns my skin to parching hardly may i stand the life within me seems to swim and faint nothing do i foresee save woe and wail. it is not good o keshav. nought of good can spring from mutual slaughter. lo i hate triumph and domination wealth and ease thus sadly won. aho. what victory can bring delight govinda. what rich spoils could profit what rule recompense what span of life itself seem sweet bought with such blood. seeing that these stand here ready to die for whose sake life was fair and pleasure pleased and power grew precious grandsires sires and sons brothers and fathers in law and sons in law elders and friends. shall i deal death on these even yough they seek to slay us. not one blow o madhusudan. will i strike to gain the rule of all three worlds then how much less to seize an earthly kingdom. killing these must breed but anguish krishna. if they be guilty we shall grow guilty by their deaths their sins will light on us if we shall slay those sons of dhritirashtra and our kin what peace could come of that o madhava. for if indeed blinded by lust and wrath these cannot see or will not see the sin of kingly lines o erthrown and kinsmen slain how should not we who see shun such a crime  we who perceive the guilt and feel the shame  o you delight of men janardana. by overthrow of houses perisheth their sweet continuous household piety and rites neglected piety extinct  enters impiety upon that home its women grow unwomaned whence there spring mad passions and the mingling up of castes sending a hell ward road that family and whoso wrought its doom by wicked wrath. nay and the souls of honoured ancestors fall from their place of peace being bereft of funeral cakes and the wan death water. so teach our holy hymns. thus if we slay kinsfolk and friends for love of earthly power ahovat. what an evil fault it were. better i deem it if my kinsmen strike to face them weaponless and bare my breast to shaft and spear than answer blow with blow. so speaking in the face of those two hosts arjuna sank upon his chariot seat and let fall bow and arrows sick at heart. Chapter_two_sanjaya. him filled with such compassion and such grief with eyes tear dimmed despondent in stern words the driver madhusudan thus addressed krishna. how hath this weakness taken you. whence springs the inglorious trouble shameful to the brave barring the path of virtue. nay arjun. forbid yourself to feebleness. it mars your warrior name. cast off the coward fit. wake. be yourself. arise scourge of your foes. arjuna. how can i in the battle shoot with shafts on bhishma or on drona o you chief.  both worshipful both honourable men. better to live on beggar s bread with those we love alive than taste their blood in rich feasts spread and guiltily survive. ah. were it worse who knows. to be victor or vanquished here when those confront us angrily whose death leaves living drear. in pity lost by doubtings tossed my youghts distracted turn to you the guide i reverence most that i may counsel learn i know not what would heal the grief burned into soul and sense if i were earthes unchallenged chief  a god  and these gone thence. sanjaya. so speak arjuna to the lord of hearts and sighing i will not fight. held silence then. to whom with tender smile  o bharata.  while the prince wept despairing twixt those hosts krishna made answer in divinest verse krishna. you grievest where no grief should be. you speak words lacking wisdom. for the wise in heart mourn not for those that live nor those that die. nor i nor you nor any one of these ever was not nor ever will not be for ever and for ever afterwards. all that doth live lives always. to man frame as there come infancy and youth and age so come there raisings up and layings down of other and of other life abodes which the wise know and fear not. this that irks  your sense life thrilling to the elements  bringing you heat and cold sorrows and joys  this is brief and mutable. bear with it prince. as the wise bear. the soul which is not moved the soul that with a strong and constant calm takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently lives in the life undying. that which is can never cease to be that which is not will not exist. to see this truth of both is theirs who part essence from accident substance from shadow. indestructible learn you. the life is spreading life through all it cannot anywhere by any means be anywise diminished stayed or changed. but for these fleeting frames which it informs with spirit deathless endless infinite they perish. let them perish prince. and fight. he who shall say  lo. i have slain a man. he who shall think  lo. i am slain. those both know naught. life cannot slay. life is not slain. never the spirit was born the spirit shall cease to be never never was time it was not end and beginning are dreams. birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for ever death hath not touched it at all dead yough the house of it seems. who know it exhaustless self sustained immortal indestructible  shall such say  i have killed a man or caused to kill. nay but as when one layeth his worn out robes away and taking new ones sayeth  these will i wear to day. so putteth by the spirit lightly its garb of flesh and passeth to inherit a residence afresh. i say to you weapons reach not the life flame burns it not waters cannot overwhelm nor dry winds wither it. impenetrable unentered unassailed unharmed untouched immortal all arriving stable sure invisible ineffable by word and yought uncompassed ever all itself thus is the soul declared. how wilt you then  knowing it so  grieve when you should not grieve. how if you hearest that the man new dead is like the man new born still living man  one same existent spirit  wilt you weep. the end of birth is death the end of death is birth this is ordained. and mournest you chief of the stalwart arm. for what befalls which could not otherwise befall. the birth of living things comes unperceived the death comes unperceived between them beings perceive what is there sorrowful herein dear prince. wonderful wistful to contemplate. difficult doubtful to speak upon. strange and great for tongue to relate mystical hearing for every one. nor wotteth man this what a marvel it is when seeing and saying and hearing are done. this life within all living things my prince. hides beyond harm scorn you to suffer then for that which cannot suffer. do your part. be mindful of your name and tremble not. nought better can betide a martial soul than lawful war happy the warrior to whom comes joy of battle  comes as now glorious and fair unsought opening for him a gateway unto heaven. but if you shunn st this honourable field  a kshattriya  if knowing your duty and your task you biddest duty and task go by  that shall be sin. and those to come shall speak you infamy from age to age but infamy is worse for men of noble blood to bear than death. the chiefs upon their battle chariots will deem twas fear that drove you from the fray. of those who held you mighty souled the scorn you must abide while all yours enemies will scatter bitter speech of you to mock the valour which you hadst what fate could fall more grievously than this. either  being killed  you wilt win swarga safety or  alive and victor  you wilt reign an earthly king. therefore arise you son of kunti. brace yours arm for conflict nerve your heart to meet  as things alike to you  pleasure or pain profit or ruin victory or defeat so minded gird you to the fight for so you shalt not sin. thus far i speak to you as from the sankhya  unspiritually  hear now the deeper teaching of the yog which holding understanding you shalt burst your karmabandh the bondage of wrought deeds. here shall no end be hindered no hope marred no loss be feared faith  yea a little faith  shall save you from the anguish of your dread. here glory of the kurus. shines one rule  one steadfast rule  while shifting souls have laws many and hard. specious but wrongful deem the speech of those ill taught ones who extol the letter of their vedas saying  this is all we have or need  being weak at heart with wants seekers of heaven which comes  they say  as fruit of good deeds done  promising men much profit in new births for works of faith in various rites abounding following whereon large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power albeit who wealth and power do most desire least fixity of soul have such least hold on heavenly meditation. much these teach from veds concerning the three qualities  but you be free of the three qualities  free of the pairs of opposites  and free from that sad righteousness which calculates self ruled arjuna. simple sathis isfied. look. like as when a tank pours water forth to suit all needs so do these brahmaan draw text for all wants from tank of holy writ. but you want not. ask not. find full reward of doing right in right. let right deeds be your motive not the fruit which comes from them. and live in action. labour. make yours acts your piety casting all self aside contemning gain and merit equable in good or evil equability is yog is piety. yet the right act is less far less than the right thinking mind. seek refuge in your soul have there your heaven. scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts. the mind of pure devotion  even here  casts equally aside good deeds and bad passing above them. unto pure devotion devote yourself with perfect meditation comes perfect act and the right hearted rise  more certainly because they seek no gain  forth from the bands of body step by step to highest seats of bliss. when your firm soul hath shaken off those tangled oracles which ignorantly guide then shall it soar to high neglect of what s denied or said this way or that way in doctrinal writ. troubled no longer by the priestly lore safe shall it live and sure steadfastly bent on meditation. this is yog  and peace. arjuna. what is his mark who hath that steadfast heart confirmed in holy meditation. how know we his speech kesava. sits he moves he like other men. krishna. when one o pritha son. abandoning desires which shake the mind  finds in his soul full comfort for his soul he hath attained the yog  that man is such. in sorrows not dejected and in joys not overjoyed dwelling outside the stress of passion fear and anger fixed in calms of lofty contemplation  such an one is muni is the sage the true recluse. he who to none and nowhere overbound by ties of flesh takes evil things and good neither desponding nor exulting such bears wisdom plainest mark. he who shall draw as the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe under its shield his five frail senses back under the spirit buckler from the world which else assails them such an one my prince. hath wisdom mark. things that solicit sense hold off from the self governed nay it comes the appetites of him who lives beyond depart  aroused no more. yet may it chance o son of kunti. that a governed mind shall some time feel the sense storms sweep and wrest strong self control by the roots. let him regain his kingdom. let him conquer this and sit on me intent. that man alone is wise who keeps the mastery of himself. if one ponders on objects of the sense there springs attraction from attraction grows desire desire flames to fierce passion passion breeds recklessness then the memory  all betrayed  lets noble purpose go and saps the mind till purpose mind and man are all undone. but if one deals with objects of the sense not loving and not hating making them serve his free soul which rests serenely lord lo. such a man comes to tranquillity and out of that tranquillity shall rise the end and healing of his earthly pains since the will governed sets the soul at peace. the soul of the ungoverned is not his nor hath he knowledge of himself which lacked how grows serenity. and wanting that whence shall he hope for happiness. the mind that gives itself to follow shows of sense see its helm of wisdom rent away and like a ship in waves of whirlwind drives to wreck and death. only with him great prince. whose senses are not swayed by things of sense  only with him who holds his mastery shows wisdom perfect. what is midnight gloom to unenlightened souls shines wakeful day to his clear gaze what seems as wakeful day is known for night thick night of ignorance to his true seeing eyes. such is the saint. and like the ocean day by day receiving floods from all lands which never overflows its boundary line not leaping and not leaving fed by the rivers but unswelled by those  so is the perfect one. to his soul ocean the world of sense pours streams of witchery they leave him as they find wiyout commotion taking their tribute but remaining sea. yea. whoso shaking off the yoke of flesh lives lord not servant of his lusts set free from pride from passion from the sin of self  toucheth tranquillity. o pritha son. that is the state of brahma. there rests no dread when that last step is reached. live where he will die when he may such passeth from all plaining to blest nirvana with the gods attaining. Chapter_three_arjuna. you whom all mortals praise janardana. if meditation be a nobler thing than action wherefore then great kesava. dost you impel me to this dreadful fight. now am i by your doubtful speech disturbed. tell me one thing and tell me certainly by what road shall i find the better end. krishna. i told you blameless lord. there be two paths shown to this world two schools of wisdom. first the sankhya which doth save in way of works prescribed by reason next the yog which bids attain by meditation spiritually yet these are one. no man shall scape from act by shunning action nay and none shall come by mere renouncements unto perfectness. nay and no jot of time at any time rests any actionless his nature law compels him even unwilling into act  for yought is act in fancy . he who sits suppressing all the instruments of flesh yet in his idle heart thinking on them plays the inept and guilty hypocrite but he who with strong body serving mind gives up his mortal powers to woryour work not seeking gain arjuna. such an one is honourable. do yours allotted task. work is more excellent than idleness the body life proceeds not lacking work. there is a task of holiness to do unlike world binding toil which bind not the faithful soul such earthly duty do free from desire and you shalt well perform your heavenly purpose. speak prajapati  in the beginning when all men were made and with mankind the sacrifice  do this. work. sacrifice. increase and multiply with sacrifice. this shall be kamaduk your cow of plenty  giving back her milk of all abundance. worship the gods thereby the gods shall yield you grace. those meats ye crave the gods will grant to labour when it pays tithes in the altar flame. but if one eats fruits of the earth rendering to kindly heaven no gift of toil that thief steals from his world. who eat of food after their sacrifice are quit of fault but they that spread a feast all for themselves eat sin and drink of sin. by food the living live food comes of rain and rain comes by the pious sacrifice and sacrifice is paid with tithes of toil thus action is of brahmaa who is one the only all pervading at all times present in sacrifice. he that abstains to help the rolling wheels of this great world glutting his idle sense lives a lost life shameful and vain. existing for himself self concentrated serving self alone no part hath he in aught nothing achieved nought wrought or unwrought toucheth him no hope of help for all the living things of earth depends from him. therefore your task prescribed with spirit unattached gladly perform since in performance of plain duty man mounts to his highest bliss. by works alone janak and ancient saints reached blessedness. moreover for the upholding of your kind action you should embrace. what the wise choose the unwise people take what best men do the multitude will follow. look on me you son of pritha. in the three wide worlds i am not bound to any toil no height awaits to scale no gift remains to gain yet i act here. and if i acted not  earnest and watchful  those that look to me for guidance sinking back to sloth again because i slumbered would decline from good and i should break earthes order and commit her offspring unto ruin bharata. even as the unknowing toil wedded to sense so let the enlightened toil sense freed but set to bring the world deliverance and its bliss not sowing in those simple busy hearts seed of despair. yea. let each play his part in all he finds to do with unyoked soul. all things are everywhere by nature wrought in interaction of the qualities. the fool cheated by self thinks  this i did and that i wrought  but  ah you strong armed prince.  a better lessoned mind knowing the play of visible things within the world of sense and how the qualities must qualify stand aloof even from his acts. the untaught live mixed with them knowing not nature way of highest aims unwitting slow and dull. those make you not to stumble having the light but all your dues discharging for my sake with meditation centred inwardly seeking no profit sathis isfied serene heedless of issue  fight. they who shall keep my ordinance thus the wise and willing hearts have quittance from all issue of their acts but those who disregard my ordinance thinking they know know nought and fall to loss confused and foolish. sooth the instructed one doth of his kind following what fits him most and lower creatures of their kind in vain contending gainst the law. needs must it be the objects of the sense will stir the sense to like and dislike yet the enlightened man yields not to these knowing them enemies. finally this is better that one do his own task as he may even yough he fail than take tasks not his own yough they seem good. to die performing duty is no ill but who seeks other roads shall wander still. arjuna. yet tell me teacher. by what force doth man go to his ill unwilling as if one pushed him that evil path. krishna. kama it is. passion it is. born of the darknesses which pusheth him. mighty of appetite sinful and strong is this. man enemy. as smoke blots the white fire as clinging rust mars the bright mirror as the womb surrounds the babe unborn so is the world of things foiled soiled enclosed in this desire of flesh. the wise fall caught in it the unresting foe it is of wisdom wearing countless forms fair but deceitful subtle as a flame. sense mind and reason  these o arjuna. are booty for it in its play with these it maddens man beguiling blinding him. therefore you noblest child of bharata. govern your heart. constrain the entangled sense. resist the false soft sinfulness which saps knowledge and judgment. yea the world is strong but what discerns it stronger and the mind strongest and high o er all the ruling soul. wherefore perceiving him who reigns supreme put forth full force of soul in your own soul. fight. vanquish foes and doubts dear hero. slay what haunts you in fond shapes and would betray. Chapter_four_krishna. this deathless yoga this deep union i taught vivaswata the lord of light vivaswata to manu gave it he to ikshwaku so passed it down the line of all my royal rishis. then with years the truth grew dim and perished noble prince. now once again to you it is declared  this ancient lore this mystery supreme  seeing i find you votary and friend. arjuna. your birth dear lord was in these later days and bright vivaswata preceded time. how shall i comprehend this thing you sayest  from the beginning it was i who taught. krishna. manifold the renewals of my birth have been arjuna. and of your births too. but mine i know and yours you knowest not o slayer of your foes. albeit i be unborn undying indestructible the lord of all things living not the less  by maya by my magic which i stamp on floating nature forms the primal vast  i come and go and come. when righteousness declines o bharata. when wickedness is strong i rise from age to age and take visible shape and move a man with men succouring the good thrusting the evil back and setting virtue on her seat again. who knows the truth touching my births on earth and my divine work when he quits the flesh puts on its load no more falls no more down to earthly birth to me he comes dear prince. many there be who come. from fear set free from anger from desire keeping their hearts fixed upon me  my faithful  purified by sacred flame of knowledge. such as these mix with my being. whoso worship me them i exalt but all men everywhere shall fall into my path albeit those souls which seek reward for works make sacrifice now to the lower gods. i say to you here have they their reward. but i am he made the four castes and portioned them a place after their qualities and gifts. yea i created the reposeful i that live immortally made all those mortal births for works soil not my essence being works wrought uninvolved. who knows me acting thus unchained by action action binds not him and so perceiving all those saints of old worked seeking for deliverance. work you as in the days gone by your fathers did. you sayst perplexed it hath been asked before by singers and by sages  what is act and what inaction. i will teach you this and knowing you shalt learn which work doth save needs must one rightly meditate those three  doing  not doing  and undoing. here thorny and dark the path is. he who sees how action may be rest rest action  he is wisest mid his kind he hath the truth. he doeth well acting or resting. freed in all his works from prickings of desire burned clean in act by the white fire of truth the wise call that man wise and such an one renouncing fruit of deeds always content. always self sathis isfying if he works doth nothing that shall stain his separate soul which  quit of fear and hope  subduing self  rejecting outward impulse  yielding up to body need nothing save body dwells sinless amid all sin with equal calm taking what may befall by grief unmoved unmoved by joy unenvyingly the same in good and evil fortunes nowise bound by bond of deeds. nay but of such an one whose crave is gone whose soul is liberate whose heart is set on truth  of such an one what work he does is work of sacrifice which passeth purely into ash and smoke consumed upon the altar. all is then god. the sacrifice is brahma the ghee and grain are brahma the fire is brahma the flesh it eats is brahma and unto brahma attaineth he who in such office meditates on brahma. some votaries there be who serve the gods with flesh and altar smoke but other some who lighting subtler fires make purer rite with will of worship. of the which be they who in white flame of continence consume joys of the sense delights of eye and ear forgoing tender speech and sound of song and they who kindling fires with torch of truth burn on a hidden altar stone the bliss of youth and love renouncing happiness and they who lay for offering there their wealth their penance meditation piety their steadfast reading of the scrolls their lore painfully gained with long austerities and they who making silent sacrifice draw in their breath to feed the flame of yought and breathe it forth to waft the heart on high governing the ventage of each entering air lest one sigh pass which help not the soul and they who day by day denying needs lay life itself upon the altar flame burning the body wan. lo. all these keep the rite of offering as if they slew victims and all thereby efface much sin. yea. and who feed on the immortal food left of such sacrifice to brahmaa pass to the unending. but for him that makes no sacrifice he hath nor part nor lot even in the present world. how should he share another o you glory of your line. in sight of brahmaa all these offerings are spread and are accepted. comprehend that all proceed by act for knowing this you shalt be quit of doubt. the sacrifice which knowledge pays is better than great gifts offered by wealth since gifts worth  o my prince. lies in the mind which gives the will that serves and these are gained by reverence by strong search by humble heed of those who see the truth and teach it. knowing truth your heart no more will ache with error for the truth shall show all things subdued to you as you to me. moreover son of pandu. wert you worst of all wrong doers this fair ship of truth should bear you safe and dry across the sea of your transgressions. as the kindled flame feeds on the fuel till it sinks to ash so unto ash arjuna. unto nought the flame of knowledge wastes works dross away. there is no purifier like thereto in all this world and he who seeketh it shall find it  being grown perfect  in himself. believing he receives it when the soul masters itself and cleaves to truth and comes  possessing knowledge  to the higher peace the uttermost repose. but those untaught and those wiyout full faith and those who fear are shent no peace is here or other where no hope nor happiness for whoso doubts. he that being self contained hath vanquished doubt disparting self from service soul from works enlightened and emancipate my prince. works fetter him no more. cut then atwain with sword of wisdom son of bharata. this doubt that binds your heart beats. cleave the bond born of your ignorance. be bold and wise. give yourself to the field with me. arise. Chapter_five_arjuna. yet krishna. at the one time you dost laud surcease of works and at another time service through work. of these twain plainly tell which is the better way. krishna. to cease from works is well and to do works in holiness is well and both conduct to bliss supreme but of these twain the better way is his who working piously refraineth not. that is the true renouncer firm and fixed who  seeking nought rejecting nought  dwells proof against the opposites. o valiant prince. in doing such breaks lightly from all deed  this is the new scholar talks as they were two this sankhya and this yoga wise men know who husbands one plucks golden fruit of both. the region of high rest which sankhyans reach yogins attain. who sees these twain as one sees with clear eyes. yet such abstraction chief. is hard to win wiyout much holiness. whoso is fixed in holiness self ruled pure hearted lord of senses and of self lost in the common life of all which lives  a yogayukt  he is a saint who wends straightway to brahma. such an one is not touched by taint of deeds. nought of myself i do. thus will he think who holds the truth of truths  in seeing hearing touching smelling when he eats or goes or breathes slumbers or talks holds fast or loosens opes his eyes or shuts always assured this is the sense world plays with senses. he that acts in yought of brahma detaching end from act with act content the world of sense can no more stain his soul than waters mar the enamelled lotus leaf. with life with heart with mind nay with the help of all five senses  letting selfhood go  yogins toil ever towards their souls release. such votaries renouncing fruit of deeds gain endless peace the unvowed the passion bound seeking a fruit from works are fastened down. the embodied sage withdrawn within his soul at every act sits godlike in the town which hath nine gateways  neither doing aught nor causing any deed. this world s lord makes neither the work nor passion for the work nor lust for fruit of work the man own self pushes to these. the master of this world takes on himself the good or evil deeds of no man  dwelling beyond. mankind errs here by folly darkening knowledge. but for whom that darkness of the soul is chased by light splendid and clear shines manifest the truth as if a sun of wisdom sprang to shed its beams of dawn. him meditating still him seeking with him blended stayed on him the souls illuminated take that road which hath no turning back  their sins flung off by strength of faith. who will may have this light who hath it sees. to him who wisely sees the brahmaan with his scrolls and sanctities the cow the elephant the unclean dog the outcast gorging dog s meat are all one. the world is overcome  aye. even here. by such as fix their faith on unity. the sinless brahmaa dwells in unity and they in brahmaa. be not over glad attaining joy and be not over sad encountering grief but stayed on brahmaa still constant let each abide. the sage whose sou holds off from outer contacts in himself finds bliss to brahmaa joined by piety his spirit tastes eternal peace. the joys springing from sense life are but quickening wombs which breed sure griefs those joys begin and end. the wise mind takes no pleasure arjuna. in such as those. but if a man shall learn even while he lives and bears his body chain to master lust and anger he is blest. he is the yukta he hath happiness contentment light within his life is merged in brahmaa s life he doth nirvana touch. thus go the rishis unto rest who dwell with sins effaced with doubts at end with hearts governed and calm. glad in all good they live nigh to the peace of god and all those live who pass their days exempt from greed and wrath subduing self and senses knowing the soul. the saint who shuts outside his placid soul all touch of sense letting no contact through whose quiet eyes gaze straight from fixed brows whose outward breath and inward breath are drawn equal and slow through nostrils still and close that one with organs heart and mind constrained bent on deliverance having put away passion and fear and rage  hath even now obtained deliverance ever and ever freed. yea. for he knows me who am he that heeds the sacrifice and worship god revealed and he who heeds not being lord of worlds lover of all that lives god unrevealed wherein who will shall find surety and shield. Chapter_six_krishna. therefore who doeth work rightful to do not seeking gain from work that man o prince. is sanyasi and yogi  both in one and he is neither who lights not the flame of sacrifice nor setteth hand to task. regard as true renouncer him that makes worship by work for who renounceth not works not as yogin. so is that well said  by works the votary doth rise to faith and saintship is the ceasing from all works because the perfect yogin acts  but acts unmoved by passions and unbound by deeds setting result aside. let each man raise the self by soul not trample down his self since soul that is self s friend may grow self s foe. soul is self s friend when self doth rule o er self but self turns enemy if soul own self hates self as not itself. the sovereign soul of him who lives self governed and at peace is centred in itself taking alike pleasure and pain heat cold glory and shame. he is the yogi he is yukta glad with joy of light and truth dwelling apart upon a peak with senses subjugate whereto the clod the rock the glistering gold show all as one. by this sign is he known being of equal grace to comrades friends chance comers strangers lovers enemies aliens and kinsmen loving all alike evil or good. sequestered should he sit steadfastly meditating solitary his youghts controlled his passions laid away quit of belongings. in a fair still spot having his fixed abode  not too much raised nor yet too low  let him abide his goods a cloth a deerskin and the kusa grass. there setting hard his mind upon the one restraining heart and senses silent calm let him accomplish yoga and achieve pureness of soul holding immovable body and neck and head his gaze absorbed upon his nose end rapt from all around tranquil in spirit free of fear intent upon his brahmaacharya vow devout musing on me lost in the yought of me. that yojin so devoted so controlled comes to the peace beyond  my peace the peace of high nirvana. but for earthly needs religion is not his who too much fasts or too much feasts nor his who sleeps away an idle mind nor his who wears to waste his strength in vigils. nay arjuna. call that the true piety which most removes earth aches and ills where one is moderate in eating and in resting and in sport measured in wish and act sleeping betimes waking betimes for duty. when the man so living centres on his soul the yought straitly restrained  untouched internally by stress of sense  then is he yukta. see. steadfast a lamp burns sheltered from the wind such is the likeness of the yogi s mind shut from sense storms and burning bright to heaven. when mind broods placid soothed with holy wont when self contemplates self and in itself hath comfort when it knows the nameless joy beyond all scope of sense revealed to soul  only to soul. and knowing wavers not true to the farther truth when holding this it deems no other treasure comparable but harboured there cannot be stirred or shook by any gravest grief call that state peace  that happy severance yoga call that man the perfect yogin. steadfastly the will must toil thereto till efforts end in ease and yought has passed from thinking. shaking off all longings bred by dreams of fame and gain shutting the doorways of the senses close with watchful ward so step by step it comes to gift of peace assured and heart assuaged when the mind dwells self wrapped and the soul broods cumberless. but as often as the heart breaks  wild and wavering  from control so oft let him re curb it let him rein it back to the soul governance for perfect bliss grows only in the bosom tranquillised the spirit passionless purged from offence vowed to the infinite. he who thus vows his soul to the supreme soul quitting sin passes unhindered to the endless bliss of unity with brahmaa. he so vowed so blended sees the life soul resident in all things living and all living things in that life soul contained. and whoso thus discerneth me in all and all in me i never let him go nor looseneth he hold upon me but dwell he where he may whate er his life in me he dwells and lives because he knows and worships me who dwell in all which lives and cleaves to me in all. arjuna. if a man sees everywhere  taught by his own similitude  one life one essence in the evil and the good hold him a yogi yea. well perfected. arjuna. slayer of madhu. yet again this yog this peace derived from equanimity made known by you  i see no fixity therein no rest because the heart of men is unfixed krishna. rash tumultuous wilful and strong. it were all one i think to hold the wayward wind as tame man heart. krishna. hero long armed. beyond denial hard man heart is to restrain and wavering yet may it grow restrained by habit prince. by wont of self command. this yog i say cometh not lightly to the ungoverned ones but he who will be master of himself shall win it if he stoutly strive thereto. arjuna. and what road goeth he who having faith fails krishna. in the striving falling back from holiness missing the perfect rule. is he not lost straying from brahmaa s light like the vain cloud which floats twixt earth and heaven when lightning splits it and it vanisheth. fain would i hear you answer me herein since krishna. none save you can clear the doubt. krishna. he is not lost you son of pritha. no. nor earth nor heaven is forfeit even for him because no heart that holds one right desire treadeth the road of loss. he who should fail desiring righteousness cometh at death unto the region of the just dwells there measureless years and being born anew beginneth life again in some fair home amid the mild and happy. it may chance he doth descend into a yogin house on virtue s breast but that is rare. such birth is hard to be obtained on this earth chief. so hath he back again what heights of heart he did achieve and so he strives anew to perfectness with better hope dear prince. for by the old desire he is drawn on unwittingly and only to desire the purity of yog is to pass beyond the sabdabrahma the spoken ved. but being yogi striving strong and long purged from transgressions perfected by births following on births he plants his feet at last upon the farther path. such as one ranks above ascetics higher than the wise beyond achievers of vast deeds. be you yogi arjuna. and of such believe truest and best is he who worships me with inmost soul stayed on my mystery. Chapter_seven_krishna. learn now dear prince. how if your soul be set ever on me  still exercising yog still making me your refuge  you shalt come most surely unto perfect hold of me. i will declare to you that utmost lore whole and particular which when you knowest leaveth no more to know here in this world. of many yousand mortals one perchance striveth for truth and of those few that strive  nay and rise high  one only  here and there  know me as i am the very truth. earth water flame air ether life and mind and individuality  those eight make up the showing of me manifest. these be my lower nature learn the higher whereby you valiant one. this universe is by its principle of life produced whereby the worlds of visible things are born as from a yoni. know. i am that womb i make and i unmake this universe than me there is no other master prince. no other maker. all these hang on me as hangs a row of pearls upon its string. i am the fresh taste of the water i the silver of the moon the gold o the sun the word of worship in the veds the thrill that passeth in the ether and the strength of man shed seed. i am the good sweet smell of the moistened earth i am the fire s red light the vital air moving in all which moves the holiness of hallowed souls the root undying whence hath sprung whatever is the wisdom of the wise the intellect of the informed the greatness of the great. the splendour of the splendid. arjuna. these am i free from passion and desire yet am i right desire in all who yearn chief of the bharata. for all those moods soothfast or passionate or ignorant which nature frames deduce from me but all are merged in me  not i in them. the world  deceived by those three qualities of being  wotteth not me who am outside them all above them all eternal. hard it is to pierce that veil divine of various shows which hideth me yet they who worship me pierce it and pass beyond. i am not known to evil doers nor to foolish ones nor to the base and churlish nor to those whose mind is cheated by the show of things nor those that take the way of asuras. four sorts of mortals know me he who weeps arjuna. and the man who yearns to know and he who toils to help and he who sits certain of me enlightened. of these four o prince of india. highest nearest best that last is the devout soul wise intent upon the one. dear above all am i to him and he is dearest unto me. all four are good and seek me but mine own the true of heart the faithful  stayed on me taking me as their utmost blessedness they are not mine but i  even i myself. at end of many births to me they come. yet hard the wise mahatma is to find that man who sayeth  all is vasudev. there be those too whose knowledge turned aside by this desire or that gives them to serve some lower gods with various rites constrained by that which mouldeth them. unto all such  worship what shrine they will what shapes in faith  this is i who give them faith. i am content. the heart thus asking favour from its god darkened but ardent hath the end it craves the lesser blessing  but this is i who give. yet soon is withered what small fruit they reap those men of little minds who worship so go where they worship passing with their gods. but mine come unto me. blind are the eyes which deem the unmanifested manifest not comprehending me in my true self. imperishable viewless undeclared hidden behind my magic veil of shows i am not seen by all i am not known  unborn and changeless  to the idle world. but i arjuna. know all things which were and all which are and all which are to be albeit not one among them know me. by passion for the pairs of opposites  by those twain snares of like and dislike prince. all creatures live bewildered save some few who quit of sins holy in act informed freed from the opposites and fixed in faith cleave unto me. who cleave who seek in me refuge from birth and death those have the truth. those know me brahmaa know me soul of souls the adhyatman know karma my work know i am adhibhuta lord of life and adhidaiva lord of all the gods and adhiyajna lord of sacrifice worship me well with hearts of love and faith and find and hold me in the hour of death. Chapter_eight_arjuna. who is that brahmaa. what that soul of souls the adhyatman. what you best of all. your work the karma. tell me what it is you namest adhibhuta. what again means adhidaiva. yea and how it comes you canst be adhiyajna in your flesh. slayer of madhu. further make me know how good men find you in the hour of death. krishna. i brahmaa am. the one eternal god and adhyatman is my being s name the soul of souls. what goeth forth from me causing all life to live is karma called and manifested in divided forms i am the adhibhuta lord of lives and adhidaiva lord of all the gods because i am purusha who begets. and adhiyajna lord of sacrifice i  speaking with you in this body here  am you embodied one. for all the shrines flame unto me. and at the hour of death he that hath meditated me alone in putting off his flesh comes forth to me enters into my being  doubt you not. but if he meditated otherwise at hour of death in putting off the flesh he goes to what he looked for arjuna. because the soul is fashioned to its like. have me then in your heart always. and fight. you too when heart and mind are fixed on me shalt surely come to me. all come who cleave with never wavering will of firmest faith owning none other gods all come to me the uttermost purusha holiest. whoso hath known me lord of sage and singer ancient of days of all the three worlds stay boundless  but unto every atom bringer of that which quickens it whoso i say hath known my form which passeth mortal knowing seen my effulgence  which no eye hath seen  than the sun s burning gold more brightly glowing dispersing darkness  unto him hath been right life. and in the hour when life is ending with mind set fast and trustful piety drawing still breath beneath calm brows unbending in happy peace that faithful one doth die  in glad peace passeth to purusha s heaven. the place which they who read the vedas name aksharam  ultimate  whereto have striven saints and ascetics  their road is the same. that way  the highest way  goes he who shuts the gates of all his senses locks desire safe in his heart centres the vital airs upon his parting yought steadfastly set and murmuring om the sacred syllable  emblem of brahma  dies meditating me. for who none other gods regarding looks ever to me easily am i gained by such a yogi and attaining me they fall not  those mahatmas  back to birth to life which is the place of pain which ends but take the way of utmost blessedness. the worlds arjuna. even brahmaa s world  roll back again from death to life s unrest but they o arjuna. that reach to me taste birth no more. if ye know brahmaa s day which is a yousand yugas if ye know the yousand yugas making brahmaa s night then know ye day and night as he doth know. when that vast dawn doth break the invisible is brought anew into the visible when that deep night doth darken all which is fades back again to him who sent it forth yea. this vast company of living things  again and yet again produced  expires at brahmaa s nightfall and at brahmaa s dawn riseth wiyout its will to life new born. but  higher deeper innermost  abides another life not like the life of sense escaping sight unchanging. this endures when all created things have passed away this is that life named the unmanifest the infinite. the all. the uttermost. thither arriving none return. that life is mine and i am there. and prince. by faith which wanders not there is a way to come thither. i the purusha i who spread the universe around me  in whom dwell all living things  may so be reached and seen. . . . . . . . richer than holy fruit on vedas growing greater than gifts better than prayer or fast such wisdom is. the yogi this way knowing comes to the utmost perfect peace at last. Chapter_nine_krishna. now will i open unto you  whose heart rejects not  that last lore deepest concealed that farthest secret of my heavens and earths which but to know shall set you free from ills  a royal lore. a kingly mystery. yea. for the soul such light as purgeth it from every sin a light of holiness with inmost splendour shining plain to see easy to walk by inexhaustible. they that receive not this failing in faith to grasp the greater wisdom reach not me destroyer of your foes. they sink anew into the realm of flesh where all things change. by me the whole vast universe of things is spread abroad  by me the unmanifest. in me are all existences contained not i in them. yet they are not contained those visible things. receive and strive to embrace the mystery majestical. my being  creating all sustaining all  still dwells outside of all. see. as the shoreless airs move in the measureless space but are not space  and space were space wiyout the moving airs  so all things are in me but are not i. at closing of each kalpa indian prince. all things which be back to my being come at the beginning of each kalpa all issue new born from me. by energy and help of

worlds go on. the minds untaught mistake me veiled in form  naught see they of my secret presence nought of my hid nature ruling all which lives. vain hopes pursuing vain deeds doing fed on vainest knowledge senselessly they seek an evil way the way of brutes and fiends. but my mahatmas those of noble soul who tread the path celestial worship me with hearts unwandering  knowing me the source the

Chapter_seventeen_arjuna. if men forsake the holy ordinance heedless of shastras yet keep faith at heart and worship what shall be the state of those great krishna. sattwan rajas tamas. say. krishna. threefold the faith is of mankind and springs from those three qualities  becoming true  or passion stained  or dark  as you shalt hear. the faith of each believer indian prince. conforms itself to what he truly is. where you shalt see a worshipper that one to what he worships lives assimilate  such as the shrine so is the votary  the soothfast souls adore true gods the souls obeying rajas worship rakshasas or yakshas and the men of darkness pray to pretas and to bhutas. yea and those who practhis ise bitter penance not enjoined by rightful rule  penance which hath its root in self sufficient proud hypocrisies  those men passion beset violent wild torturing  the witless ones  my elements shut in fair company within their flesh  nay me myself present within the flesh. know them to devils devoted not to heaven. for like as foods are threefold for mankind in nourishing so is there threefold way of worship abstinence and almsgiving. hear this of me. there is a food which brings force substance strength and health and joy to live being well seasoned cordial comforting the soothfast meat. and there be foods which bring aches and unrests and burning blood and grief being too biting heating salt and sharp and therefore craved by too strong appetite. and there is foul food  kept from over night savourless filyour which the foul will eat a feast of rottenness meet for the lips of such as love the darkness. thus with rites  a sacrifice not for rewardment made offered in rightful wise when he who vows sayeth with heart devout  this i should do. is soothfast rite. but sacrifice for gain offered for good repute be sure that this o best of bharata. is rajas rite with stamp of passion. and a sacrifice offered against the laws with no due dole of food giving with no accompaniment of hallowed hymn nor largesse to the priests in faithless celebration call it vile the deed of darkness.  lost. worship of gods meriting worship lowly reverence of twice borns teachers elders purity rectitude and the brahmaacharya vow and not to injure any helpless thing  these make a true religiousness of act. words causing no man woe words ever true gentle and pleasing words and those ye say in murmured reading of a sacred writ  these make the true religiousness of speech. serenity of soul benignity sway of the silent spirit constant stress to sanctify the nature  these things make good rite and true religiousness of mind. such threefold faith in highest piety kept with no hope of gain by hearts devote is perfect work of sattwan true belief. religion shown in act of proud display to win good entertainment worship fame such  say i  is of rajas rash and vain. religion followed by a witless will to torture self or come at power to hurt another  this is of tamas dark and ill. the gift lovingly given when one shall say now must i gladly give. when he who takes can render nothing back made in due place due time and to a meet recipient is gift of sattwan fair and profitable. the gift selfishly given where to receive is hoped again or when some end is sought or where the gift is proffered with a grudge this is of rajas stained with impulse ill. the gift churlishly flung at evil time in wrongful place to base recipient made in disdain or harsh unkindliness is gift of tamas dark it doth not bless. Chapter_eighteen_arjuna. fain would i better know you glorious one. the very truth  heart s lord. of sannyas abstention and enunciation lord. tyaga and what separates these twain. krishna. the poets rightly teach that sannyas is the foregoing of all acts which spring out of desire and their wisest say tyaga is renouncing fruit of acts. there be among the saints some who have held all action sinful and to be renounced and some who answer  nay. the goodly acts  as worship penance alms  must be performed. hear now my sentence best of bharata. this is well set forth o chaser of your foes. renunciation is of threefold form and worship penance alms not to be stayed nay to be gladly done for all those three are purifying waters for true souls. yet must be practhis ised even those high works in yielding up attachment and all fruit produced by works. this is my judgment prince. this my insuperable and fixed decree. abstaining from a work by right prescribed never is meet. so to abstain doth spring from darkness  and delusion teach it. abstaining from a work grievous to flesh when one said  this isunpleasing. this is null. such an one acts from passion  nought of gain wins his renunciation. but arjun. abstaining from attachment to the work abstaining from rewardment in the work while yet one doeth it full faithfully saying  this is right to do. that is true  act and abstinence. who doeth duties so unvexed if his work fail if it succeed unflattered in his own heart justified quit of debates and doubts his is true act for being in the body none may stand wholly aloof from act yet who abstains from profit of his acts is abstinent. the fruit of labours in the lives to come is threefold for all men  desirable and undesirable and mixed of both but no fruit is at all where no work was. hear from me long armed lord. the makings five which go to every act in sankhya taught as necessary. first the force and then the agent next the various instruments fourth the especial effort fifth the god. what work soever any mortal doth of body mind or speech evil or good by these five doth he that. which being thus whoso for lack of knowledge see himself as the sole actor know nought at all and see nought. therefore i say if one  holding aloof from self  with unstained mind should slay all yonder host being bid to slay he doth not slay he is not bound thereby. knowledge the thing known and the mind which knows these make the threefold starting ground of act. the act the actor and the instrument these make the threefold total of the deed. but knowledge agent act are differenced by three dividing qualities. hear now which be the qualities dividing them. there is true knowledge. learn you it is this to see one changeless life in all the lives and in the separate one inseparable. there is imperfect knowledge that which sees the separate existences apart and being separated holds them real. there is false knowledge that which blindly clings to one as if twere all seeking no cause deprived of light narrow and dull and dark. there is right action that which being enjoined  is wrought wiyout attachment passionlessly for duty not for love nor hate nor gain. there is vain action that which men pursue aching to sathis isfy desires impelled by sense of self with all absorbing stress this is of rajas  passionate and vain. there is dark action when one doth a thing heedless of issues heedless of the hurt or wrong for others heedless if he harm his own soul  this is of tamas black and bad. there is the rightful doer. he who acts free from self seeking humble resolute steadfast in good or evil hap the same content to do aright he truly acts. there is the impassioned doer. he that works from impulse seeking profit rude and bold to overcome unchastened slave by turns of sorrow and of joy of rajas he. and there be evil doers loose of heart low minded stubborn fraudulent remiss dull slow despondent  children of the dark. hear too of intellect and steadfastness the threefold separation conqueror prince. how these are set apart by qualities. good is the intellect which comprehends the coming forth and going back of life what must be done and what must not be done what should be feared and what should not be feared what binds and what emancipates the soul that is of sattwan prince. of soothfastness. marred is the intellect which knowing right and knowing wrong and what is well to do and what must not be done yet understands nought with firm mind nor as the calm truth is this is of rajas prince. and passionate. evil is intellect which wrapped in gloom looks upon wrong as right and sees all things contrariwise of truth. o pritha son. that is of tamas  dark and desperate. good is the steadfastness whereby a man masters his beats of heart his very breath of life the action of his senses fixed in never shaken faith and piety that is of sattwan prince. soothfast and fair. stained is the steadfastness whereby a man holds to his duty purpose effort end for life s sake and the love of goods to gain arjuna. this is of rajas passion stamped. sad is the steadfastness wherewith the fool cleaves to his sloth his sorrow and his fears his folly and despair. this  pritha son.  is born of tamas  dark and miserable. hear further chief of bharata. from me the threefold kinds of pleasure which there be. good pleasure is the pleasure that endures banishing pain for aye bitter at first as poison to the soul but afterward sweet as the taste of amrit. drink of that. it spring in the spirit deep content. and painful pleasure spring from the bond between the senses and the sense world. sweet as amrit is its first taste but its last bitter as poison. this is of rajas prince. and foul and dark the pleasure is which springs from sloth and sin and foolishness at first and at the last and all the way of life the soul bewildering. this is of tamas prince. for nothing lives on earth nor midst the gods in utmost heaven but hath its being bound with these three qualities by nature framed. the work of brahmaan kshatriyas vaisyas and sudras o you slayer of your foes. is fixed by reason of the qualities planted in each a brahmaan virtues prince. born of his nature are serenity self mastery religion purity patience uprightness learning and to know the truth of things which be. a kshatriya s pride born of his nature lives in valour fire constancy skilfulness spirit in fight and open handedness and noble mien as of a lord of men. a vaisya s task born with his nature is to till the ground tend cattle venture trade. a sudra s state suiting his nature is to minister. whoso perform  diligent content  the work allotted him whate er it be lays hold of perfectness. hear how a man findeth perfection being so content he findeth it through worship  wrought by work  of him that is the source of all which lives of him by whom the universe was stretched. better yours own work is yough done with fault than doing others work even excellently. he shall not fall in sin who fronts the task set him by nature hand. let no man leave his natural duty prince. yough it bear blame. for every work hath blame as every flame is wrapped in smoke. only that man attains perfect surcease of work whose work was wrought with mind unfettered soul wholly subdued desires for ever dead results renounced. learn from me son of kunti. also this how one attaining perfect peace attains brahma the supreme the highest height of all. devoted  with a heart grown pure restrained in lordly self control forgoing wiles of song and senses freed from love and hate dwelling mid solitudes in diet spare with body speech and will tamed to obey ever to holy meditation vowed from passions liberate quit of the self of arrogance impatience anger pride freed from surroundings quiet lacking nought  such an one grows to oneness with the brahma such an one growing one with brahma serene sorrows no more desires no more his soul equally loving all that lives loves well me who have made them and attains to me. by this same love and worship doth he know me as i am how high and wonderful and knowing straightway enters into me. and whatsoever deeds he doeth  fixed in me as in his refuge  he hath won for ever and for ever by my grace the eternal rest. so win you. in your youghts do all you dost for me. renounce for me. sacrifice heart and mind and will to me. live in the faith of me. in faith of me all dangers you shalt vanquish by my grace but trusting to yourself and heeding not you can st but perish. if this day you say relying on yourself  i will not fight. vain will the purpose prove. your qualities would spur you to the war. what you dost shun misled by fair illusions you wouldst seek against your will when the task comes to you waking the promptings in your nature set. there lives a master in the hearts of men make their deeds by subtle pulling  strings dance to what tune he will. with all your soul trust him and take him for your succour prince. so  only so arjuna. shalt you gain  by grace of him  the uttermost repose the eternal place. thus hath been opened you this truth of truths the mystery more hid than any secret mystery. meditate. and  as you wilt  then act. nay. but once more take my last word my utmost meaning have. precious you art to me right well beloved. listen. i tell you for your comfort this. give me your heart. adore me. serve me. cling in faith and love and reverence to me. so shalt you come to me. i promise true for you art sweet to me. and let go those  rites and writ duties. fly to me alone. make me your single refuge. i will free your soul from all its sins. be of good cheer. hide the holy krishna said this from him that hath no faith him that worships not nor seeks wisdom teaching when she speaks hide it from all men who mock but wherever  mid the flock of my lovers one shall teach this divinest wisest speech  teaching in the faith to bring truth to them and offering of all honour unto me  unto brahmaa cometh he. nay and nowhere shall ye find any man of all mankind doing dearer deed for me nor shall any dearer be in my earth. yea furthermore whoso reads this converse o er held by us upon the plain pondering piously and fain he hath paid me sacrifice. krishna speak in this wise. yea and whoso full of faith hear wisely what it said hear meekly  when he dies surely shall his spirit rise to those regions where the blest free of flesh in joyance rest. hath this been heard by you o indian prince. with mind intent. hath all the ignorance  which bred your trouble  vanished my arjun. arjuna. trouble and ignorance are gone. the light hath come unto me by your favour lord. now am i fixed. my doubt is fled away. according to your word so will i do. sanjaya. thus gathered i the gracious speech of krishna o my king. thus have i told with heart a thrill this wise and wondrous thing by great vyasa learning writ how krishna self made known the yoga being yoga s lord. so is the high truth shown. and aye when i remember o lord my king again arjuna and the god in talk and all this holy strain great is my gladness when i muse that splendour passing speech of hari visible and plain there is no tongue to reach my marvel and my love and bliss. o archer prince. all hail. o krishna lord of yoga. surely there shall not fail blessing and victory and power for your most mighty sake where this song comes of arjun and how with god he speak. \n",

            "[' 1. Tell me, O Sanjaya, what my sons and Pandu\\'s assembled, on battle intent, did on the field of Kuru, the field of duty. The human body is the battlefield where the eternal duel between right and wrong goes on. Therefore it is capable of being turned into a gateway to Freedom. It is born in sin and becomes the seed-bed of sin. Hence it is also called the field of Kuru. The Kuravas represent the forces of Evil, the Pandavas the forces of Good. Who is there that has not experienced the daily conflict within himself between the forces of Evil and the forces of Good? Sanjaya Said: 2. On seeing the Pandava\\'s army drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana approached Drona, the preceptor, and addressed him thus: 3. Behold, O preceptor, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, set in array by the son of Drupada, thy wise disciple. 4. Here are brave bowmen, peers of Bhima and Arjuna in fighting: Yuyudhana and Virata, and the ‘Maharatha\\' Drupada. 5. Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, valorous Kashiraja, Purujit the Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya, chief among men; 6. Valiant Yudhamanyu, valorous Uttamaujas, Subhadra\\'s son, and the sons of Draupadi--each one of them a \\'Maharatha\\'. 7. Acquaint thyself now, O best of Brahmanas, with the distinguished among us. I mention for thy information, the names of the captains of my army. 8. Thy noble self, Bhishma, Karna, and Kripa, victorious in battle, Ashvatthaman, Vikarna, also Somadatta\\'s son; 9. There is many another hero, known for his skill in wielding diverse weapons, pledged to lay down his life for my sake, and all adepts in war. 10. This our force, commanded by Bhishma, is all too inadequate; while theirs, commanded by Bhima, is quite adequate. 11. Therefore, let each of you, holding your appointed places, at every entrance, guard only Bhishma. 12. At this, the heroic grandsire, the grand old man of the Kurus, gave a loud lion\\'s roar and blew his conch to hearten Duryodhana. 13. Thereupon, conches, drums, cymbals and trumpets were sounded all at once. Terrific was the noise. 14. Then Madhava and Pandava, standing in their great chariot yoked with white steeds, blew their divine conches. 15. Hrishikesha blew the Panchajanya and Dhananjaya the Devadatta; while the wolf-bellied Bhima of dread deeds sounded his great conch Paundra. 16. King Yudhishthira, Kunti\\'s son, blew the Anantavijaya, and Nakula nd Sahadeva their conches, Sughosha and Manipushpaka. 17. And Kashiraja, the great bowman, Shikhandi Dhrishtadyumna, Virata and Satyaki, the unconquerable; the \\'Maharatha\\', 18. Drupada, Draupadi\\'s sons, the strong-armed son of Subhadra, all these, O King, blew each his own conch. 19. That terrifying tumult, causing earth and heaven to resound, rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra\\'s sons. 20-21. Then, O King, the ape-bannered Pandava, seeing Dhritarashtra\\'s sons arrayed and flight of arrows about to begin, took up his bow, and spoke thus to Hrishikesha: \"Set my chariot between the two armies, O Achyuta!\" 22. That I may behold them drawn up, on battle intent, and know whom I have to engage in this fearful combat; 23. And that I may survey the fighters assembled here anxious to fulfil in battle perverse Duryodhana\\'s desire. Sanjaya Said: 24-25. Thus addressed by Gudakesha, O King, Hrishikesha set the unique chariot between the two armies in front of Bhishma, Drona and all the kings and said: Behold, O Partha, the Kurus assembled yonder. 26-28. Then did Partha see, standing there, sires, grandsires, preceptors, uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law and friends in both armies. Beholding all these kinsmen ranged before him, Kaunteya was overcome with great compassion and spake thus in anguish: Arjuna Said: 28-29. As I look upon these kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled here eager to fight, my limbs fail, my mouth is parched, a tremor shakes my frame and my hair stands on end. 30. Gandiva slips from my hand, my skin is on fire, I cannot keep my feet, and my mind reels. 31. I have unhappy forebodings, O Keshava; and I see no good in slaying kinsmen in battle. 32. I seek not victory, nor sovereign power, nor earthly joys. What good are sovereign power, worldly pleasures and even life to us, O Govinda? 33. Those for whom we would desire sovereign power, earthly joys and delights are here arrayed in battle, having renounced life and wealth-34. Preceptors, sires, grandsires, sons and even fathers-in-law, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen. grandsons, uncles, 35. These I would not kill, O Madhusudana, even though they slay me, not even for kingship of the three worlds, much less for an earthly kingdom. 36. What pleasure can there be in slaying these sons of Dhritarashtra, O Janardana? Sin only can be our lot, if we slay these, usurpers though they be. 37. It does not therefore behove us to kill our kinsmen, these sons of Dhritarashtra. How may we be happy, O Madhava, in killing our own kins? 38. Even though these, their wits warped by greed, see not the guilt that lies in destroying the family, nor the sin of treachery to comrades; 39. How can we, O Janardana, help recoiling from this sin, seeing clearly as we do the guilt that lies in such destruction? 40. With the destruction of the family perish the eternal family virtues, and with the perishing of these virtues unrighteousness seizes the whole family. 41. When unrighteousness prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupt, and their corruption, O Varshneya, causes a confusion of varnas. 42. This confusion verily drags the family-slayer, as well as the family, to hell, and for want of obsequial offerings and rites their departed sires fall from blessedness. 43. By the sins of these family-slayers resulting in confusion of varnas, the eternal tribal and family virtues are brought to naught. 44. For we have had it handed down to us, O Janardana, that the men whose family virtues have been ruined are doomed to dwell in hell. 45. Alas! What a heinous sin we are about to commit, in that, from greed of the joy of sovereign power, we are prepared to slay our kith and kin! 46. Happier far would it be for me if Dhritarashtra\\'s sons, weapons in hand, should strike me down on the battlefield, unresisting and unarmed. Sanjaya Said: 47. Thus spake Arjuna on the field of battle, and dropping his bow and arrows sank down on his seat in the chariot, overwhelmed with anguish. ']\n"

Sanjaya Said:  On seeing Pandava's army drawn battle array, King Duryodhana approached Drona, preceptor, addressed thus:  Behold, O preceptor, mighty army sons Pandu, set array son Drupada, thy wise disciple.  Here brave bowmen, peers Bhima Arjuna fighting: Yuyudhana Virata, Maharatha' Drupada.  Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, valorous Kashiraja, Purujit Kuntibhoja, Shaibya, chief among men;  Valiant Yudhamanyu, valorous Uttamaujas, Subhadra's son, sons Draupadi--each one 'Maharatha'.  Acquaint thyself now, O best Brahmanas, distinguished among us. I mention thy information, names captains army.  Thy noble self, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, victorious battle, Ashvatthaman, Vikarna, also Somadatta's son;  There many another hero, known skill wielding diverse weapons, pledged lay life sake, adepts war.   This force, commanded Bhishma, inadequate; theirs, commanded Bhima, quite adequate.   Therefore, let you, holding appointed places, every entrance, guard Bhishma.   At this, heroic grandsire, grand old man Kurus, gave loud lion's roar blew conch hearten Duryodhana.   Thereupon, conches, drums, cymbals trumpets sounded once. Terrific noise.   Then Madhava Pandava, standing great chariot yoked white steeds, blew divine conches.   Hrishikesha blew Panchajanya Dhananjaya Devadatta; wolf-bellied Bhima dread deeds sounded great conch Paundra.   King Yudhishthira, Kunti's son, blew Anantavijaya, Nakula nd Sahadeva conches, Sughosha Manipushpaka.   And Kashiraja, great bowman, Shikhandi Dhrishtadyumna, Virata Satyaki, unconquerable; 'Maharatha',   Drupada, Draupadi's sons, strong-armed son Subhadra, these, O King, blew conch.   That terrifying tumult, causing earth heaven resound, rent hearts Dhritarashtra's sons.   -  Then, O King, ape-bannered Pandava, seeing Dhritarashtra's sons arrayed flight arrows begin, took bow, spoke Hrishikesha: \"Set chariot two armies, O Achyuta!\"   That I may behold drawn up, battle intent, know I engage fearful combat;   And I may survey fighters assembled anxious fulfil battle perverse Duryodhana's desire. Sanjaya Said:   -  Thus addressed Gudakesha, O King, Hrishikesha set unique chariot two armies front Bhishma, Drona kings said: Behold, O Partha, Kurus assembled yonder.   -  Then Partha see, standing there, sires, grandsires, preceptors, uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law friends armies. Beholding kinsmen ranged him, Kaunteya overcome great compassion spake anguish: Arjuna Said:   -  As I look upon kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled eager fight, limbs fail, mouth parched, tremor shakes frame hair stands end.   Gandiva slips hand, skin fire, I cannot keep feet, mind reels.   I unhappy forebodings, O Keshava; I see no good slaying kinsmen battle.   I seek not victory, sovereign power, earthly joys. What good sovereign power, worldly pleasures even life us, O Govinda?   Those would desire sovereign power, earthly joys delights arrayed battle, renounced life wealth-  Preceptors, sires, grandsires, sons even fathers-in-law, brothers-in-law, kinsmen. grandsons, uncles,   These I would not kill, O Madhusudana, even though slay me, not even kingship three worlds, much less earthly kingdom.   What pleasure slaying sons Dhritarashtra, O Janardana? Sin lot, slay these, usurpers though be.   It not therefore behove us kill kinsmen, sons Dhritarashtra. How may happy, O Madhava, killing kins?   Even though these, wits warped greed, see not guilt lies destroying family, sin treachery comrades;   How we, O Janardana, help recoiling sin, seeing clearly guilt lies destruction?   With destruction family perish eternal family virtues, perishing virtues unrighteousness seizes whole family.   When unrighteousness prevails, O Krishna, women family become corrupt, corruption, O Varshneya, causes confusion varnas.   This confusion verily drags family-slayer, well family, hell, want obsequial offerings rites departed sires fall blessedness.   By sins family-slayers resulting confusion varnas, eternal tribal family virtues brought naught.   For handed us, O Janardana, men whose family virtues ruined doomed dwell hell.   Alas! What heinous sin commit, that, greed joy sovereign power, prepared slay kith kin!   Happier far would Dhritarashtra's sons, weapons hand, strike battlefield, unresisting unarmed. Sanjaya Said:   Thus spake Arjuna field battle, dropping bow arrows sank seat chariot, overwhelmed anguish. Chapter_two  To Arjuna, overcome compassion, sorrowing, eyes obscured flowing tears, Madhusudana spake words: The Lord Said:  How perilous moment delusion, unworthy noble, leading neither heaven glory, overtaken thee?  Yield not unmanliness, O Partha; not become thee. Shake miserable faint-heartedness arise, O Parantapa! Arjuna Said:  How I, arrows, engage Bhishma Drona battle, O Madhusudana, worthy reverence, O Arisudana?  It better far live alms world slay venerable elders. Having slain I blood-stained enjoyments.  Nor know better us, conquer conquer us, stand us Dhritarashtra's sons killed no desire live.  My paralysed faint-heartedness; mind discerns not duty; hence I ask thee; tell me, I pray thee, no uncertain language, wherein lies good. I thy disciple; guide me; I see refuge thee.  For I see nothing dispel anguish shrivels senses even I win earth uncontested sovereignty thriving kingdom lordship gods. Sanjaya Said:  Thus spoke Gudakesha Parantapa Hrishikesha Govinda, words 'I not fight' became speechless.   To stricken anguish, O Bharata! two armies, Hrishikesha, though mocking, addressed words: The Lord Said:   Thou mournest thou shouldst not mourn utterest vain words wisdom. The wise mourn neither living dead.   For never I not, thou, kings; us cease hereafter.   As embodied one has, present body, infancy, youth age, even receive another body. The wise man not deceived therein.   O Kaunteya! Contacts senses objects bring cold heat, pleasure pain; come go transient. Endure them, O Bharata.   O noblest men, wise man not disturbed these, unmoved pleasure pain, fitted immortality.   What non-Being never known been, Being never known not been. Of secret seen seers Truth.   Know imperishable whereby pervaded. No one destroy immutable being.   These bodies embodied one eternal, imperishable immeasurable finite. Fight, therefore, O Bharata.   He thinks This (Atman) slayer believes This slain, ignorant. This neither slays ever slain.   This never born ever dies, ever not more; unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient, This not slain body slain.   He knows This, O Partha, imperishable, eternal, unborn, immutablewhom man slay cause slain?   As man casts worn-out garments takes others new, even embodied one casts worn-out bodies passes others new.   This no weapons wound, This no fire burns, This no waters wet, This no wind doth dry.   Beyond cutting, burning, wetting drying This-eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, everlasting.   Perceivable neither senses mind, This called unchangeable; therefore knowing This thou shouldst not grieve.   And thou deemest This always coming birth always dying, even then, O Mahabahu, thou shouldst not grieve.   For certain death born, certain birth dead; therefore unavoidable thou shouldst not regret.   The state beings birth unmanifest; middle state manifest; state death unmanifest. What occasion lament, O Bharata?   One looks upon This marvel; another speaks This such; another hears thereof marvel; yet heard This none truly knows This.   This embodied one body every ever beyond harm, O Bharata; thou shouldst not, therefore, grieve one. Thus far Lord Krishna, force argument based pure reason, demonstrated Atman abiding physical body fleeting, explained if, certain circumstances, destruction physical body deemed justifiable, delusion imagine Kauravas not slain kinsmen. Now reminds Arjuna duty Kshatriya.   Again, seeing thine duty thou shouldst not shrink it; no higher good Kshatriya righteous war.   Such fight, coming unsought, gateway heaven thrown open, falls lot happy Kshatriyas, O Partha.   But thou wilt not fight righteous fight, failing thy duty losing thine honour thou wilt incur sin.   The world ever recount story thy disgrace; man honour disgrace worse death.   The Maharathas think fear made thee retire battle; thou wilt fall esteem ones held thee high.   Thine enemies deride thy prowess speak many unspeakable words thee. What painful that?   Slain, thou shalt gain heaven; victorious, thou inherit earth: therefore arise, O Kaunteya, determined fight. Having declared highest truth, viz. immortality eternal Atman fleeting nature physical body (  -  ), Krishna reminds Arjuna Kshatriya may not flinch fight comes unsought (  -  ). He (  -  ) shows highest truth performance duty incidentally coincide expediency. Next proceeds foreshadow central teaching Gita following shloka.   Hold alike pleasure pain, gain loss, victory defeat, gird thy loins fight; thou shalt not incur sin.   Thus I set thee attitude Knowledge; hear attitude Action; resorting attitude thou shalt cast bondage action.   Here no effort undertaken lost, no disaster befalls. Even little righteous course delivers one great fear.   The attitude, matter, springing, does, fixed resolve one, O Kurunandana; no fixed resolve attitudes many-branched unending. When attitude ceases one undivided becomes many divided, ceases one settled will, broken various wills desires man tossed about.   -  The ignorant, revelling letter Vedas, declare naught else; carnally-minded, holding heaven goal, utter swelling words promise birth fruit action dwell many varied rites performed sake pleasure power; intent, are, pleasure power swelling words rob wits, no settled attitude centered supreme goal. The Vedic ritual, opposed doctrine Yoga laid Gita, alluded here. The Vedic ritual lays countless ceremonies rites view attaining merit heaven. These, divorced essence Vedas short-lived result, worthless.   The Vedas domain three gunas; eschew them, O Arjuna. Free thyself pairs opposites, abide eternal truth, scorn gain guard anything, remain master thy soul.   To extent well use flood water sides, extent Vedas use enlightened Brahmana.   Action alone thy province, never fruits thereof; let not thy motive fruit action, shouldst thou desire avoid action.   Act thou, O Dhananjaya, without attachment, steadfast Yoga, even-minded success failure. Even-mindedness Yoga.   For action, O Dhananjaya, far inferior unattached action; seek refuge attitude detached action. Pitiable make fruit motive.   Here world man gifted attitude detachment escapes fruit good evil deeds. Gird thyself Yoga, therefore. Yoga skill action.   For sages, gifted attitude detachment, renounce fruit action, released bondage birth attain state free ills.   When thy understanding passed slough delusion, wilt thou indifferent alike thou hast heard wilt hear.   When thy understanding, distracted much hearing, rest steadfast unmoved concentration, wilt thou attain Yoga. Arjuna Said:   What, O Keshava, mark man whose understanding secure, whose mind fixed concentration? How talk? How sit? How move. The Lord Said:   When man puts away, O partha, cravings arise mind finds comfort Atman, called man secure understanding. To find comfort oneself Atman means look spirit within spiritual comfort, not outside objects nature must give pleasure well pain. Spiritual comfort bliss must distinguished pleasure happiness. The pleasure I may derive possession wealth, instance, delusive; real spiritual comfort bliss attained I rise superior every temptation even though troubled pangs poverty hunger.   Whose mind untroubled sorrows longeth not joys, free passion, fear wrathhe called ascetic secure understanding.   Who owns attachment nowhere, feels neither joy resentment whether good bad comes waythat man's understanding secure.   And when, like tortoise drawing limbs every side, man draws senses objects, understanding secure.   When man starves senses, objects senses disappear him, not yearning them; yearning departs beholds Supreme. The shloka not rule fasting forms self-restraint, indicates limitations, restraints needed subduing desire sense-objects, however rooted one vision Supreme. The higher yearning conquers lower yearnings.   For, spite wise man's endeavour, O Kaunteya, unruly senses distract mind perforce.   Holding check, yogi sit intent Me; whose senses control secure understanding. This means without devotion consequent grace God, man's endeavour vain.   In man brooding objects senses, attachment springs up; attachment begets craving craving begets wrath. Craving cannot lead resentment, unending unsatisfied.   Wrath breeds stupefaction, stupefaction leads loss memory, loss memory ruins reason, ruin reason spells utter destruction.   But disciplined soul, moving among sense-objects senses weaned likes dislikes brought control Atman, attains peace mind.   Peace mind means end ills, understanding whose mind peace stands secure.   The undisciplined man neither understanding devotion; no devotion no peace, no peace whence happiness?   For mind runs roaming senses, sweeps away understanding, wind vessel upon waters.   Therefore, O Mahabahu, he, whose senses reined sides objects, man secure understanding.   When night beings, disciplined soul awake; beings awake, night seeing ascetic. This verse indicates divergent paths discipline ascetic sensual man. Whereas ascetic dead things world lives God, sensual man alive things world dead things spirit.   He longings subside, even waters subside ocean which, though ever filled them, never overflowsthat man finds peace; not cherishes longing.   The man sheds longing moves without concern, free sense I' Mine'he attains peace.   This state, O partha, man rests Brahman; attained it, not deluded. He abides state even hour death passes oneness Brahman. Chapter_three  If, O Janardana, thou holdest attitude detachment superior action, why, O Keshava, dost thou urge dreadful action?  Thou dost seem confuse understanding perplexing speech; tell me, therefore, no uncertain voice, alone whereby I may attain salvation. Arjuna sore perplexed, whilst one hand rebuked faint-heartedness, seems advised refrain action (II.  -  ). But this, reality, not case following shlokas show. The Lord Said:  I spoken, before, O sinless one, two attitudes worldthe Sankhayas', Jnana yoga Yogins', karma yoga.  Never man enjoy freedom action not undertaking action, attain freedom mere renunciation action. Freedom action' freedom bondage action. This freedom not gained cessation activity, apart fact cessation nature things impossible (see following shloka). How may gained? The following shlokas explain.  For none ever remains inactive even moment; compelled action gunas inherent prakriti.  He curbs organs action allows mind dwell sense-objects,such one, wholly deluded, called hypocrite. The man curbs tongue mentally swears another hypocrite. But not mean free rein given organs action long mind cannot brought control. Self-imposed physical restraint condition precedent mental restraint. Physical restraint entirely self-imposed not super-imposed outside, e.g. fear. The hypocrite held contempt not humble aspirant self-restraint. The shloka reference man curbs body cannot help indulging mind, would indulge body possibly could. The next shloka puts thing conversely.  But he, O Arjuna, keeping senses control mind, engages organs Karma yoga, without attachmentthat man excels. The mind body made accord well. Even mind kept control, body active one way another. But whose mind truly restrained will, instance, close ears foul talk open listen praise God good men. He no relish sensual pleasures keep occupied activity ennobles soul. That path action. Karma yoga yoga (means) deliver self bondage body, no room self-indulgence.  Do thou thy allotted task; action superior inaction; inaction even life's normal course not possible.  This world men suffers bondage action save done sake sacrifice; end, O Kaunteya, perform action without attachment. Action sake sacrifice' means acts selfless service dedicated God.   Together sacrifice Lord beings create, old, mankind, declaring: \"By ye increase; may giver desires.   \"With may cherish gods may gods cherish you; cherishing one another may attain highest good.   \"Cherished sacrifice, gods bestow desired boons.\" He enjoys gifts without rendering aught unto verily thief. \"Gods\" shlokas       must taken mean whole creation God. The service created beings service gods sacrifice.   The righteous men eat residue sacrifice freed sin, wicked cook eat sin.   From food springs life, rain born food; sacrifice comes rain sacrifice result action.   Know action springs Brahman Brahman Imperishable; hence all-pervading Brahman ever firm-founded sacrifice.   He not follow wheel set motion below, he, living sin, sating senses, lives, O Partha, vain.   But man revels Atman, content Atman satisfied Atman, no action exists.   He no interest whatever anything done, anything not done, need rely anything personal ends.   Therefore, thou ever perform without attachment work thou must do; performing action without attachment man attains Supreme.   For action alone Janaka others achieved perfection; even view guidance mankind thou must act.   Whatever best man does, also done men, example sets, world follows.   For me, O Partha, naught three worlds, nothing worth gaining I not gained; yet I ever action. An objection sometimes raised God impersonal not likely perform physical activity, best He may supposed act mentally. This not correct. For unceasing movement sun, moon, earth etc. signifies God action. This not mental physical activity. Though God without form impersonal, He acts though He form body. Hence though He ever action, He free action, unaffected action. What must borne mind that, Nature's movements processes mechanical yet guided Divine Intelligence Will, even man must reduce daily conduct mechanical regularity precision, must intelligently. Man's merit lies observing divine guidance back processes intelligent imitation rather emphasizing mechanical nature thereof reducing automation. One withdraw self, withdraw attachment fruit action, not mechanical precision security wear tear ensured. Acting man remains fresh end days. His body perish due course, soul remain evergreen without crease wrinkle.   Indeed, I not, unslumbering, ever remain action, O Partha, men would follow example every way.   If I not perform task, worlds would ruined; I cause chaos end mankind.   Just as, attachment, unenlightened perform actions, O Bharata, even so, unattached, enlightened man act, desire welfare humanity.   The enlightened may not confuse mind unenlightened, attached action; rather must perform actions unattached, encourage likewise.   All action entirely done gunas prakriti. Man, deluded sense I', thinks, I doer'.   But he, O Mahabahu, understands truth various gunas various activities, knows gunas operate gunas; not claim doer. As breathing, winking similar processes automatic man claims no agency them, conscious processes disease similar cause arrests them, similar manner acclivities automatic, without arrogating agency responsibility thereof. A man charity not even know charitable acts, nature so, cannot help it. This detachment come tireless endeavour God's grace.   Deluded gunas prakriti men become attached activities gunas; knows truth things not unhinge slow-witted not knowledge.   Cast thy acts Me, thy mind fixed indwelling Atman, without thought fruit, sense mine' shake thy fever fight! He knows Atman inhabiting body realizes Him part supreme Atman dedicate everything Him, even faithful servant acts mere shadow master dedicates does. For master real doer, servant instrument.   Those always act according rule I laid down, faith without cavillingthey released bondage actions.   But cavil rule refuse conform fools, dead knowledge; know lost.   Even man knowledge acts according nature; creatures follow nature; constraint avail? Man's energies bent towards achieving complete self-restraint end days. But not succeed, neither constraint help him. The shloka not rule restraint explains nature prevails. He justifies saying, I cannot this, not nature,' misreads shloka. True not know nature, habit not nature. Progress, not decline, ascent, not descent, nature soul, therefore every threatened decline descent ought resisted.   Each sense settled likes dislikes towards objects; man not come sway these, besetters. Hearing, instance, object ears may inclined hear something disinclined hear something else. Man may not allow swayed likes dislikes, must decide conducive growth, ultimate end reach state beyond happiness misery.   Better one's duty, bereft merit, another's well-performed; better death discharge one's duty; another's duty fraught danger. One man's duty may serve community working sweeper, another's may work accountant. An accountant's work may inviting, need not draw sweeper away work. Should allow drawn away would lost put community danger. Before God work man judged spirit done, not nature work makes no difference whatsoever. Whoever acts spirit dedication fits salvation. Arjuna Said:   Then impels man sin, O Varshneya, even will, though force compelled? The Lord Said:   It Lust, Wrath, born gunaRajas. It arch-devourer, arch-sinner. Know man's enemy here.   As fire obscured smoke, mirror dirt, embryo amnion, knowledge obscured this.   Knowledge obscured, O Kaunteya, eternal enemy wise man, form Lust, insatiable fire.   The senses, mind reason said great seat; means obscures knowledge stupefies man. When Lust seizes senses, mind corrupted, discrimination obscured reason ruined. See II.   -    Therefore, O Bharatarshabha, bridle thou first senses rid thyself sinner, destroyer knowledge discrimination.   Subtle, say, senses; subtler senses mind; subtler mind reason; subtler even reason He.   Thus realizing Him subtler reason, controlling self Self (Atman), destroy, O Mahabahu, enemyLust, hard overcome. When man realizes Him, mind control, not swayed senses. And mind conquered, power Lust? It indeed subtle enemy, senses, mind reason control subtlemost Self, Lust extinguished. Chapter_four  I expounded imperishable yoga Vivasvat; Vivasvat communicated Manu, Manu Ikshvaku.  Thus handed succession, royal sages learnt it; long lapse time dwindled away world, O Parantapa.  The ancient yoga I expounded thee today; thou art My devotee My friend, supreme mystery. Arjuna Said:  Later Thy birth, Lord, earlier Vivasvat. How I understand Thou didst expound beginning? The Lord Said:  Many births passed through, O Arjuna, thou I; I know all, thou knowest not, O Parantapa. Though unborn inexhaustible My essence, though Lord beings, yet assuming control My Nature, I come My mysterious power.  For whenever Right declines Wrong prevails, O Bharata, I come birth.  To save righteous, destroy wicked, re-establish Right I born age age. Here comfort faithful affirmation truth Right ever prevails. An eternal conflict Right Wrong goes on. Sometimes latter seems get upper hand, Right ultimately prevails. The good never destroyed, Rightwhich Truthcannot perish; wicked destroyed, Wrong no independent existence. Knowing let man cease arrogate authorship eschew untruth, violence evil. Inscrutable Providencethe unique power Lordis ever work. This fact avatara, incarnation. Strictly speaking no birth God.  He knows secret My divine birth action not born again, leaving body; comes Me, O Arjuna. For man secure faith Right always prevails, never swerves therefrom, pursuing bitterest end serious odds, no part effort proceeds ego, dedicated Him, ever one Him, released birth death.   Freed passion, fear wrath, filled full Me, relying Me, refined fiery ordeal knowledge, many become one Me.   In whatever way men resort Me, even I render them. In every way, O Partha, path men follow Mine. That is, whole world His ordinance. No one may break God's law impunity. As sow, reap. This law operates inexorably without fear favor.   Those desire actions bear fruit worship gods here; world men fruit action quickly obtainable. Gods, indicated before, must not taken mean heavenly beings tradition, whatever reflects divine. In sense man also god. Steam, electricity great forces Nature gods. Propitiation forces quickly bears fruit, well know, short-lived. It fails bring comfort soul certainly not take one even short step towards salvation.   The order four varnas created Me according different gunas karma each; yet know though, therefore, author thereof, changeless I not author.   Actions not affect Me, I concerned fruits thereof. He recognizes Me not bound actions. For man supreme example one though action not doer thereof. And instruments His hands, room arrogating responsibility action?   Knowing men old, desirous freedom, perform action; thou, then, didthe men old days gone by.   What action? What inaction?'here even wise perplexed. I expound thee action knowing thou shalt saved evil.   For meet know meaning action, forbidden action, also inaction. Impenetrable secret action.   Who sees action action action inaction, enlightened among men, yogi, done need do. The action' who, though ever active, not claim doer, inaction; inaction' who, though outwardly avoiding action, always building castles mind, action. The enlightened man grasped secret action knows no action proceeds him, proceeds God hence selflessly remains absorbed action. He true yogi. The man acts self-fully misses secret action cannot distinguish Right Wrong. The soul's natural progress towards selflessness purity one might, therefore, say man strays path purity strays selflessness. All actions selfless man naturally pure.   He whose every undertaking free desire selfish purpose, burnt actions fire knowledgesuch one wise call pandita.   He renounced attachment fruit action, ever content, free dependence,he, though immersed action, yet acts not. That is, action not bind him.   Expecting naught, holding mind body check, putting away every possession, going action body incurs no stain. The purest act, tainted self', binds. But done spirit dedication, ceases bind. When self' completely subsided, body works. For instance, case man asleep body alone working. A prisoner prison tasks surrendered body prison authorities body, therefore, works. Similarly, voluntarily made God's prisoner, nothing himself. His body mechanically acts, doer God, hot he. He reduced nothingness.   Content whatever chance may bring, rid pairs opposites, free ill-will, even-minded success failure, not bound though acts.   Of free soul shred attachment, whose mind firmly grounded knowledge, acts sacrifice, karma extinguished.   The offering sacrifice Brahman; oblation Brahman; offered Brahman fire Brahman; whose mind fixed acts dedicated Brahman must needs pass Brahman.   Some yogins perform sacrifice form worship gods, others offer sacrifice sacrifice fire Brahman.   Some offer sacrifice sense hearing senses fires restraint; others sacrifice sound objects sense fires senses. The restraint senseshearing othersis one thing; directing legitimate objects, e.g. listening hymns praise god, another, although ultimately amount thing.   Others sacrifice activities senses vital energy yogic fire self-control kindled knowledge. That say, lose contemplation Supreme.   Some sacrifice material gifts; austerities; yoga; acquiring imparting knowledge. All sacrifices stern vows serious endeavour.   Others absorbed practices control vital energy sacrifice outward inward inward outward, check flow inward outward vital airs. The reference three kinds practices control vital energypuraka, rechaka, kumbhaka.   Yet others, abstemious food, sacrifice one form vital energy another. All know sacrifice purge impurities sacrifice.   Those partake residue sacrificecalled amrita (ambrosia)attain everlasting Brahman. Even world not non-sacrificer; next, O Kurusattama?   Even various sacrifices described Vedas; know proceed action; knowing thou shalt released. Action means mental, physical spiritual action. No sacrifice possible without triple action no salvation without sacrifice. To know put knowledge practice know secret sacrifice. In fine, unless man uses physical, mental spiritual gifts service mankind, thief unfit Freedom. He uses intellect spares body not full sacrificer. Unless mind body soul made work unison, cannot adequately used service mankind. Physical, mental spiritual purity essential harmonious working. Therefore man concentrate developing, purifying, turning best faculties.   Knowledge-sacrifice better, O-Parantapa, material sacrifice, action not bind finds consummation Knowledge (jnana). Who not know works charity performed without knowledge often result great harm? Unless every act, however nobel motive, informed knowledge, lacks perfection. Hence complete fulfillment action knowledge.   The masters knowledge seen Truth impart thee Knowledge; learn humble homage service repeated questioning. The three conditions knowledgehomage, repeated questioning servicedeserve carefully borne mind age. Homage obeisance means humility service necessary accompaniment; else would mock homage. Repeated questioning equally essential, without keen spirit inquiry, no knowledge. All presupposes devotion faith person approached. There no humility, much less service, without faith.   When thou hast gained knowledge, O Pandava, thou shalt not fall error; virtue thou shalt see beings without exception thyself Me. The adage Yatha pinde tatha brahmande'as self universe') means thing. He attained Self-realization sees no difference others.   Even though thou sinful sinners, thou shalt cross ocean sin boat knowledge.   As blazing fire turns fuel ashes, O Arjuna, even fire Knowledge turns actions ashes.   There nothing world purifying Knowledge. He perfected yoga finds fullness time.   It man faith gains knowledgethe man intent mastery senses; gained knowledge, comes ere long supreme peace.   But man doubt, without knowledge without faith, lost; given doubt neither world beyond, happiness.   He renounced action means yoga, severed doubt means knowledgehim self-possessed, no actions bind, O Dhananjaya!   Therefore, sword Self-realization sever thou doubt, bred ignorance, crept thy heart! Betake thyself yoga arise, O Bharata! Chapter_five  Thou laudest renunciation actions, O Krishna, whilst time thou laudest performance action; tell certainty better. The Lord Said:  Renunciation performance action lead salvation; two, karmayoga (performance) better sannyasa (renunciation).  Him one know ever renouncing no dislikes likes; free pairs opposites easily released bondage. That is, not renunciation action attachment pairs determines true renunciation. A man always action may good sannyasa (renouncer) another may no work may well hypocrite. See III.   It ignorant speak sankhya yoga different, not knowledge. He rightly established even one wins fruit both. The yogi engrossed sankhya (knowledge)lives even thought good world attains fruit karmayoga sheer power thought. The karmayogi ever engrossed unattached action naturally enjoys peace jnanayogi.  The goal sankhyas attain also reached yogins. He sees truly sees sankhya yoga one.  But renunciation, O Mahabahu, hard attain except yoga; ascetic equipped yoga attains Brahman ere long.  The yogi cleared himself, gained mastery mind senses, become one Atman creation, although acts remains unaffected.  The yogi seen Truth knows not acts whilst seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing,  Talking, letting go, holding fast, opening closing eyesin conviction senses moving respective spheres. So long self' endures, detachment cannot achieved. A sensual man therefore may not shelter pretence not senses acting. Such mischievous interpretation betrays gross ignorance Gita right conduct. The next shloka makes clear.   He dedicates actions Brahman performs without attachment not smeared sin, lotus-leaf water.   Only body, mind intellect also senses, yogins perform action without attachment sake self-purification.   A man yoga obtains everlasting peace abandoning fruit action; man ignorant yoga, selfishly attached fruit, remains bound.   Renouncing mind actions, dweller body, master himself, rests happily city nine gates, neither getting anything done. The principal gates body two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth, two organs excretionthough really speaking countless pores skin no less gates. If gatekeeper always remains alert performs task, letting objects deserve ingress egress, truly said no part ingress egress, passive witness. He nothing gets thing done.   The Lord creates neither agency action world; neither connect action fruit. It nature work. God no doer. The inexorable law karma prevails, fulfillment lawgiving everyone deserts, making everyone reap sowslies God's abounding mercy justice. In undiluted justice mercy. Mercy inconsistent justice not mercy opposite. But man not judge knowing past, present, future. So law reversed mercy forgiveness purest justice. Being ever liable judged must accord others would accord himself, viz. forgiveness. Only cultivating spirit forgiveness reach state yogi, no actions bind, man even-mindedness, man skilled action.   The Lord not take upon Himself anyone's vice virtue; ignorance veils knowledge deludes creatures. The delusion lies man arrogating authorship action attributing God consequences thereofpunishment reward case may be.   But whose ignorance destroyed knowledge Atman, knowledge, like sun, reveals Supreme.   Those whose intellect suffused That, whose self become one That, abide That, whose end aim that, wipe sins knowledge, go whence no return.   The men Self-realization look equal eye brahmana possessed learning humility, cow, elephant, dog even dog-eater. That say, serve every one alike, according needs each. Treating brahmana shwapaka (dog-eater) alike means wise man suck poison snake-bitten shwapaka much eagerness readiness would snake-bitten brahmana.   In body conquered round birth death, whose mind anchored sameness; perfect Brahman all, therefore Brahman rest. As man thinks, becomes, therefore whose minds bent achieve sameness become one Brahman.   He whose understanding secure, undeluded, knows Brahman rests Brahman, neither glad get pleasant, sad get unpleasant.   He detached contacts without, finds bliss Atman; achieved union Brahman enjoys eternal bliss. He weaned outward objects inner Atman fitted union Brahman highest bliss. To withdraw oneself contacts without bask sunshine union Brahman two aspects state, two sides coin.   For joys derived sense-contacts nothing mines misery; beginning end, O Kaunteya; wise man not revel therein.   The man able even earth, ere released body, hold floodtide lust wrath,he yogi, happy. As corpse no likes dislikes, no sensibility pleasure pain, even though alive dead these, truly lives, truly happy.   He finds happiness within, rest within, light within,that yogi, become one nature, attains oneness Brahman.   They win oneness Brahmanthe seers whose sins wiped out, whose doubts resolved, mastered themselves, engrossed welfare beings.   Rid lust wrath, masters themselves, ascetics realized Atman find oneness Brahman everywhere around them.   -  That ascetic ever freewho, shut outward sense-contacts, sits gaze fixed brows, outward inward breathing nostrils made equal; senses, mind, reason held check; rid longing, fear wrath; intent Freedom. These shlokas refer yogic practices laid Yoga-sutras. A word caution necessary regarding practices. They serve yogin purpose athletics gymnastics bhogin (who pursues worldly pleasures). His physical exercises help latter keep senses enjoyment full vigour. The yogic practices help yogin keep body condition senses subjection. Men versed practices rare days, turn good account. He achieved preliminary stage path self-discipline, passion Freedom, rid pairs opposites conquered fear, would well go practices surely help him. It disciplined man alone can, practices, render body holy temple God. Purity mind body sine qua non, without processes likely, first instance, lead man astray drive deeper slough delusion. That result cases many know actual experience. That prince yogins, Patanjali gave first place yamas (cardinal vows) niyamas (casual vows), held eligible yogic practices gone preliminary discipline. The five cardinal vows are: non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy, non-possession. The five casual vows are: bodily purity, contentment, study scriptures, austerity, meditation God.   Knowing Me Acceptor sacrifice austerity, great Lord worlds, Friend creation, yogi attains peace. Chapter_six  He performs obligatory action, without depending fruit thereof, sannyasin yoginnot man neglects sacrificial fire neglects action. Fire may taken mean possible instruments action. Fire needed sacrifices used performed help. Assuming spinning means universal service age, man neglecting spinning wheel would not become sannyasi.  What called sannyasa, know thou yoga, O Pandava; none become yogin not renounced selfish purpose.  For man seeks scale heights yoga, action said means; man, scaled heights, repose said means. He purged impurities achieved even-mindedness easily achieve Self-realization. But not mean scaled heights yoga disdain work guidance world. On contrary work not breath nostrils, also natural breathing. He sheer force will. See V.   When man not attached either objects sense actions sheds selfish purpose, said scaled heights yoga.  By one's Self one raise oneself, not allow oneself fall; Atman (Self) alone friend self, Self alone self's foe.  His Self alone friend, conquered Self: not conquered inimical himself, even Self behaves foe.  Of conquered rests perfect calm self completely composed, cold heat, pleasure pain, honour dishonour.  The yogin filled contentment wisdom discriminative knowledge, firm rock, mastered senses, clod earth, stone gold same, possessed yoga.  He excels regards alike boon companion, friend, enemy, stranger, mediator, alien ally, also saint sinner.   Let yogi constantly apply thought Atman remaining alone scheduled place, mind body control, rid desires possessions.   Fixing himself, pure spot, firm seat, neither high yet low, covered kusha grass, thereon deerskin, thereon cloth;   Sitting seat, mind concentrated, functions thought sense control, set practice yoga sake self-purification.   Keeping steady, holding trunk, neck head straight line motionless, fixing eye tip nose, looking not around.   Tranquil spirit, free fear, steadfast vow brahmacharya, holding mind control, yogi sit, thoughts Me, absorbed Me. Brahmacharya (usually translated celibacy') means not sexual continence observance cardinal vows attainment Brahman.   The yogi, ever thus, mind controlled, unites Atman, wins peace culminates Nirvana, peace Me.   Yoga not eats much, fasts much, neither sleeps much, yet wakeful.   To disciplined food recreation, effort activities, sleep waking, yoga (discipline) becomes relief ills.   When one's thought, completely controlled, rests steadily Atman, one free longing objects desire, one called yogin.   As taper windless spot flickers not, even yogin, thought controlled, seeking unite Atman.   Where thought curbed practice yoga completely ceases, man sits content within himself, Atman seen Atman;   Where experiences endless bliss beyond senses grasped reason alone; wherein established swerves not Truth;   Where holds no gain greater gained; where, securely seated, not shaken calamity however great;   That state known yoga (union Supreme), disunion union pain. This yoga must one practice firm resolve unwearying zeal.   Shaking oneself completely free longings born selfish purpose; reining whole host senses, sides, mind itself;   With reason held securely will, gradually attain calm mind established Atman think nothing.   Wherever fickle unsteady mind wanders, thence reined brought sole sway Atman.   The yogin, cleansed stain, unites ever Atman, easily enjoys endless bliss contact Brahman.   The man equipped yoga looks impartial eye, seeing Atman beings beings Atman.   He sees Me everywhere everything Me, never vanishes Me I him.   The yogin who, anchored unity, worships Me abiding beings, lives moves me, no matter live move. So long self' subsists, Supreme Self absent; self' extinguished, Supreme Self seen everywhere. Also see note XIII.     He who, likening others, senses pleasure pain equally himself, deemed highest yogi, O Arjuna. Arjuna Said:   I not see, O Madhusudana, yoga, based equal-mindedness Thou hast expounded me, steadily endure, fickleness (of mind).   For fickle mind, O Krishna, unruly, overpowering stubborn; curb is, I think, hard curb wind. The Lord Said:   Undoubtedly, O Mahabahu, mind fickle hard curb; yet, O Kaunteya, held check constant practice dispassion.   Without self-restraint, yoga, I hold, difficult attain; self-governed soul attain proper means, strives it. Arjuna Said:   If one, possessed faith, slack effort, mind straying yoga, reach not perfection yoga, end come to, O Krishna?   Without foothold, floundering path Brahman fallen both, indeed not lost, O Mahabahu, like dissipated cloud?   This doubt, O Krishna, thou dispel utterly; found none thou banish doubt. The Lord Said:   Neither world, next, ruin him, O Partha; no well-doer, oh loved one, meets sad end.   Fallen yoga, man attains worlds righteous souls, dwelt numberless years born house pure gentle blood.   Or may even born family yogins, though birth rare world.   There, O Kurunandana, discovers intellectual stage reached previous birth, thence stretches forward towards perfection.   By virtue previous practice borne on, whether not, even desire know yoga passes beyond Vedic ritual.   But yogi perseveres striving, cleansed sin, perfected many births, reaches highest state.   The yogin deemed higher man austerities; deemed also higher man knowledge; higher man engrossed ritual; therefore thou yogin, O Arjuna!   And among yogins, worships Me faith, inmost self rapt Me, deemed best yogin. Chapter_seven  Hear, O Partha, how, thy mind rivetted me, practicing yoga making sole refuge, thou shalt, without doubt, know fully.  I declare thee, entirety, knowledge, combined discriminative knowledge, thou hast known remains nothing known.  Among thousands men hardly one strives perfection; among strive hardly one knows Me truth.  Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether, Mind, Reason Egothus eightfold prakriti divided. The eightfold prakriti substantially field described XIII.   perishable Being XV.    This My lower aspect; know thou My aspect, higherwhich Jiva (the Vital Essence) which, O Mahabahu, world sustained.  Know two compose source beings spring; I origin end entire universe.  There nothing higher I, O Dhananjaya; strung Me row gems upon thread.  In water I savour, O Kaunteya; sun moon I light; syllable AUM Vedas; sound ether, manliness men.  I sweet fragrance earth; brilliance fire; life beings; austerity ascetics.   Know Me, O Partha, primeval seed beings; I reason rational beings splendour splendid.   Of strong, I strength, divorced lust passion; beings I desire undivorced righteousness.   Know manifestations three gunas, sattva, rajas, tamas, proceed none Me; yet I not them; Me. God not dependent them, dependent Him. Without Him various manifestations would impossible.   Befogged manifestations three gunas, entire world fails recognize Me, imperishable, transcending them.   For My divine delusive mystery made three gunas hard pierce; make Me sole refuge pierce veil.   The deluded evil-doers, lowest men, not see refuge Me; for, reason delusive mystery, bereft knowledge given devilish ways.   Four types well-doers devoted Me, O Arjuna; are, O Bharatarshabha, afflicted, spiritual seeker, material seeker, enlightened.   Of enlightened, ever attached Me single-minded devotion, best; enlightened I exceedingly dear dear Me.   All estimable indeed, enlightened I hold My self; he, true yogi, stayed Me alone, supreme goal.   At end many births enlightened man finds refuge Me; rare indeed great soul Vasudeva all'.   Men, bereft knowledge reason various longings, seek refuge gods, pinning faith diverse rites, guided nature.   Whatever form one desires worship faith devotion, form I make faith secure.   Possessed faith seeks propitiate one, obtains therethrough longings, dispensed truth none Me.   But limited fruit falls shortsighted ones; worship gods go gods, worship Me come unto Me.   Not knowing My transcendent, imperishable, supreme character, undiscerning think Me unmanifest become manifest.   Veiled delusive mystery created My unique power, I not manifest all; bewildered world not recognize Me, birthless changeless. Having power create world sense yet unaffected it, He described unique power.   I know, O Arjuna, creatures past, present be; no one knows Me.   All creatures universe bewildered, O Parantapa, virtue delusion pairs opposite sprung likes dislikes, O Bharata.   But virtuous men whose sin come end, freed delusion pairs opposites, worship Me steadfast faith.   Those endeavour freedom age death taking refuge Me, know full Brahman, Adhyatma Karma.   Those know Me, including Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, Adhiyajna, possessed even-mindedness, know Me even time passing away. Chapter_eight  What Brahman? What Adhyatma? What Karma, O Purushottama? What called Adhibhuta? And Adhidaiva?  And body Adhiyajna how? And time death art Thou known self-controlled? The Lord Said:  The Supreme, Imperishable Brahman; manifestation Adhyatma; creative process whereby beings created called Karma.  Adhibhuta My perishable form; Adhidaivata individual self form; O best among embodied, Adhiyajna I body, purified sacrifice. That is, Imperishable Unmanifest perishable atom everything universe Supreme expression Supreme. Why mortal man arrogate authorship anything rather His bidding dedicate action Him?  And who, last hour remembering Me only, departs leaving body, enters Me; no doubt.  Or whatever form man continually contemplates, remembers hour death, form goes, O Kaunteya.  Therefore times remember Me fight on; thy mind reason Me fixed thou shalt surely come Me.  With thought steadied constant practice, wandering nowhere, meditates Supreme Celestial Being, O Partha, goes Him.  -  Whoso, time death, unwavering mind, devotion, fixing breath rightly brows power yoga, meditates Sage, Ancient, Ruler, subtler subtlest, Supporter all, Inconceivable, glorious sun beyond darkness,he goes Supreme Celestial Being.   That knowers Vedas call Imperishable (or word knowers Vedas repeat), wherein ascetics freed passion enter desiring practice brahmacharya, Goal (or Word) I declare thee brief.   Closing gates, locking mind hridaya, fixing breath within head, rapt yogic meditation;   Whoso departs leaving body uttering AUMBrahman one syllablerepeatedly thinking Me, reaches highest state.   That yogi easily wins Me, O Partha, who, ever attached Me, constantly remembers Me undivided mind.   Great souls, come Me, reach highest perfection; come not birth, unlasting (withal) abode misery.   From world Brahma down, worlds subject return, O Arjuna; coming Me no rebirth.   Those men indeed know Day Night, know Brahma's day lasts thousand yugas night thousand yugas long. That say, day night dozen hours less infinitesimal fraction moment vast cycle time. Pleasures pursued incalculably small moments illusory mirage. Rather waste brief moments, devote serving God service mankind. On hand, time small drop ocean eternity fail object here, viz. Self-realization, need not despair. She bide time.   At coming Day manifest spring forth Unmanifest, coming Night dissolved Unmanifest. Knowing too, man understand little power things, round birth death ceaseless.   This multitude creatures come birth, O Partha, again; dissolved coming Night, whether not; break Day re-born.   But higher Unmanifest another Unmanifest Being, everlasting, perisheth not creatures perish.   This Unmanifest, named Imperishable, declared highest goal. For reach no return. That highest abode.   This Supreme Being, O Partha, may undivided devotion; It beings dwell, It pervaded.   Now I tell thee, Bharatarshabha, conditions determine exemption return, also return, yogins pass away hence.   Fire, Light, Day, Bright Fortnight, six months Northern Solsticethrough departing men knowing Brahman go Brahman.   Smoke, Night, Dark Fortnight, six months Southern SolsticeTherethrough yogin attains lunar light thence returns. I not understand meaning two shlokas. They not seem consistent teaching Gita. The Gita teaches whose heart meek devotion, devoted unattached action seen Truth must win salvation, no matter dies. These shlokas seem run counter this. They may perhaps stretched mean broadly man sacrifice, man light, man known Brahman finds release birth retains enlightenment time death, contrary man none attributes goes world moonnot lastingand returns birth. The moon, all, shines borrowed light.   These two pathsbright darkare deemed eternal paths world; one man goes return not, returns again. The Bright one may taken mean path knowledge dark one ignorance.   The Yogin knowing two paths falls not delusion, O Partha; therefore, times, O Arjuna, remain steadfast yoga. \"Will not fall delusion\" means knows two paths known secret even-mindedness not take path ignorance.   Whatever fruit good deeds laid accruing (a study of) Vedas, sacrifices, austerities, acts charityall yogin transcends, knowing this, reaches Supreme Primal Abode. He achieved even-mindedness dint devotion, knowledge service not obtains fruit good actions, also wins salvation. Chapter_nine  I declare thee, art uncensorious, mysterious knowledge, together discriminative knowledge, knowing thou shalt released ill.  This king sciences, king mysteries, pure sovereign, capable direct comprehension, essence dharma, easy practice, changeless.  Men no faith doctrine, O Parantapa, far coming Me, return repeatedly path world death.  By Me, unmanifest form, whole world pervaded; beings Me, I not them.  And yet beings not Me. That indeed My unique power Lord! Sustainer beings, I not them; My Self brings existence. The sovereign power God lies mystery, miracle, beings Him yet not Him, He yet not them. This description God language mortal man. Indeed He soothes man revealing His aspects using kinds paradoxes. All beings inasmuch creation His; He transcends all, He really not author all, may said equal truth beings not Him. He really His true devotees, He not, according them, deny Him. What not mystery, miracle God?  As mighty wind, moving everywhere, ever contained ether, even know beings contained Me.  All beings, O Kaunteya, merge prakriti, end kalpa, I send forth kalpa begins.  Resorting prakriti, I send forth multitude beings, powerless sway prakriti.  But activity, O Dhananjaya, not bind Me, seated one indifferent, unattached it.   With Presiding Witness, prakriti gives birth moves not move; this, O Kaunteya, wheel world keeps going.   Not knowing My transcendent nature sovereign Lord beings, fools condemn Me incarnated man. For deny existence God not recognize Director human body.   Vain hopes, actions knowledge witless ones resorted delusive nature monsters devils.   But great souls resort divine nature, O Partha, know Me Imperishable Source beings worship Me undivided mind.   Always declaring My glory, striving steadfast faith, Me devout homage; ever attached Me, worship Me.   Yet others, knowledge-sacrifice, worship Me, seen everywhere, one, different many.   I sacrificial vow; I sacrifice; I ancestral oblation; I herb; I sacred text; I clarified butter; I fire; I burnt offering.   Of universe I Father, Mother, Creator, Grandsire: I known, sacred syllable AUM; rig, Saman Yajus;   I Goal, Sustainer, Lord, Witness, Abode, Refuge, Friend; Origin, End Preservation, Treasurehouse, Imperishable Seed.   I give heat; I hold back pour forth rain; I deathlessness also death. O Arjuna, Being not-Being well.   Followers three Vedas, drink soma juice purged sin, worship Me sacrifice pray going heaven; reach holy world gods enjoy heaven divine joys gods. The reference sacrificial ceremonies rites vogue days Gita. We cannot definitely say like soma juice exactly was.   They enjoy vast world heaven, merit spent, enter world mortals; who, following Vedic law, long fruit action earn round birth death.   As worship Me, thinking Me alone nothing else, ever attached Me, I bear burden getting need. There three unmistakable marks true yogi bhaktaeven-mindedness, skill action, undivided devotion. These three must completely harmonized yogi. Without devotion no even-mindedness, without even-mindedness no devotion, without skill action devotion even-minded might well pretense.   Even who, devoted gods, worship full faith, even they, O Kaunteya, worship none Me, though not according rule. Not according rule' means not knowing Me Impersonal Absolute.   For I Acceptor Director sacrifices; not recognizing Me I am, go astray.   Those worship gods go gods; worship manes go manes; worship spirits go spirits; worship Me come Me.   Any offering leaf, flower, fruit water, made Me devotion, earnest soul, I lovingly accept. That say, Lord every serve devotion accepts service.   Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest sacrifice gift, whatever austerity thou dost perform, O kaunteya, dedicate Me.   So thou shalt released bondage action, yielding good evil fruit; accomplished renunciation performance, thou shalt released (from birth death) come unto Me.   I beings; Me non disfavoured, none favoured; worship Me devotion Me I them.   A sinner, howsoever great, turns Me undivided devotion, must indeed counted saint; settled resolve. The undivided devotion subdues passions evil deeds.   For soon becomes righteous wins everlasting peace; know certainty, O kaunteya, bhakta never perishes.   For finding refuge Me, even though born womb sin, women, vaishyas, shudras too, reach supreme goal.   How much then, pure brahmanas seer-kings devotees? Do thou worship Me, therefore, since thou hast come fleeting joyless world.   On Me fix thy mind, Me bring thy devotion, Me offer thy sacrifice, Me make thy obeisance; attached thyself Me made Me thy end aim, Me indeed shalt thou come. Chapter_ten  Yet more, O Mahabahu, My supreme word, I utter thee, gratified one, thy benefit.  Neither gods great seers know My origin; I am, every way, origin both.  He knows Me, great lord worlds, birthless without beginning, among mortals, undeluded, released sins.  Discernment, knowledge, freedom delusion, long suffering, truth, self-restraint, inward calm, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear fearlessness;  Non-violence, even-mindedness, contentment, austerity, beneficence, good ill fame,all various attributes creatures proceed verily Me.  The seven great seers, ancient four, Manus born Me My mind, born creatures world.  He knows truth My immanence My yoga becomes gifted unshakable yoga; no doubt.  I source all, proceeds me; knowing this, wise worship Me hearts full devotion.  With thoughts, whole soul devoted Me, teaching one another, ever lips, live contentment joy.   To these, ever tune Me worshipping affectionate devotion, I give power selfless action, whereby come Me.   Out every compassion them, I dwell hearts, destroy darkness, born ignorance, refulgent lamp knowledge. Arjuna Said:   Lord! Thou art supreme Brahman, supreme Abode, supreme Purifier! Everlasting Celestial Being, Primal God, Unborn, All-pervading.   Thus seersthe divine seer Narada, Asita, Devala, Vyasadeclared Thee; Thou Thyself dost tell so.   All Thou tellest true, I know, O Keshava, verily, Lord, neither gods demons know Thy manifestation.   Thyself alone Thou knowest Thyself, O Purushottama, O Source Lord beings, God Gods, O Ruler universe.   Indeed Thou oughtest tell Thy manifestations, without remainder, whereby Thou dost pervade worlds.   O Yogin! constantly meditating Thee, I know Thee? In various aspects I think Thee, O Lord?   Recount yet again, full detail, Thy unique power Thy immanence, O Janardana! For ears cannot sated listening Thy life-giving words. The Lord Said:   Yea, I unfold thee, O Kurushreshtha, My divine manifestations,the chiefest only; no limit extent.   I Atman, O Gudakesha, seated heart every being; I beginning, middle end beings.   Of Adityas I Vishnu; luminaries, radiant Sun; Maruts, I Marichi; constellations, moon.   Of Vedas I Sama Veda; gods Indra; senses I mind; beings I consciousness.   Of Rudras I Shankara; Yakshas Rakshasas Kubera; Vasus I Fire; mountains Meru.   Of priests, O Partha, know Me chief Brihaspati; army captains I Kartikeya; waters ocean.   Of great seers I Bhrigu; words I one syllable AUM'; sacrifices I Japa sacrifice; things immovable, Himalaya.   Of trees I Ashvattha; divine seers, Narada; heavenly choir I Chitraratha; perfected I Kapila ascetic.   Of horses, Know Me Uchchaihshravas born Amrita; mighty elephants I Airavata; men, monarch.   Of weapons, I Vajra; cows, Kamadhenu; I Kandarpa, god generation; serpants I Vasuki.   Of cobras I Anata; water-dwellers I Varuna; manes I Aryaman; chastisers, Yama.   Of demons I Prahlada; reckoners, time; beasts I lion; birds, Garuda.   Of cleansing agents I Wind; wielders weapons, Rama; fishes I crocodile; rivers Ganges.   Of creations I beginning, end middle, O Arjuna; sciences, science spiritual knowledge; debators, right argument.   Of letters, letter A; compounds I dvandva; I imperishable Time; I creator seen everywhere.   All-seizing Death I, source things be; feminine virtues I Kirti (glory), Shri (beauty), Vak (speech), Smriti (memory), Medha (intelligence), Dhriti (constancy) Kshama (forgiveness).   Of Saman hymns I Brihat Saman; metres, Gayatri; months I Margashirsha; seasons, spring.   Of deceivers I dice-play; splendid splendour; I victory, I resolution, I goodness good. The dice-play deceivers' need not alarm one. For good evil nature things not matter question, directing immanent power God described. Let deceivers also know God's rule judgment put away pride deceit.   Of Vrishnis I Vasudeva; Pandavas Dhananjaya; ascetics I Vyasa; seers, Ushanas.   I rod punish; strategy seeking victory; secret things I silence, knowledge know.   Whatever seed every being, O Arjuna, I; nothing, whether moving fixed, without Me.   no end divine manifestations; extent I told thee way illustration.   Whatever glorious, beautiful mighty know thou issued fragment My splendour.   But needest thou learn great length, O Arjuna? With part Myself I stand upholding universe. Chapter_eleven  Out Thy grace towards me, thou hast told supreme mystery revealing knowledge Supreme; banished delusion.  Of origin destruction beings I heard Thee full detail, also Thy imperishable ajesty [sic], O Kamala-patraksha!  Thou art indeed Thou hast described Thyself, Parameshvara! I crave behold, now, form Thine Ishvara.  If, Lord, thou thinkest possible bear sight, reveal me, O Yogeshvara, Thy imperishable form. The Lord Said:  Behold, O Partha, forms divine hundreds thousands, infinitely diverse, infinitely various color aspect.  Behold Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, two Ashwins, Maruts; behold, O Bharata, numerous marvels never revealed before.  Behold today, O Gudakesha, body, whole universe, moving unmoving, one, whatever else thou cravest see.  But thou canst not see Me thine eyes. I give thee eye divine; behold My sovereign power! Sanjaya Said:  With words, O King, great Lord Yoga, Hari, revealed Partha His supreme form Ishvara.   With many mouths many eyes, many wondrous aspects, many divine ornaments, many brandished weapons divine.   Wearing divine garlands vestments, annointed divine perfumes, form God, all-marvellous [sic], infinite, seen everywhere.   Were splendour thousand suns shoot forth sky might perchance resemble splendour Mighty One.   Then Pandava see whole universe manifold divisions gathered one body God gods.   Then Dhananjaya, wonderstruck thrilled every fibre being, bowed low head Lord, addressing Him folded hands. Arjuna Said:   With Thy form, O Lord, I see gods diverse multitudes beings, Lord Brahma, lotus-throne seers serpents divine.   With many arms bellies, mouths eyes, I see Thy infinite form everywhere. Neither Thy end, middle, beginning, I see, O Lord Universe, Universal-formed!   With crown mace disc, mass effulgence, gleaming everywhere I see Thee, dazzling sight, bright splendour fiery sun blazing sides,incomprehensible.   Thou art Supreme Imperishable worthy known; Thou art final resting place universe; Thou art changeless guardian Eternal Dharma; Thou art, I believe, Everlasting Being.   Thou hast no beginning, middle end; infinite Thy might; arms innumerable; eyes, sun moon; Thy mouth blazing fire, overpowering universe Thy radiance.   By Thee alone filled spaces heaven earth quarters; sight Thy wondrous terrible form, three worlds sore oppressed, O Mahatman!   Here, too, multitudes gods seen enter Thee; awe-struck praise Thee folded arms; hosts great seers siddhas, All Hail' lips, hymn Thee songs praise.   The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, gods, twin Ashwins, Maruts, Manes, hosts Gandharvas, Yakshas, Asuras Siddhasall gaze Thee wonderment.   At sight thy mighty form, O Mahabahu, many-mouthed, eyes, arms, thighs feet innumerable, many vast bellies, terrible many jaws, worlds feel fearfully oppressed, I.   For I behold Thee touching sky, glowing, numerous-hued gaping mouths wide resplendent eyes, I feel oppressed innermost being; no peace quiet I find, O Vishnu!   As I see Thy mouths fearful jaws, resembling Fire Doom, I lose sense direction, find no relief. Be gracious, O Devesha, O Jagannivasa!   All sons Dhritarashtra, crowd kings, Bhishma, Drona, Karna too, also chief warriors   Are hastening fearful jaws Thy terrible mouths. Some indeed, caught Thy teeth, seen, heads crushed atoms.   As rivers, numerous torrents, run head-long sea, even heroes world men rush Thy flaming mouths.   As moths, fast-flying, plunge blazing fire, straight doom, even rush headlong Thy mouths, destruction.   Devouring sides, Thou lappest Thy flaming tongues; Thy fierce rays blaze forth, filling whole universe lustre.   Tell me, Lord, Thou art dread form! Hail Thee, O Devavara! Be gracious! I desire know Thee, Primal Lord; I comprehend not Thou dost. The Lord Said:   Doom I, full-ripe, dealing death worlds, engaged devouring mankind. Even without slaying not one warriors, ranged battle thee, survive.   Therefore, thou arise, win renown! Defeat thy foes enjoy thriving kingdom. By Me already destroyed; thou no instrument, O Savyasachin!   Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha Karna, also warrior chiefsalready slain Meslay thou! Fight! Victory thine foes field. Sanjaya Said:   Hearing world Keshava, crown-wearer Arjuna folded hands, trembling made obeisance. Bowing hesitant, faltering accents, proceeded address Krishna more. Arjuna Said:   Right proper is, O Hrishikesha, Thy praise stir world gladness tender emotion; Rakshasas fear fly every quarter hosts Siddhas reverent homage.   And not bow Thee, O Mahatma? Thou art First Creator, greater even Brahma. O Ananta, O Devesha, O Jagannivasa, Thou art Imperishable, Being, not-Being, That transcends even these.   Thou art Primal God, Ancient Being; Thou art Final Resting Place Universe; Thou art Knower, to-be-known', Supreme Abode; Thee, O Myriad-formed, universe pervaded.   Thou art Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, Shashanka, Prajapati, Prapitamaha! All Hail Thee, thousand times hail! Again yet hail Thee!   All hail Thee behind! hail Thee every side, O All; Thy prowess infinite, Thy might measureless! Thou holdest all; therefore Thou art all.   If ever carelessness, thinking Thee comrade, I addressed Thee saying, O Krishna!', O Yadava!' not knowing Thy greatness, negligence affection,   If ever I rude Thee jest, whilst play, rest-time, meals, whilst alone company, O Achyuta, forgive Thou faultI beg Thee, O Incomprehensible!   Thou art Father world, moving un-moving; thou art adored, worthiest, Master; none equal Thee; greater Thee? Thy power matchless three worlds.   Therefore, I prostrate Thee, beseech Thy grace, O Lord adorable! As father son, comrade comrade, shouldst Thou bear, beloved Lord, me, Thy loved one.   I filled joy see never seen before, yet heart oppressed fear. Show original form Thine, O Lord! Be gracious, Devesha, O Jagannivasa!   I crave see Thee even Thou wast, crown, mace, disc hand; wear Thou, more, four-armed form, O thousand-armed Vishvamurti! The Lord Said:   It favour thee, O Arjuna, I revealed thee, My unique power, My form Supreme, Resplendent, Universal, Infinite, Primalwhich none save thee ever seen.   Not study Vedas, not sacrifice, not study scriptures, not gifts, yet performance rites fierce austerities I, form, seen one save thee world men, O Kurupravira!   Be thou neither oppressed bewildered look awful form Mine. Banish thy fear, ease thy mind, lo! behold Me I was. Sanjaya Said.   So said Vasudeva Arjuna, revealed His original form. Wearing His form benign, Mahatma consoled terrified. Arjuna Said.   Beholding thy benign human form I come normal state. The Lord Said:   Very hard behold form Mine thou hast seen; even gods always yearn see it.   Not Vedas, not penance, gifts, yet sacrifice, behold Me form thou hast seen.   But single-minded devotion, O Arjuna, I may form known seen, truly entered into, O Parantapa!   He alone comes me, O Pandava, My work, made Me goal, My devotee, renounced attachment, ill-will toward none. Chapter_twelve  Of devotees worship Thee, incessantly attached, worship Imperishable Unmanifest, better yogins? The Lord Said:  Those I regard best yogins who, riveting minds Me, ever attached, worship Me, highest faith.  But worship Imperishable, indefinable, Unmanifest, Omnipresent, Unthinkable, Rock-seated, Immovable, Unchanging,  Keeping whole host senses complete control, looking impartial eye, engrossed welfare beingsthese come indeed Me.  Greater travail whose mind fixed Unmanifest; hard embodied mortals gain UnmanifestGoal. Mortal man imagine Unmanifest, Impersonal, language fails often negatively describes It Neti', Neti' (Not That, Not That). And even iconoclasts bottom no better idol-worshippers. To worship book, go church, pray one's face particular directionall forms worshipping Formless image idol. And yet, idol-breaker idol-worshipper cannot lose sight fact something beyond form, Unthinkable, Formless, Impersonal, Changeless. The highest goal devotee become one object devotion. The bhakta extinguishes merges into, becomes, Bhagvan. This state best reached devoting oneself form, said short cut Unmanifest really longest difficult.  But casting actions Me, making Me all, worship Me meditation undivided devotion,  Of such, whose thoughts centered Me, O Partha, I become ere long Deliverer ocean world death.  On Me set thy mind, Me rest thy conviction; without doubt shalt thou remain Me hereafter.  If thou canst not set thy mind steadily Me, method constant practice seek win Me, O Dhananjaya.   If thou art also unequal method constant practice, concentrate service Me; even serving Me thou shalt attain perfection.   If thou art unable even this, dedicating Me, mind controlled, abandon fruit action.   Better knowledge practice, better knowledge concentration, better concentration renunciation fruit action, directly issues peace. Practice' (abhyasa) practice yoga meditation control psychic processes; knowledge' (jnana) intellectual effort; concentration' (dhyana) devoted worship. If result no renunciation fruit action, practice' no practice', knowledge' no knowledge', concentration' no concentration'.   Who ill-will towards none, friendly compassionate, shed thought mine' I', regards pain pleasure alike, long-suffering;   Who ever content, gifted yoga, self-restrained, firm conviction, dedicated mind reason Methat devotee (bhakta) Mine dear Me.   Who gives no trouble world, world causes no trouble, free exultation, resentment, fear vexation,that man dear Me.   Who expects naught, pure, resourceful, unconcerned, untroubled, indulges no undertakings,that devotee Mine dear Me.   Who rejoices not, neither frets grieves, covets not, abandons good illthat devotee Mine dear Me.   Who foe friend, regards alike respect disrespect, cold heat, pleasure pain, free attachment;   Who weighs equal scale blame praise, silent, content whatever lot, owns no home, steady mind,that devotee Mine dear Me.   They follow essence dharma, I told it, faith, keeping Me goal,those devotees exceeding dear Me. Chapter_thirteen  This body, O Kaunteya, called Field; knows called knower Field know.  And understand Me be, O Bharata, knower Field Fields; knowledge Field knower Field, I hold, true knowledge.  What Field is, nature, modifications, whence what, also He is, His powerhear briefly Me.  This subject sung seers distinctively various ways, different hymns also aphoristic texts Brahman well reasoned unequivocal.  The great elements, Individuation, Reason, Unmanifest, ten senses, one (mind), five spheres senses;  Desire, dislike, pleasure, pain, association, consciousness, cohesionthis, sum, called Field modifications. The great elements Earth, Water, Fire, Air Ether. Individuation' thought I, body I'; Unmanifest' prakriti maya; ten senses five senses perceptionsmell, taste, sight, touch hearing, five organs action, viz.: hands, feet, tongue, two organs excretion. The five spheres objects senses smell, savour, form, touch, sound. Association' property different organs co-operate. Dhriti not patience constancy cohesion, i.e. property atoms body hold together; individuation' springs cohesion. Individuation inherent unmanifest prakriti. The undeluded man cast individuation ego, done shock inevitable thing like death pairs opposites caused sense-contacts fail affect him. The Field, subject modifications, abandoned end enlightened unenlightened alike.  Freedom pride pretentiousness, nonviolence, forgiveness, uprightness, service Master, purity, steadfastenes, self-restraint;  Aversion sense-objects, absence conceit, realization painfulness evil birth, death, age disease;  Absence attachment, refusal wrapped one's children, wife, home family, even-mindedness whether good ill befall;   Unwavering all-exclusive devotion Me, resort secluded spots, distaste haunts men;   Settled conviction nature Atman, perception goal knowledge Truth, All declared Knowledge reverse ignorance.   I (now) expound thee known knowing one enjoys immortality; supreme Brahman no beginning, called neither Being non-Being. The Supreme described neither Being non-Being. It beyond definition description, attributes.   Everywhere hands feet, everywhere eyes, heads, mouths, everywhere ears, It abides embracing everything universe.   Seeming possess functions senses, It devoid senses; It touches naught, upholds all; no gunas, It experiences gunas.   Without beings, yet within; immovable yet moving, subtle It cannot perceived; far yet near It is. He knows It within It, close It; mobility immobility, peace restlessness, owe It, It motion yet motionless.   Undivided, It seems subsist divided beings; BrahmanThat known Sustainer all, yet It Devourer Creator.   Light lights, It said beyond darkness; It knowledge, object knowledge, gained knowledge; It seated hearts all.   Thus I expounded brief Field, Knowledge That known; My devotee, knows this, worthy become one Me.   Know Prakriti Purusha without beginning; know modifications gunas born Prakriti.   Prakriti described cause creation effects causes; Purusha described cause experiencing pleasure pain.   For Purusha, residing Prakriti, experiences gunas born Prakriti; attachment gunas cause birth good evil wombs. Prakriti common parlance Maya. Purusha Jiva. Jiva acting accordance nature experiences fruit actions arising three gunas.   What called body Witness, Assentor, Sustainer, Experiencer, Great Lord also Supreme Atman, Supreme Being.   He knows Purusha Prakriti gunas, not born again, no matter live move.   Some meditation hold Atman self; others Sankhya Yoga, others Karma Yoga.   Yet others, not knowing (Him) thus, worship (Him) heard others; pass beyond death, devoted adherence heard.   Wherever something born, animate inanimate, know thou Bharatarshabha, issues union Field Knower Field.   Who sees abiding beings Parameshvara, imperishable perishable, sees indeed.   When sees Ishvara abiding everywhere alike, not hurt hence attains highest goal. He sees God everywhere merges Him sees naught else; not yield passion, not become foe attains Freedom.   Who sees Prakriti performs actions (knows) Atman performs not, sees indeed. Just as, case man asleep, \"Self\" not agent sleep, Prakriti, even enlightened man detach \"Self\" activities. pure everything pure. Prakriti not unchaste, arrogant man takes wife twain passion born.   When sees diversity beings founded unity whole expanse issuing therefrom, attains Brahman. To realize everything rests Brahman attain state Brahman. Then Jiva becomes Shiva.   This imperishable Supreme Atman, O Kaunteya, though residing body, acts not not stained, no beginning no gunas.   As all-pervading ether, reason subtlety, not soiled even Atman pervading every part body not soiled.   As one Sun illumines whole universe, even Master Field illumines whole field, O Bharata!   Those who, eyes knowledge, perceive distinction Field Knower Field, (the secret) release beings Prakriti, attain Supreme. Chapter_fourteen  Yet I expound highest best knowledge, knowing sages passed hence highest perfection.  By recourse knowledge became one Me. They need not come birth even creation, suffer dissolution.  The great prakriti womb I deposit germ; beings come birth, O Bharata.  Whatever forms take birth various species, great prakriti Mother I seed-giving Father.  Sattva, rajas tamas gunas sprung prakriti; they, O Mahabahu, keep imperishable Dweller bound body.  Of sattva, stainless, light-giving healing; binds bond happiness bond knowledge, O sinless one.  Rajas, know thou, nature passion, source thirst attachment; keeps man bound bond action.  Tamas, know thou, born ignorance, mortal man's delusion; keeps bound heedlessness, sloth slumber, O Bharata.  Sattva attaches man happiness, rajas action, tamas, shrouding knowledge, attaches heedlessness.   Sattva prevails, O Bharata, overcome rajas tamas; rajas, overpowered sattva tamas; likewise tamas reigns sattva rajas crushed.   When lightknowledgeshines forth al gates body, may known sattva thrives.   Greed, activity, assumption undertakings, restlessness, cravingthese evidence rajas flourishes, O Bharatarshabha.   Ignorance, dullness, heedlessness, delusionthese evidence tamas reigns, O Kurunandana.   If embodied one meets end whilst sattva prevails, attains spotless worlds knowers Highest.   If dies reign within rajas, born among men attached action; dies tamas, born species not endowed reason.   The fruit sattvika action said stainless merit. That rajas pain tamas ignorance.   Those abiding sattva rise upwards, rajas stay midway, tamas sink downwards.   seer perceives no agent gunas, knows Him gunas, attains My being. As soon man realizes not doer, gunas agent, self' vanishes, goes actions spontaneously, sustain body. And body meant subserve highest end, actions even reveal detachment dispassion. Such seer easily glimpse One gunas offer devotion Him.   When embodied one transcends three gunas born contact body, released pain birth, death age attains deathlessness. Arjuna Said:   What, O Lord, marks transcended three gunas? How conduct himself? How transcend three gunas? The Lord Said:   He, O Pandava, not disdain light, activity, delusion come being, desires vanish;   He, seated one indifferent, not shaken gunas, stays still moves not, knowing gunas playing parts;   He holds pleasure pain alike, sedate, regards earth, stone gold, wise weighs equal scale things pleasant unpleasant, even-minded praise blame;   Who holds alike respect disrespect, friend foe, indulges no undertakingsThat man called gunatita. Shls.   -   must read considered together. Light activity delusion, seen foregoing shlokas, products indications sattva, rajas tamas respectively. The inner meaning verses transcended gunas unaffected them. A stone not desire light, disdain activity inertness; still, without so. If someone puts motion, not fret; again, allowed lie still, not feel inertness delusion seized it. The difference stone gunatita latter full consciousness full knowledge shakes free bonds bind ordinary mortal. He has, result knowledge, achieved purpose stone. Like stone witness, not doer, activities gunas prakriti. Of jnani one may say sitting still, unshaken knowledge gunas playing parts. We every moment lives acting though doers imagine state, hardly experience it. But hitch waggon star work way closer closer towards gradually withdrawing self actions. A gunatita experience condition cannot describe it, describe ceases one. The moment proceeds so, self' peeps in. The peace light bustle inertness common experience illusory. The Gita made clear many words sattvika state one nearest gunatita. Therefore every one strive develop sattva himself, believing day reach goal state gunatita.   He serves unwavering exclusive bhaktiyoga transcends gunas worthy become one Brahman.   For I image Brahman, changeless deathless, also everlasting dharma perfect bliss. Chapter_fifteen  With root branches below, ashvattha tree, say, impossible; Vedic hymns leaves; knows knows Vedas. Shvah means tomorrow, ashvattha (na shvopi sthata) means not last even tomorrow, i.e. world sense every moment state flux. But even though perpetually changing, root Brahman Supreme, imperishable. It protection support leaves Vedic hymns, i.e. dharma. He knows world sense knows dharma real jnani, man really known Vedas.  Above branches spread, blossoming gunas, shoots sense-objects; deep world men ramified roots, shape consequences action. This description tree world sense unenlightened see it. They fail discover Root Brahman always attached objects sense. They water tree three gunas remain bound Karman world men.  Its form not perceived, neither end, beginning, basis. Let man first hew deep-rooted Ashvattha sure weapon detachment;  Let pray win no return seek find refuge primal Being emanated ancient world action. Detachment shl.   means dispassion, aversion objects senses. Unless man determined cut temptations world sense go deeper mire every day. These verses show one dare not play objects senses impunity.  To imperishable enlightened souls gowho without pride delusion, triumphed taints attachment, ever tune Supreme, whose passions died, exempt pairs opposites, pleasure pain.  Neither sun, moon, fire illumine it; men arrive return notthat My supreme abode.  As part indeed Myself eternal Jiva world life, attracts mind five senses place prakriti.  When master (of body) acquires body discards carries wherever goes, even wind carries scents flower beds.  Having settled sensesear, eye, touch, taste, smellas well mind, frequents objects. These objects natural objects senses. The frequenting enjoyment would tainted sense I' it; otherwise pure, even child's enjoyment objects innocent.   The deluded perceive Him not He leaves settles (a body) enjoys (sense objects) association gunas; endowed eye knowledge alone see Him.   Yogins strive see Him seated themselves; witless ones not cleansed see Him not, even though strive.   The light sun illumines whole universe moon firethat light, know thou, Mine;   It I, penetrating earth uphold beings My strength, becoming moonthe essence sapnourish herbs;   It I becoming Vaishvanara Fire entering bodies breathe, assimilate four kinds food help outward inward breaths.   And I seated hearts all, Me proceed memory, knowledge dispelling doubts; I known Vedas, I, author Vedanta knower Vedas.   There two Beings world: kshara (perishable) akshara (imperishable). Kshara embraces creatures permanent basis akshara.   The Supreme Being surely anothercalled Paramatman Imperishable Ishvara pervades supports three worlds.   Because I transcend kshara also higher akshara, I known world Vedas Purushottama (the Highest Being).   He who, undeluded, knows Me Purushottama, knows all, worships Me heart, O Bharata.   Thus I revealed thee, sinless one, mysterious shastra; understands this, O Bharata, man understanding, fulfilled life's mission. Chapter_sixteen  Fearlessness, purity heart, steadfastness jnana yogaknowledge action, beneficence, self-restraint, sacrifice, spiritual study, austerity, uprightness;  Non-violence, truth, slowness wrath, spirit dedication, serenity, aversion slander, tenderness lives, freedom greed, gentleness, modesty, freedom levity;  Spiritedness, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom ill-will arrogancethese found one born divine heritage, O Bharata.  Pretentiousness, arrogance, self-conceit, wrath, coarseness, ignorancethese found one born devilish heritage.  The divine heritage makes Freedom, devilish bondage. Grieve not, O Partha; thou art born divine heritage.  There two orders created beings worldthe divine devilish; divine order described detail, hear Me devilish, O Partha.  Men devil not know may may not do; neither purity, right conduct, truth found them.  Without truth, without basis, without God universe,' say; born union sexes, prompted naught lust.'  Holding view, depraved souls, feeble understanding fierce deeds, come forth enemies world destroy it.   Given insatiable lust, possessed pretentiousness, arrogance conceit, seize wicked purposes delusion, go pledged uncleaned deeds.   Given boundless cares end death, making indulgence lust sole goal, convinced all;   Caught myriad snares hope, slaves lust wrath, speak unlawfully amass wealth satisfaction appetites.   This I gained today; aspiration I attain; wealth mine; likewise mine hereafter;   This enemy I already slain, others also I slay; lord I; enjoyment mine, perfection mine, strength mine, happiness mine;   Wealthy I, high-born. What like unto me? I perform sacrifice! I give alms! I merry!' Thus think they, ignorance deluded;   And tossed diverse fancies, caught net delusion, stuck deep indulgence appetites, foul hell fall.   Wise conceit, stubborn, full intoxication pelf pride, offer nominal sacrifices show, contrary rule.   Given pride, force, arrogance, lust wrath deriders indeed, scorning Me other' bodies.   These cruel scorners, lowest mankind vile, I hurl again, devilish wombs.   Doomed devilish wombs, deluded ones, far ever coming Me, sink lower lower birth birth.   Three-fold gate hell, leading man perditionLust, Wrath, Greed; three, therefore, shunned.   The man escapes three gates Darkness, O Kaunteya, works welfare thence reaches highest state.   He forsakes rule shastra bidding selfish desires, gains neither perfection, happiness, highest state. Shastra not mean rites formulae laid so-called dharmashastra, path self-restraint laid seers saints.   Therefore let shastra thy authority determining ought done ought not done; ascertain thou rule shastra thy task (accordingly). Shastra meaning preceding shloka. Let no one law unto himself, take authority law laid men known lived religion. Chapter_seventeen  What, then, O Krishna, position forsake rule Shastra yet worship faith? Do act sattva rajas tamas? The Lord Said:  Threefold faith men, expression nature case; sattvika, rajas tamasa. Hear thou it.  The faith every man accord innate character; man made faith; whatever object faith, even he.  Sattvika persons worship gods; rajas ones, Yakshas Rakshasas; othersmen tamasworship manes spirits.  Those men who, wedded pretentiousness arrogance, possessed violence lust passion, practice fierce austerity not ordained shastra;  They, whilst torture several elements make bodies, torture Me dwelling them; know unholy resolves.  Of three kinds food dear each; also sacrifice, austerity, charity. Hear differ.  Victuals add one's years, vitality, strength, health, happiness appetite; savoury, rich, substantial inviting, dear sattvika.  Victuals bitter, sour, salty, over-hot, spicy, dry, burning, causing pain, bitterness disease, dear rajasa.   Food become cold, insipid, putrid, stale, discarded unfit sacrifice, dear tamasa.   That sacrifice sattvika willingly offered duty without desire fruit according rule.   But sacrifice offered eye fruit vain glory, know, O Bharatashreshtha, rajasa.   Sacrifice contrary rule, produces no food, lacks sacred text, involves no giving up, devoid faith said tamasa.   Homage gods, Brahmanas, gurus wise men; cleanliness, uprightness, brahmacharya non-violencethese constitute austerity (tapas) body.   Words cause no hurt, true loving helpful, spiritual study constitute austerity speech.   Serenity, benignity, silence, self-restraint, purity spiritthese constitute austerity mind.   This threefold austerity practiced perfect faith men not desirous fruit, disciplined, said sattvika.   Austerity practiced eye gain praise, honour homage ostentation said rajasa; fleeting unstable.   Austerity practiced foolish obsession, either torture oneself procure another's ruin, called tamasa.   Charity, given matter duty, without expectation return, right place time, right person said sattvika.   Charity, given either hope receiving return, view winning merit, grudgingly, declared rajasa.   Charity given wrong place time, undeserving recipient disrespectfully contempt declared tamasa.   AUM TAT SAT declared threefold name Brahman name created old Brahmanas, Vedas sacrifices.   Therefore, AUM ever lips, rites sacrifice, charity austerity, performed always rule, Brahmavadins.   With utterance TAT without desire fruit several rites sacrifice, austerity charity performed seeking Freedom.   SAT employed sense real' good'; O Partha, SAT also applied beautiful deeds.   Constancy sacrifice, austerity charity, called SAT; work purposes also SAT. The substance last four shlokas every action done spirit complete dedication God. For AUM alone Reality. That dedicated It counts.   Whatever done, O Partha, way sacrifice, charity austerity work, called Asat done without faith. It counts naught hereafter here. Chapter_eighteen  Mahabahu! I would fain learn severally secret sannyasa tyaga, O Hrishikesha, O Keshinishudana. The Lord Said:  Renunciation actions springing selfish desire known sannyasa seers; abandonment fruit action called tyaga wise.  Some thoughtful persons say: All action abandoned evil'; others say: Action sacrifice, charity austerity not relinquished'.  Hear decision matter tyaga, O Bharatasattama; tyaga, too, O mightiest men, described three kinds.  Action sacrifice, charity austerity may not abandoned; must needs performed. Sacrifice, charity austerity purifiers wise.  But even actions performed abandoning attachment fruit; such, O Partha, best considered opinion.  It not right renounce one's allotted task; abandonment, delusion, said tamasa.  He abandons action, deeming painful fear straining limbs, never gain fruit abandonment, abandonment rajasa.  But allotted task performed sense duty abandonment attachment fruit, O Arjuna, abandonment deemed sattvika.   Neither disdain unpleasant action, cling pleasant actionthis wise man full sattva, practices abandonment, shaken doubts.   For embodied one cannot completely abandon action; abandons fruit action named tyagi.   To not practice abandonment accrues, pass away, fruit action three kinds: disagreeable, agreeable, mixed; never sannyasins.   Learn, me, O Mahabahu, five factors mentioned Sankhyan doctrine accomplishment action:   The field, doer, various means, several different operations, fifth last, Unseen.   Whatever action, right wrong, man undertakes body, speech mind, five factors thereof.   This so, who, reason unenlightened intellect, sees unconditioned Atman agentsuch man dense unseeing.   He free sense I', whose motive untainted, slays not bound, even though slay worlds. This shloka though seemingly somewhat baffling not really so. The Gita many occasions presents ideal attain aspirant strive may not possible completely realize world. It like definitions geometry. A perfect straight line not exist, necessary imagine order prove various propositions. Even so, necessary hold ideals nature standards imitation matters conduct. This would seem meaning shloka: He made ashes self', whose motive untainted, may slay whole world, will. But reality annihilated self' annihilated flesh too, whose motive untainted sees past, present future. Such one oneGod. He acts yet no doer, slays yet no slayer. For mortal man royal roadthe conduct worthyis ever him, viz. ahimsaholding life sacred.   Knowledge, object knowledge, knower compose threefold urge action; means, action doer compose threefold sum action.   Knowledge, action, doer three kinds according different gunas; hear thou these, described science gunas.   Know knowledge whereby one sees beings immutable entitya unity diversityto sattvika.   That knowledge perceives separately beings several entities diverse kinds, know thou rajasa.   And knowledge which, without reason, clings one single thing, though everything, misses true essence superficial tamasa.   That action called sattvika which, one's allotted task, performed without attachment, without like dislike, without desire fruit.   That action prompted desire fruit, thought I', involves much dissipation energy called rajasa.   That action blindly undertaken without regard capacity consequences, involving loss hurt, called tamasa.   That doer called sattvika shed attachment, thought I', filled firmness zeal, recks neither success failure.   That doer said rajasa passionate, desirous fruit action, greedy, violent, unclean, moved joy sorrow.   That doer called tamasa undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, knavish, spiteful, indolent, woebegone, dilatory.   Hear now, O Dhananjaya, detailed fully severally, threefold division understanding will, according gunas.   That understanding, O Partha, sattvika knows action inaction, ought done ought not done, fear fearlessness bondage release.   That understanding, O Partha, rajasa, decides erroneously right wrong, ought done ought not done.   That understanding, O Partha, tamasa, which, shrouded darkness, thinks wrong right mistakes everything reverse.   That will, O Partha, sattvika maintains unbroken harmony activities mind, vital energies senses.   That will, O Partha, rajasa clings, attachment, righteousness, desire wealth, desirous fruit case.   That will, O Partha, tamasa, whereby insensate man not abandon sleep, fear, grief, despair self-conceit.   Hear Me, O Bharatarshabha, three kinds pleasure. Pleasure enjoyed repeated practice, puts end pain,   Which, inception, poison, end nectar, born serene realization true nature Atmanthat pleasure said sattvika.   That pleasure called rajasa which, arising contact senses objects, first nectar end like poison.   That pleasure called tamasa arising sleep sloth heedlessness, stupefies soul first end.   There no being, either earth heaven among gods, free three gunas born prakriti.   The duties Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, distributed according innate qualifications, O Parantapa.   Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness, uprightness, knowledge discriminative knowledge, faith God Brahmana's natural duties.   Valour, spiritedness, constancy, resourcefulness, not fleeing battle, generosity, capacity rule natural duties Kshatriya.   Tilling soil, protection cow commerce natural functions Vaishya, service natural duty Shudra.   Each man, complete absorption performance duty, wins perfection. Hear wins perfection devotion duty.   By offering worship duty Him moving spirit beings, pervaded, man wins perfection.   Better one's duty, though uninviting, another's may easily performed; duty accords one's nature, one incurs no sin. The central teaching Gita detachmentabandonment fruit action. And would no room abandonment one prefer another's duty one's own. Therefore one's duty said better another's. It spirit duty done matters, unattached performance reward.   One not abandon, O Kaunteya, duty one born, imperfect though be; action, inception, enveloped imperfection, fire smoke.   He weaned kinds, master himself, dead desire, attains renunciation perfection freedom action.   Learn Me, brief, O Kaunteya, gained perfection, attains Brahman, supreme consummation knowledge.   Equipped purified understanding, restraining self firm will, abandoning sound objects senses, putting aside likes dislikes,   Living solitude, spare diet, restrained speech, body mind, ever absorbed dhyanayoga, anchored dispassion,   Without pride, violence, arrogance, lust, wrath, possession, shed sense mine' peace himself, fit become one Brahman.   One Brahman peace himself, grieves not, desires; holding beings alike, achieves supreme devotion Me.   By devotion, realizes truth great I am, I am; known Me reality enters Me.   Even whilst always performing actions, makes Me refuge wins, My grace, eternal imperishable haven.   Casting, thy mind, actions Me, make Me thy goal, resorting yoga even-mindedness fix thy thought ever Me.   Fixing thy thought Me, thou shalt surmount obstacles My grace; possessed sense I' thou listen not, thou shalt perish.   If obsessed sense I', thou thinkest, I not fight', vain thy obsession; (thy) nature compel thee.   What thou wilt not do, O Kaunteya, thy delusion, thou shalt do, even thy will, bound thou art duty thou art born.   God, O Arjuna, dwells heart every His delusive mystery whirls all, (as though) set machine.   In Him alone seek thy refuge thy heart, O Bharata. By His grace shalt thou win eternal supreme peace.   Thus I expounded thee mysterious knowledge; ponder fully, act thou wilt.   Hear My supreme word, mysterious all; dearly beloved thou art Me, hence I desire declare thy welfare.   On Me fix thy mind, Me bring thy devotion, Me offer thy sacrifice, Me make thy obeisance; Me indeed shalt thou comesolemn My promise thee, thou art dear Me.   Abandon duties come Me refuge. I release thee sins; grieve not!   Utter never knows no austerity, no devotion, desire listen, yet scoffs Me.   He propound supreme mystery My devotees, shall, act highest devotion Me, surely come Me.   Nor among men renders dearer service Me he; earth beloved Me he. It gained knowledge lived life declare others. These two shlokas cannot possibly reference him, no matter conducts himself, give flawless reading interpretation Gita.   And man faith who, scorning not, listen it,even released go happy worlds men virtuous deeds.   Hast thou heard this, O Partha, concentrated mind? Has thy delusion, born ignorance, destroyed, O Dhananjaya? Arjuna Said:   Thanks Thy grace, O Achyuta, delusion destroyed, understanding returned. I stand secure, doubts dispelled; I thy bidding. Sanjaya Said:   Thus I hear marvellous thrilling discourse Vasudeva great-souled Partha.   It Vyasa's favor I listened supreme mysterious Yoga expounded lips Master Yoga, Krishna Himself.   O King, often I recall marvellous purifying discourse Keshava Arjuna, I filled recurring rapture.   And often I recall marvellous form Hari, wonder knows no bounds I rejoice again.   Wheresoever Krishna, Master Yoga, is, wheresoever Partha Bowman, rest assured Fortune, Victory, Prosperity, Eternal Right. \n",
            "Chapter_one  Tell me, O Sanjaya, sons Pandu's assembled, battle intent, field Kuru, field duty. The human body battlefield eternal duel right wrong goes on. Therefore capable turned gateway Freedom. It born sin becomes seed-bed sin. Hence also called field Kuru. The Kuravas represent forces Evil, Pandavas forces Good. Who not experienced daily conflict within forces Evil forces Good? Sanjaya Said:  On seeing Pandava's army drawn battle array, King Duryodhana approached Drona, preceptor, addressed thus:  Behold, O preceptor, mighty army sons Pandu, set array son Drupada, thy wise disciple.  Here brave bowmen, peers Bhima Arjuna fighting: Yuyudhana Virata, Maharatha' Drupada.  Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, valorous Kashiraja, Purujit Kuntibhoja, Shaibya, chief among men;  Valiant Yudhamanyu, valorous Uttamaujas, Subhadra's son, sons Draupadi--each one 'Maharatha'.  Acquaint thyself now, O best Brahmanas, distinguished among us. I mention thy information, names captains army.  Thy noble self, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, victorious battle, Ashvatthaman, Vikarna, also Somadatta's son;  There many another hero, known skill wielding diverse weapons, pledged lay life sake, adepts war.   This force, commanded Bhishma, inadequate; theirs, commanded Bhima, quite adequate.   Therefore, let you, holding appointed places, every entrance, guard Bhishma.   At this, heroic grandsire, grand old man Kurus, gave loud lion's roar blew conch hearten Duryodhana.   Thereupon, conches, drums, cymbals trumpets sounded once. Terrific noise.   Then Madhava Pandava, standing great chariot yoked white steeds, blew divine conches.   Hrishikesha blew Panchajanya Dhananjaya Devadatta; wolf-bellied Bhima dread deeds sounded great conch Paundra.   King Yudhishthira, Kunti's son, blew Anantavijaya, Nakula nd Sahadeva conches, Sughosha Manipushpaka.   And Kashiraja, great bowman, Shikhandi Dhrishtadyumna, Virata Satyaki, unconquerable; 'Maharatha',   Drupada, Draupadi's sons, strong-armed son Subhadra, these, O King, blew conch.   That terrifying tumult, causing earth heaven resound, rent hearts Dhritarashtra's sons.   -  Then, O King, ape-bannered Pandava, seeing Dhritarashtra's sons arrayed flight arrows begin, took bow, spoke Hrishikesha: \"Set chariot two armies, O Achyuta!\"   That I may behold drawn up, battle intent, know I engage fearful combat;   And I may survey fighters assembled anxious fulfil battle perverse Duryodhana's desire. Sanjaya Said:   -  Thus addressed Gudakesha, O King, Hrishikesha set unique chariot two armies front Bhishma, Drona kings said: Behold, O Partha, Kurus assembled yonder.   -  Then Partha see, standing there, sires, grandsires, preceptors, uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law friends armies. Beholding kinsmen ranged him, Kaunteya overcome great compassion spake anguish: Arjuna Said:   -  As I look upon kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled eager fight, limbs fail, mouth parched, tremor shakes frame hair stands end.   Gandiva slips hand, skin fire, I cannot keep feet, mind reels.   I unhappy forebodings, O Keshava; I see no good slaying kinsmen battle.   I seek not victory, sovereign power, earthly joys. What good sovereign power, worldly pleasures even life us, O Govinda?   Those would desire sovereign power, earthly joys delights arrayed battle, renounced life wealth-  Preceptors, sires, grandsires, sons even fathers-in-law, brothers-in-law, kinsmen. grandsons, uncles,   These I would not kill, O Madhusudana, even though slay me, not even kingship three worlds, much less earthly kingdom.   What pleasure slaying sons Dhritarashtra, O Janardana? Sin lot, slay these, usurpers though be.   It not therefore behove us kill kinsmen, sons Dhritarashtra. How may happy, O Madhava, killing kins?   Even though these, wits warped greed, see not guilt lies destroying family, sin treachery comrades;   How we, O Janardana, help recoiling sin, seeing clearly guilt lies destruction?   With destruction family perish eternal family virtues, perishing virtues unrighteousness seizes whole family.   When unrighteousness prevails, O Krishna, women family become corrupt, corruption, O Varshneya, causes confusion varnas.   This confusion verily drags family-slayer, well family, hell, want obsequial offerings rites departed sires fall blessedness.   By sins family-slayers resulting confusion varnas, eternal tribal family virtues brought naught.   For handed us, O Janardana, men whose family virtues ruined doomed dwell hell.   Alas! What heinous sin commit, that, greed joy sovereign power, prepared slay kith kin!   Happier far would Dhritarashtra's sons, weapons hand, strike battlefield, unresisting unarmed. Sanjaya Said:   Thus spake Arjuna field battle, dropping bow arrows sank seat chariot, overwhelmed anguish. Chapter_two  To Arjuna, overcome compassion, sorrowing, eyes obscured flowing tears, Madhusudana spake words: The Lord Said:  How perilous moment delusion, unworthy noble, leading neither heaven glory, overtaken thee?  Yield not unmanliness, O Partha; not become thee. Shake miserable faint-heartedness arise, O Parantapa! Arjuna Said:  How I, arrows, engage Bhishma Drona battle, O Madhusudana, worthy reverence, O Arisudana?  It better far live alms world slay venerable elders. Having slain I blood-stained enjoyments.  Nor know better us, conquer conquer us, stand us Dhritarashtra's sons killed no desire live.  My paralysed faint-heartedness; mind discerns not duty; hence I ask thee; tell me, I pray thee, no uncertain language, wherein lies good. I thy disciple; guide me; I see refuge thee.  For I see nothing dispel anguish shrivels senses even I win earth uncontested sovereignty thriving kingdom lordship gods. Sanjaya Said:  Thus spoke Gudakesha Parantapa Hrishikesha Govinda, words 'I not fight' became speechless.   To stricken anguish, O Bharata! two armies, Hrishikesha, though mocking, addressed words: The Lord Said:   Thou mournest thou shouldst not mourn utterest vain words wisdom. The wise mourn neither living dead.   For never I not, thou, kings; us cease hereafter.   As embodied one has, present body, infancy, youth age, even receive another body. The wise man not deceived therein.   O Kaunteya! Contacts senses objects bring cold heat, pleasure pain; come go transient. Endure them, O Bharata.   O noblest men, wise man not disturbed these, unmoved pleasure pain, fitted immortality.   What non-Being never known been, Being never known not been. Of secret seen seers Truth.   Know imperishable whereby pervaded. No one destroy immutable being.   These bodies embodied one eternal, imperishable immeasurable finite. Fight, therefore, O Bharata.   He thinks This (Atman) slayer believes This slain, ignorant. This neither slays ever slain.   This never born ever dies, ever not more; unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient, This not slain body slain.   He knows This, O Partha, imperishable, eternal, unborn, immutablewhom man slay cause slain?   As man casts worn-out garments takes others new, even embodied one casts worn-out bodies passes others new.   This no weapons wound, This no fire burns, This no waters wet, This no wind doth dry.   Beyond cutting, burning, wetting drying This-eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, everlasting.   Perceivable neither senses mind, This called unchangeable; therefore knowing This thou shouldst not grieve.   And thou deemest This always coming birth always dying, even then, O Mahabahu, thou shouldst not grieve.   For certain death born, certain birth dead; therefore unavoidable thou shouldst not regret.   The state beings birth unmanifest; middle state manifest; state death unmanifest. What occasion lament, O Bharata?   One looks upon This marvel; another speaks This such; another hears thereof marvel; yet heard This none truly knows This.   This embodied one body every ever beyond harm, O Bharata; thou shouldst not, therefore, grieve one. Thus far Lord Krishna, force argument based pure reason, demonstrated Atman abiding physical body fleeting, explained if, certain circumstances, destruction physical body deemed justifiable, delusion imagine Kauravas not slain kinsmen. Now reminds Arjuna duty Kshatriya.   Again, seeing thine duty thou shouldst not shrink it; no higher good Kshatriya righteous war.   Such fight, coming unsought, gateway heaven thrown open, falls lot happy Kshatriyas, O Partha.   But thou wilt not fight righteous fight, failing thy duty losing thine honour thou wilt incur sin.   The world ever recount story thy disgrace; man honour disgrace worse death.   The Maharathas think fear made thee retire battle; thou wilt fall esteem ones held thee high.   Thine enemies deride thy prowess speak many unspeakable words thee. What painful that?   Slain, thou shalt gain heaven; victorious, thou inherit earth: therefore arise, O Kaunteya, determined fight. Having declared highest truth, viz. immortality eternal Atman fleeting nature physical body (  -  ), Krishna reminds Arjuna Kshatriya may not flinch fight comes unsought (  -  ). He (  -  ) shows highest truth performance duty incidentally coincide expediency. Next proceeds foreshadow central teaching Gita following shloka.   Hold alike pleasure pain, gain loss, victory defeat, gird thy loins fight; thou shalt not incur sin.   Thus I set thee attitude Knowledge; hear attitude Action; resorting attitude thou shalt cast bondage action.   Here no effort undertaken lost, no disaster befalls. Even little righteous course delivers one great fear.   The attitude, matter, springing, does, fixed resolve one, O Kurunandana; no fixed resolve attitudes many-branched unending. When attitude ceases one undivided becomes many divided, ceases one settled will, broken various wills desires man tossed about.   -  The ignorant, revelling letter Vedas, declare naught else; carnally-minded, holding heaven goal, utter swelling words promise birth fruit action dwell many varied rites performed sake pleasure power; intent, are, pleasure power swelling words rob wits, no settled attitude centered supreme goal. The Vedic ritual, opposed doctrine Yoga laid Gita, alluded here. The Vedic ritual lays countless ceremonies rites view attaining merit heaven. These, divorced essence Vedas short-lived result, worthless.   The Vedas domain three gunas; eschew them, O Arjuna. Free thyself pairs opposites, abide eternal truth, scorn gain guard anything, remain master thy soul.   To extent well use flood water sides, extent Vedas use enlightened Brahmana.   Action alone thy province, never fruits thereof; let not thy motive fruit action, shouldst thou desire avoid action.   Act thou, O Dhananjaya, without attachment, steadfast Yoga, even-minded success failure. Even-mindedness Yoga.   For action, O Dhananjaya, far inferior unattached action; seek refuge attitude detached action. Pitiable make fruit motive.   Here world man gifted attitude detachment escapes fruit good evil deeds. Gird thyself Yoga, therefore. Yoga skill action.   For sages, gifted attitude detachment, renounce fruit action, released bondage birth attain state free ills.   When thy understanding passed slough delusion, wilt thou indifferent alike thou hast heard wilt hear.   When thy understanding, distracted much hearing, rest steadfast unmoved concentration, wilt thou attain Yoga. Arjuna Said:   What, O Keshava, mark man whose understanding secure, whose mind fixed concentration? How talk? How sit? How move. The Lord Said:   When man puts away, O partha, cravings arise mind finds comfort Atman, called man secure understanding. To find comfort oneself Atman means look spirit within spiritual comfort, not outside objects nature must give pleasure well pain. Spiritual comfort bliss must distinguished pleasure happiness. The pleasure I may derive possession wealth, instance, delusive; real spiritual comfort bliss attained I rise superior every temptation even though troubled pangs poverty hunger.   Whose mind untroubled sorrows longeth not joys, free passion, fear wrathhe called ascetic secure understanding.   Who owns attachment nowhere, feels neither joy resentment whether good bad comes waythat man's understanding secure.   And when, like tortoise drawing limbs every side, man draws senses objects, understanding secure.   When man starves senses, objects senses disappear him, not yearning them; yearning departs beholds Supreme. The shloka not rule fasting forms self-restraint, indicates limitations, restraints needed subduing desire sense-objects, however rooted one vision Supreme. The higher yearning conquers lower yearnings.   For, spite wise man's endeavour, O Kaunteya, unruly senses distract mind perforce.   Holding check, yogi sit intent Me; whose senses control secure understanding. This means without devotion consequent grace God, man's endeavour vain.   In man brooding objects senses, attachment springs up; attachment begets craving craving begets wrath. Craving cannot lead resentment, unending unsatisfied.   Wrath breeds stupefaction, stupefaction leads loss memory, loss memory ruins reason, ruin reason spells utter destruction.   But disciplined soul, moving among sense-objects senses weaned likes dislikes brought control Atman, attains peace mind.   Peace mind means end ills, understanding whose mind peace stands secure.   The undisciplined man neither understanding devotion; no devotion no peace, no peace whence happiness?   For mind runs roaming senses, sweeps away understanding, wind vessel upon waters.   Therefore, O Mahabahu, he, whose senses reined sides objects, man secure understanding.   When night beings, disciplined soul awake; beings awake, night seeing ascetic. This verse indicates divergent paths discipline ascetic sensual man. Whereas ascetic dead things world lives God, sensual man alive things world dead things spirit.   He longings subside, even waters subside ocean which, though ever filled them, never overflowsthat man finds peace; not cherishes longing.   The man sheds longing moves without concern, free sense I' Mine'he attains peace.   This state, O partha, man rests Brahman; attained it, not deluded. He abides state even hour death passes oneness Brahman. Chapter_three  If, O Janardana, thou holdest attitude detachment superior action, why, O Keshava, dost thou urge dreadful action?  Thou dost seem confuse understanding perplexing speech; tell me, therefore, no uncertain voice, alone whereby I may attain salvation. Arjuna sore perplexed, whilst one hand rebuked faint-heartedness, seems advised refrain action (II.  -  ). But this, reality, not case following shlokas show. The Lord Said:  I spoken, before, O sinless one, two attitudes worldthe Sankhayas', Jnana yoga Yogins', karma yoga.  Never man enjoy freedom action not undertaking action, attain freedom mere renunciation action. Freedom action' freedom bondage action. This freedom not gained cessation activity, apart fact cessation nature things impossible (see following shloka). How may gained? The following shlokas explain.  For none ever remains inactive even moment; compelled action gunas inherent prakriti.  He curbs organs action allows mind dwell sense-objects,such one, wholly deluded, called hypocrite. The man curbs tongue mentally swears another hypocrite. But not mean free rein given organs action long mind cannot brought control. Self-imposed physical restraint condition precedent mental restraint. Physical restraint entirely self-imposed not super-imposed outside, e.g. fear. The hypocrite held contempt not humble aspirant self-restraint. The shloka reference man curbs body cannot help indulging mind, would indulge body possibly could. The next shloka puts thing conversely.  But he, O Arjuna, keeping senses control mind, engages organs Karma yoga, without attachmentthat man excels. The mind body made accord well. Even mind kept control, body active one way another. But whose mind truly restrained will, instance, close ears foul talk open listen praise God good men. He no relish sensual pleasures keep occupied activity ennobles soul. That path action. Karma yoga yoga (means) deliver self bondage body, no room self-indulgence.  Do thou thy allotted task; action superior inaction; inaction even life's normal course not possible.  This world men suffers bondage action save done sake sacrifice; end, O Kaunteya, perform action without attachment. Action sake sacrifice' means acts selfless service dedicated God.   Together sacrifice Lord beings create, old, mankind, declaring: \"By ye increase; may giver desires.   \"With may cherish gods may gods cherish you; cherishing one another may attain highest good.   \"Cherished sacrifice, gods bestow desired boons.\" He enjoys gifts without rendering aught unto verily thief. \"Gods\" shlokas       must taken mean whole creation God. The service created beings service gods sacrifice.   The righteous men eat residue sacrifice freed sin, wicked cook eat sin.   From food springs life, rain born food; sacrifice comes rain sacrifice result action.   Know action springs Brahman Brahman Imperishable; hence all-pervading Brahman ever firm-founded sacrifice.   He not follow wheel set motion below, he, living sin, sating senses, lives, O Partha, vain.   But man revels Atman, content Atman satisfied Atman, no action exists.   He no interest whatever anything done, anything not done, need rely anything personal ends.   Therefore, thou ever perform without attachment work thou must do; performing action without attachment man attains Supreme.   For action alone Janaka others achieved perfection; even view guidance mankind thou must act.   Whatever best man does, also done men, example sets, world follows.   For me, O Partha, naught three worlds, nothing worth gaining I not gained; yet I ever action. An objection sometimes raised God impersonal not likely perform physical activity, best He may supposed act mentally. This not correct. For unceasing movement sun, moon, earth etc. signifies God action. This not mental physical activity. Though God without form impersonal, He acts though He form body. Hence though He ever action, He free action, unaffected action. What must borne mind that, Nature's movements processes mechanical yet guided Divine Intelligence Will, even man must reduce daily conduct mechanical regularity precision, must intelligently. Man's merit lies observing divine guidance back processes intelligent imitation rather emphasizing mechanical nature thereof reducing automation. One withdraw self, withdraw attachment fruit action, not mechanical precision security wear tear ensured. Acting man remains fresh end days. His body perish due course, soul remain evergreen without crease wrinkle.   Indeed, I not, unslumbering, ever remain action, O Partha, men would follow example every way.   If I not perform task, worlds would ruined; I cause chaos end mankind.   Just as, attachment, unenlightened perform actions, O Bharata, even so, unattached, enlightened man act, desire welfare humanity.   The enlightened may not confuse mind unenlightened, attached action; rather must perform actions unattached, encourage likewise.   All action entirely done gunas prakriti. Man, deluded sense I', thinks, I doer'.   But he, O Mahabahu, understands truth various gunas various activities, knows gunas operate gunas; not claim doer. As breathing, winking similar processes automatic man claims no agency them, conscious processes disease similar cause arrests them, similar manner acclivities automatic, without arrogating agency responsibility thereof. A man charity not even know charitable acts, nature so, cannot help it. This detachment come tireless endeavour God's grace.   Deluded gunas prakriti men become attached activities gunas; knows truth things not unhinge slow-witted not knowledge.   Cast thy acts Me, thy mind fixed indwelling Atman, without thought fruit, sense mine' shake thy fever fight! He knows Atman inhabiting body realizes Him part supreme Atman dedicate everything Him, even faithful servant acts mere shadow master dedicates does. For master real doer, servant instrument.   Those always act according rule I laid down, faith without cavillingthey released bondage actions.   But cavil rule refuse conform fools, dead knowledge; know lost.   Even man knowledge acts according nature; creatures follow nature; constraint avail? Man's energies bent towards achieving complete self-restraint end days. But not succeed, neither constraint help him. The shloka not rule restraint explains nature prevails. He justifies saying, I cannot this, not nature,' misreads shloka. True not know nature, habit not nature. Progress, not decline, ascent, not descent, nature soul, therefore every threatened decline descent ought resisted.   Each sense settled likes dislikes towards objects; man not come sway these, besetters. Hearing, instance, object ears may inclined hear something disinclined hear something else. Man may not allow swayed likes dislikes, must decide conducive growth, ultimate end reach state beyond happiness misery.   Better one's duty, bereft merit, another's well-performed; better death discharge one's duty; another's duty fraught danger. One man's duty may serve community working sweeper, another's may work accountant. An accountant's work may inviting, need not draw sweeper away work. Should allow drawn away would lost put community danger. Before God work man judged spirit done, not nature work makes no difference whatsoever. Whoever acts spirit dedication fits salvation. Arjuna Said:   Then impels man sin, O Varshneya, even will, though force compelled? The Lord Said:   It Lust, Wrath, born gunaRajas. It arch-devourer, arch-sinner. Know man's enemy here.   As fire obscured smoke, mirror dirt, embryo amnion, knowledge obscured this.   Knowledge obscured, O Kaunteya, eternal enemy wise man, form Lust, insatiable fire.   The senses, mind reason said great seat; means obscures knowledge stupefies man. When Lust seizes senses, mind corrupted, discrimination obscured reason ruined. See II.   -    Therefore, O Bharatarshabha, bridle thou first senses rid thyself sinner, destroyer knowledge discrimination.   Subtle, say, senses; subtler senses mind; subtler mind reason; subtler even reason He.   Thus realizing Him subtler reason, controlling self Self (Atman), destroy, O Mahabahu, enemyLust, hard overcome. When man realizes Him, mind control, not swayed senses. And mind conquered, power Lust? It indeed subtle enemy, senses, mind reason control subtlemost Self, Lust extinguished. Chapter_four  I expounded imperishable yoga Vivasvat; Vivasvat communicated Manu, Manu Ikshvaku.  Thus handed succession, royal sages learnt it; long lapse time dwindled away world, O Parantapa.  The ancient yoga I expounded thee today; thou art My devotee My friend, supreme mystery. Arjuna Said:  Later Thy birth, Lord, earlier Vivasvat. How I understand Thou didst expound beginning? The Lord Said:  Many births passed through, O Arjuna, thou I; I know all, thou knowest not, O Parantapa. Though unborn inexhaustible My essence, though Lord beings, yet assuming control My Nature, I come My mysterious power.  For whenever Right declines Wrong prevails, O Bharata, I come birth.  To save righteous, destroy wicked, re-establish Right I born age age. Here comfort faithful affirmation truth Right ever prevails. An eternal conflict Right Wrong goes on. Sometimes latter seems get upper hand, Right ultimately prevails. The good never destroyed, Rightwhich Truthcannot perish; wicked destroyed, Wrong no independent existence. Knowing let man cease arrogate authorship eschew untruth, violence evil. Inscrutable Providencethe unique power Lordis ever work. This fact avatara, incarnation. Strictly speaking no birth God.  He knows secret My divine birth action not born again, leaving body; comes Me, O Arjuna. For man secure faith Right always prevails, never swerves therefrom, pursuing bitterest end serious odds, no part effort proceeds ego, dedicated Him, ever one Him, released birth death.   Freed passion, fear wrath, filled full Me, relying Me, refined fiery ordeal knowledge, many become one Me.   In whatever way men resort Me, even I render them. In every way, O Partha, path men follow Mine. That is, whole world His ordinance. No one may break God's law impunity. As sow, reap. This law operates inexorably without fear favor.   Those desire actions bear fruit worship gods here; world men fruit action quickly obtainable. Gods, indicated before, must not taken mean heavenly beings tradition, whatever reflects divine. In sense man also god. Steam, electricity great forces Nature gods. Propitiation forces quickly bears fruit, well know, short-lived. It fails bring comfort soul certainly not take one even short step towards salvation.   The order four varnas created Me according different gunas karma each; yet know though, therefore, author thereof, changeless I not author.   Actions not affect Me, I concerned fruits thereof. He recognizes Me not bound actions. For man supreme example one though action not doer thereof. And instruments His hands, room arrogating responsibility action?   Knowing men old, desirous freedom, perform action; thou, then, didthe men old days gone by.   What action? What inaction?'here even wise perplexed. I expound thee action knowing thou shalt saved evil.   For meet know meaning action, forbidden action, also inaction. Impenetrable secret action.   Who sees action action action inaction, enlightened among men, yogi, done need do. The action' who, though ever active, not claim doer, inaction; inaction' who, though outwardly avoiding action, always building castles mind, action. The enlightened man grasped secret action knows no action proceeds him, proceeds God hence selflessly remains absorbed action. He true yogi. The man acts self-fully misses secret action cannot distinguish Right Wrong. The soul's natural progress towards selflessness purity one might, therefore, say man strays path purity strays selflessness. All actions selfless man naturally pure.   He whose every undertaking free desire selfish purpose, burnt actions fire knowledgesuch one wise call pandita.   He renounced attachment fruit action, ever content, free dependence,he, though immersed action, yet acts not. That is, action not bind him.   Expecting naught, holding mind body check, putting away every possession, going action body incurs no stain. The purest act, tainted self', binds. But done spirit dedication, ceases bind. When self' completely subsided, body works. For instance, case man asleep body alone working. A prisoner prison tasks surrendered body prison authorities body, therefore, works. Similarly, voluntarily made God's prisoner, nothing himself. His body mechanically acts, doer God, hot he. He reduced nothingness.   Content whatever chance may bring, rid pairs opposites, free ill-will, even-minded success failure, not bound though acts.   Of free soul shred attachment, whose mind firmly grounded knowledge, acts sacrifice, karma extinguished.   The offering sacrifice Brahman; oblation Brahman; offered Brahman fire Brahman; whose mind fixed acts dedicated Brahman must needs pass Brahman.   Some yogins perform sacrifice form worship gods, others offer sacrifice sacrifice fire Brahman.   Some offer sacrifice sense hearing senses fires restraint; others sacrifice sound objects sense fires senses. The restraint senseshearing othersis one thing; directing legitimate objects, e.g. listening hymns praise god, another, although ultimately amount thing.   Others sacrifice activities senses vital energy yogic fire self-control kindled knowledge. That say, lose contemplation Supreme.   Some sacrifice material gifts; austerities; yoga; acquiring imparting knowledge. All sacrifices stern vows serious endeavour.   Others absorbed practices control vital energy sacrifice outward inward inward outward, check flow inward outward vital airs. The reference three kinds practices control vital energypuraka, rechaka, kumbhaka.   Yet others, abstemious food, sacrifice one form vital energy another. All know sacrifice purge impurities sacrifice.   Those partake residue sacrificecalled amrita (ambrosia)attain everlasting Brahman. Even world not non-sacrificer; next, O Kurusattama?   Even various sacrifices described Vedas; know proceed action; knowing thou shalt released. Action means mental, physical spiritual action. No sacrifice possible without triple action no salvation without sacrifice. To know put knowledge practice know secret sacrifice. In fine, unless man uses physical, mental spiritual gifts service mankind, thief unfit Freedom. He uses intellect spares body not full sacrificer. Unless mind body soul made work unison, cannot adequately used service mankind. Physical, mental spiritual purity essential harmonious working. Therefore man concentrate developing, purifying, turning best faculties.   Knowledge-sacrifice better, O-Parantapa, material sacrifice, action not bind finds consummation Knowledge (jnana). Who not know works charity performed without knowledge often result great harm? Unless every act, however nobel motive, informed knowledge, lacks perfection. Hence complete fulfillment action knowledge.   The masters knowledge seen Truth impart thee Knowledge; learn humble homage service repeated questioning. The three conditions knowledgehomage, repeated questioning servicedeserve carefully borne mind age. Homage obeisance means humility service necessary accompaniment; else would mock homage. Repeated questioning equally essential, without keen spirit inquiry, no knowledge. All presupposes devotion faith person approached. There no humility, much less service, without faith.   When thou hast gained knowledge, O Pandava, thou shalt not fall error; virtue thou shalt see beings without exception thyself Me. The adage Yatha pinde tatha brahmande'as self universe') means thing. He attained Self-realization sees no difference others.   Even though thou sinful sinners, thou shalt cross ocean sin boat knowledge.   As blazing fire turns fuel ashes, O Arjuna, even fire Knowledge turns actions ashes.   There nothing world purifying Knowledge. He perfected yoga finds fullness time.   It man faith gains knowledgethe man intent mastery senses; gained knowledge, comes ere long supreme peace.   But man doubt, without knowledge without faith, lost; given doubt neither world beyond, happiness.   He renounced action means yoga, severed doubt means knowledgehim self-possessed, no actions bind, O Dhananjaya!   Therefore, sword Self-realization sever thou doubt, bred ignorance, crept thy heart! Betake thyself yoga arise, O Bharata! Chapter_five  Thou laudest renunciation actions, O Krishna, whilst time thou laudest performance action; tell certainty better. The Lord Said:  Renunciation performance action lead salvation; two, karmayoga (performance) better sannyasa (renunciation).  Him one know ever renouncing no dislikes likes; free pairs opposites easily released bondage. That is, not renunciation action attachment pairs determines true renunciation. A man always action may good sannyasa (renouncer) another may no work may well hypocrite. See III.   It ignorant speak sankhya yoga different, not knowledge. He rightly established even one wins fruit both. The yogi engrossed sankhya (knowledge)lives even thought good world attains fruit karmayoga sheer power thought. The karmayogi ever engrossed unattached action naturally enjoys peace jnanayogi.  The goal sankhyas attain also reached yogins. He sees truly sees sankhya yoga one.  But renunciation, O Mahabahu, hard attain except yoga; ascetic equipped yoga attains Brahman ere long.  The yogi cleared himself, gained mastery mind senses, become one Atman creation, although acts remains unaffected.  The yogi seen Truth knows not acts whilst seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing,  Talking, letting go, holding fast, opening closing eyesin conviction senses moving respective spheres. So long self' endures, detachment cannot achieved. A sensual man therefore may not shelter pretence not senses acting. Such mischievous interpretation betrays gross ignorance Gita right conduct. The next shloka makes clear.   He dedicates actions Brahman performs without attachment not smeared sin, lotus-leaf water.   Only body, mind intellect also senses, yogins perform action without attachment sake self-purification.   A man yoga obtains everlasting peace abandoning fruit action; man ignorant yoga, selfishly attached fruit, remains bound.   Renouncing mind actions, dweller body, master himself, rests happily city nine gates, neither getting anything done. The principal gates body two eyes, two nostrils, two ears, mouth, two organs excretionthough really speaking countless pores skin no less gates. If gatekeeper always remains alert performs task, letting objects deserve ingress egress, truly said no part ingress egress, passive witness. He nothing gets thing done.   The Lord creates neither agency action world; neither connect action fruit. It nature work. God no doer. The inexorable law karma prevails, fulfillment lawgiving everyone deserts, making everyone reap sowslies God's abounding mercy justice. In undiluted justice mercy. Mercy inconsistent justice not mercy opposite. But man not judge knowing past, present, future. So law reversed mercy forgiveness purest justice. Being ever liable judged must accord others would accord himself, viz. forgiveness. Only cultivating spirit forgiveness reach state yogi, no actions bind, man even-mindedness, man skilled action.   The Lord not take upon Himself anyone's vice virtue; ignorance veils knowledge deludes creatures. The delusion lies man arrogating authorship action attributing God consequences thereofpunishment reward case may be.   But whose ignorance destroyed knowledge Atman, knowledge, like sun, reveals Supreme.   Those whose intellect suffused That, whose self become one That, abide That, whose end aim that, wipe sins knowledge, go whence no return.   The men Self-realization look equal eye brahmana possessed learning humility, cow, elephant, dog even dog-eater. That say, serve every one alike, according needs each. Treating brahmana shwapaka (dog-eater) alike means wise man suck poison snake-bitten shwapaka much eagerness readiness would snake-bitten brahmana.   In body conquered round birth death, whose mind anchored sameness; perfect Brahman all, therefore Brahman rest. As man thinks, becomes, therefore whose minds bent achieve sameness become one Brahman.   He whose understanding secure, undeluded, knows Brahman rests Brahman, neither glad get pleasant, sad get unpleasant.   He detached contacts without, finds bliss Atman; achieved union Brahman enjoys eternal bliss. He weaned outward objects inner Atman fitted union Brahman highest bliss. To withdraw oneself contacts without bask sunshine union Brahman two aspects state, two sides coin.   For joys derived sense-contacts nothing mines misery; beginning end, O Kaunteya; wise man not revel therein.   The man able even earth, ere released body, hold floodtide lust wrath,he yogi, happy. As corpse no likes dislikes, no sensibility pleasure pain, even though alive dead these, truly lives, truly happy.   He finds happiness within, rest within, light within,that yogi, become one nature, attains oneness Brahman.   They win oneness Brahmanthe seers whose sins wiped out, whose doubts resolved, mastered themselves, engrossed welfare beings.   Rid lust wrath, masters themselves, ascetics realized Atman find oneness Brahman everywhere around them.   -  That ascetic ever freewho, shut outward sense-contacts, sits gaze fixed brows, outward inward breathing nostrils made equal; senses, mind, reason held check; rid longing, fear wrath; intent Freedom. These shlokas refer yogic practices laid Yoga-sutras. A word caution necessary regarding practices. They serve yogin purpose athletics gymnastics bhogin (who pursues worldly pleasures). His physical exercises help latter keep senses enjoyment full vigour. The yogic practices help yogin keep body condition senses subjection. Men versed practices rare days, turn good account. He achieved preliminary stage path self-discipline, passion Freedom, rid pairs opposites conquered fear, would well go practices surely help him. It disciplined man alone can, practices, render body holy temple God. Purity mind body sine qua non, without processes likely, first instance, lead man astray drive deeper slough delusion. That result cases many know actual experience. That prince yogins, Patanjali gave first place yamas (cardinal vows) niyamas (casual vows), held eligible yogic practices gone preliminary discipline. The five cardinal vows are: non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy, non-possession. The five casual vows are: bodily purity, contentment, study scriptures, austerity, meditation God.   Knowing Me Acceptor sacrifice austerity, great Lord worlds, Friend creation, yogi attains peace. Chapter_six  He performs obligatory action, without depending fruit thereof, sannyasin yoginnot man neglects sacrificial fire neglects action. Fire may taken mean possible instruments action. Fire needed sacrifices used performed help. Assuming spinning means universal service age, man neglecting spinning wheel would not become sannyasi.  What called sannyasa, know thou yoga, O Pandava; none become yogin not renounced selfish purpose.  For man seeks scale heights yoga, action said means; man, scaled heights, repose said means. He purged impurities achieved even-mindedness easily achieve Self-realization. But not mean scaled heights yoga disdain work guidance world. On contrary work not breath nostrils, also natural breathing. He sheer force will. See V.   When man not attached either objects sense actions sheds selfish purpose, said scaled heights yoga.  By one's Self one raise oneself, not allow oneself fall; Atman (Self) alone friend self, Self alone self's foe.  His Self alone friend, conquered Self: not conquered inimical himself, even Self behaves foe.  Of conquered rests perfect calm self completely composed, cold heat, pleasure pain, honour dishonour.  The yogin filled contentment wisdom discriminative knowledge, firm rock, mastered senses, clod earth, stone gold same, possessed yoga.  He excels regards alike boon companion, friend, enemy, stranger, mediator, alien ally, also saint sinner.   Let yogi constantly apply thought Atman remaining alone scheduled place, mind body control, rid desires possessions.   Fixing himself, pure spot, firm seat, neither high yet low, covered kusha grass, thereon deerskin, thereon cloth;   Sitting seat, mind concentrated, functions thought sense control, set practice yoga sake self-purification.   Keeping steady, holding trunk, neck head straight line motionless, fixing eye tip nose, looking not around.   Tranquil spirit, free fear, steadfast vow brahmacharya, holding mind control, yogi sit, thoughts Me, absorbed Me. Brahmacharya (usually translated celibacy') means not sexual continence observance cardinal vows attainment Brahman.   The yogi, ever thus, mind controlled, unites Atman, wins peace culminates Nirvana, peace Me.   Yoga not eats much, fasts much, neither sleeps much, yet wakeful.   To disciplined food recreation, effort activities, sleep waking, yoga (discipline) becomes relief ills.   When one's thought, completely controlled, rests steadily Atman, one free longing objects desire, one called yogin.   As taper windless spot flickers not, even yogin, thought controlled, seeking unite Atman.   Where thought curbed practice yoga completely ceases, man sits content within himself, Atman seen Atman;   Where experiences endless bliss beyond senses grasped reason alone; wherein established swerves not Truth;   Where holds no gain greater gained; where, securely seated, not shaken calamity however great;   That state known yoga (union Supreme), disunion union pain. This yoga must one practice firm resolve unwearying zeal.   Shaking oneself completely free longings born selfish purpose; reining whole host senses, sides, mind itself;   With reason held securely will, gradually attain calm mind established Atman think nothing.   Wherever fickle unsteady mind wanders, thence reined brought sole sway Atman.   The yogin, cleansed stain, unites ever Atman, easily enjoys endless bliss contact Brahman.   The man equipped yoga looks impartial eye, seeing Atman beings beings Atman.   He sees Me everywhere everything Me, never vanishes Me I him.   The yogin who, anchored unity, worships Me abiding beings, lives moves me, no matter live move. So long self' subsists, Supreme Self absent; self' extinguished, Supreme Self seen everywhere. Also see note XIII.     He who, likening others, senses pleasure pain equally himself, deemed highest yogi, O Arjuna. Arjuna Said:   I not see, O Madhusudana, yoga, based equal-mindedness Thou hast expounded me, steadily endure, fickleness (of mind).   For fickle mind, O Krishna, unruly, overpowering stubborn; curb is, I think, hard curb wind. The Lord Said:   Undoubtedly, O Mahabahu, mind fickle hard curb; yet, O Kaunteya, held check constant practice dispassion.   Without self-restraint, yoga, I hold, difficult attain; self-governed soul attain proper means, strives it. Arjuna Said:   If one, possessed faith, slack effort, mind straying yoga, reach not perfection yoga, end come to, O Krishna?   Without foothold, floundering path Brahman fallen both, indeed not lost, O Mahabahu, like dissipated cloud?   This doubt, O Krishna, thou dispel utterly; found none thou banish doubt. The Lord Said:   Neither world, next, ruin him, O Partha; no well-doer, oh loved one, meets sad end.   Fallen yoga, man attains worlds righteous souls, dwelt numberless years born house pure gentle blood.   Or may even born family yogins, though birth rare world.   There, O Kurunandana, discovers intellectual stage reached previous birth, thence stretches forward towards perfection.   By virtue previous practice borne on, whether not, even desire know yoga passes beyond Vedic ritual.   But yogi perseveres striving, cleansed sin, perfected many births, reaches highest state.   The yogin deemed higher man austerities; deemed also higher man knowledge; higher man engrossed ritual; therefore thou yogin, O Arjuna!   And among yogins, worships Me faith, inmost self rapt Me, deemed best yogin. Chapter_seven  Hear, O Partha, how, thy mind rivetted me, practicing yoga making sole refuge, thou shalt, without doubt, know fully.  I declare thee, entirety, knowledge, combined discriminative knowledge, thou hast known remains nothing known.  Among thousands men hardly one strives perfection; among strive hardly one knows Me truth.  Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether, Mind, Reason Egothus eightfold prakriti divided. The eightfold prakriti substantially field described XIII.   perishable Being XV.    This My lower aspect; know thou My aspect, higherwhich Jiva (the Vital Essence) which, O Mahabahu, world sustained.  Know two compose source beings spring; I origin end entire universe.  There nothing higher I, O Dhananjaya; strung Me row gems upon thread.  In water I savour, O Kaunteya; sun moon I light; syllable AUM Vedas; sound ether, manliness men.  I sweet fragrance earth; brilliance fire; life beings; austerity ascetics.   Know Me, O Partha, primeval seed beings; I reason rational beings splendour splendid.   Of strong, I strength, divorced lust passion; beings I desire undivorced righteousness.   Know manifestations three gunas, sattva, rajas, tamas, proceed none Me; yet I not them; Me. God not dependent them, dependent Him. Without Him various manifestations would impossible.   Befogged manifestations three gunas, entire world fails recognize Me, imperishable, transcending them.   For My divine delusive mystery made three gunas hard pierce; make Me sole refuge pierce veil.   The deluded evil-doers, lowest men, not see refuge Me; for, reason delusive mystery, bereft knowledge given devilish ways.   Four types well-doers devoted Me, O Arjuna; are, O Bharatarshabha, afflicted, spiritual seeker, material seeker, enlightened.   Of enlightened, ever attached Me single-minded devotion, best; enlightened I exceedingly dear dear Me.   All estimable indeed, enlightened I hold My self; he, true yogi, stayed Me alone, supreme goal.   At end many births enlightened man finds refuge Me; rare indeed great soul Vasudeva all'.   Men, bereft knowledge reason various longings, seek refuge gods, pinning faith diverse rites, guided nature.   Whatever form one desires worship faith devotion, form I make faith secure.   Possessed faith seeks propitiate one, obtains therethrough longings, dispensed truth none Me.   But limited fruit falls shortsighted ones; worship gods go gods, worship Me come unto Me.   Not knowing My transcendent, imperishable, supreme character, undiscerning think Me unmanifest become manifest.   Veiled delusive mystery created My unique power, I not manifest all; bewildered world not recognize Me, birthless changeless. Having power create world sense yet unaffected it, He described unique power.   I know, O Arjuna, creatures past, present be; no one knows Me.   All creatures universe bewildered, O Parantapa, virtue delusion pairs opposite sprung likes dislikes, O Bharata.   But virtuous men whose sin come end, freed delusion pairs opposites, worship Me steadfast faith.   Those endeavour freedom age death taking refuge Me, know full Brahman, Adhyatma Karma.   Those know Me, including Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, Adhiyajna, possessed even-mindedness, know Me even time passing away. Chapter_eight  What Brahman? What Adhyatma? What Karma, O Purushottama? What called Adhibhuta? And Adhidaiva?  And body Adhiyajna how? And time death art Thou known self-controlled? The Lord Said:  The Supreme, Imperishable Brahman; manifestation Adhyatma; creative process whereby beings created called Karma.  Adhibhuta My perishable form; Adhidaivata individual self form; O best among embodied, Adhiyajna I body, purified sacrifice. That is, Imperishable Unmanifest perishable atom everything universe Supreme expression Supreme. Why mortal man arrogate authorship anything rather His bidding dedicate action Him?  And who, last hour remembering Me only, departs leaving body, enters Me; no doubt.  Or whatever form man continually contemplates, remembers hour death, form goes, O Kaunteya.  Therefore times remember Me fight on; thy mind reason Me fixed thou shalt surely come Me.  With thought steadied constant practice, wandering nowhere, meditates Supreme Celestial Being, O Partha, goes Him.  -  Whoso, time death, unwavering mind, devotion, fixing breath rightly brows power yoga, meditates Sage, Ancient, Ruler, subtler subtlest, Supporter all, Inconceivable, glorious sun beyond darkness,he goes Supreme Celestial Being.   That knowers Vedas call Imperishable (or word knowers Vedas repeat), wherein ascetics freed passion enter desiring practice brahmacharya, Goal (or Word) I declare thee brief.   Closing gates, locking mind hridaya, fixing breath within head, rapt yogic meditation;   Whoso departs leaving body uttering AUMBrahman one syllablerepeatedly thinking Me, reaches highest state.   That yogi easily wins Me, O Partha, who, ever attached Me, constantly remembers Me undivided mind.   Great souls, come Me, reach highest perfection; come not birth, unlasting (withal) abode misery.   From world Brahma down, worlds subject return, O Arjuna; coming Me no rebirth.   Those men indeed know Day Night, know Brahma's day lasts thousand yugas night thousand yugas long. That say, day night dozen hours less infinitesimal fraction moment vast cycle time. Pleasures pursued incalculably small moments illusory mirage. Rather waste brief moments, devote serving God service mankind. On hand, time small drop ocean eternity fail object here, viz. Self-realization, need not despair. She bide time.   At coming Day manifest spring forth Unmanifest, coming Night dissolved Unmanifest. Knowing too, man understand little power things, round birth death ceaseless.   This multitude creatures come birth, O Partha, again; dissolved coming Night, whether not; break Day re-born.   But higher Unmanifest another Unmanifest Being, everlasting, perisheth not creatures perish.   This Unmanifest, named Imperishable, declared highest goal. For reach no return. That highest abode.   This Supreme Being, O Partha, may undivided devotion; It beings dwell, It pervaded.   Now I tell thee, Bharatarshabha, conditions determine exemption return, also return, yogins pass away hence.   Fire, Light, Day, Bright Fortnight, six months Northern Solsticethrough departing men knowing Brahman go Brahman.   Smoke, Night, Dark Fortnight, six months Southern SolsticeTherethrough yogin attains lunar light thence returns. I not understand meaning two shlokas. They not seem consistent teaching Gita. The Gita teaches whose heart meek devotion, devoted unattached action seen Truth must win salvation, no matter dies. These shlokas seem run counter this. They may perhaps stretched mean broadly man sacrifice, man light, man known Brahman finds release birth retains enlightenment time death, contrary man none attributes goes world moonnot lastingand returns birth. The moon, all, shines borrowed light.   These two pathsbright darkare deemed eternal paths world; one man goes return not, returns again. The Bright one may taken mean path knowledge dark one ignorance.   The Yogin knowing two paths falls not delusion, O Partha; therefore, times, O Arjuna, remain steadfast yoga. \"Will not fall delusion\" means knows two paths known secret even-mindedness not take path ignorance.   Whatever fruit good deeds laid accruing (a study of) Vedas, sacrifices, austerities, acts charityall yogin transcends, knowing this, reaches Supreme Primal Abode. He achieved even-mindedness dint devotion, knowledge service not obtains fruit good actions, also wins salvation. Chapter_nine  I declare thee, art uncensorious, mysterious knowledge, together discriminative knowledge, knowing thou shalt released ill.  This king sciences, king mysteries, pure sovereign, capable direct comprehension, essence dharma, easy practice, changeless.  Men no faith doctrine, O Parantapa, far coming Me, return repeatedly path world death.  By Me, unmanifest form, whole world pervaded; beings Me, I not them.  And yet beings not Me. That indeed My unique power Lord! Sustainer beings, I not them; My Self brings existence. The sovereign power God lies mystery, miracle, beings Him yet not Him, He yet not them. This description God language mortal man. Indeed He soothes man revealing His aspects using kinds paradoxes. All beings inasmuch creation His; He transcends all, He really not author all, may said equal truth beings not Him. He really His true devotees, He not, according them, deny Him. What not mystery, miracle God?  As mighty wind, moving everywhere, ever contained ether, even know beings contained Me.  All beings, O Kaunteya, merge prakriti, end kalpa, I send forth kalpa begins.  Resorting prakriti, I send forth multitude beings, powerless sway prakriti.  But activity, O Dhananjaya, not bind Me, seated one indifferent, unattached it.   With Presiding Witness, prakriti gives birth moves not move; this, O Kaunteya, wheel world keeps going.   Not knowing My transcendent nature sovereign Lord beings, fools condemn Me incarnated man. For deny existence God not recognize Director human body.   Vain hopes, actions knowledge witless ones resorted delusive nature monsters devils.   But great souls resort divine nature, O Partha, know Me Imperishable Source beings worship Me undivided mind.   Always declaring My glory, striving steadfast faith, Me devout homage; ever attached Me, worship Me.   Yet others, knowledge-sacrifice, worship Me, seen everywhere, one, different many.   I sacrificial vow; I sacrifice; I ancestral oblation; I herb; I sacred text; I clarified butter; I fire; I burnt offering.   Of universe I Father, Mother, Creator, Grandsire: I known, sacred syllable AUM; rig, Saman Yajus;   I Goal, Sustainer, Lord, Witness, Abode, Refuge, Friend; Origin, End Preservation, Treasurehouse, Imperishable Seed.   I give heat; I hold back pour forth rain; I deathlessness also death. O Arjuna, Being not-Being well.   Followers three Vedas, drink soma juice purged sin, worship Me sacrifice pray going heaven; reach holy world gods enjoy heaven divine joys gods. The reference sacrificial ceremonies rites vogue days Gita. We cannot definitely say like soma juice exactly was.   They enjoy vast world heaven, merit spent, enter world mortals; who, following Vedic law, long fruit action earn round birth death.   As worship Me, thinking Me alone nothing else, ever attached Me, I bear burden getting need. There three unmistakable marks true yogi bhaktaeven-mindedness, skill action, undivided devotion. These three must completely harmonized yogi. Without devotion no even-mindedness, without even-mindedness no devotion, without skill action devotion even-minded might well pretense.   Even who, devoted gods, worship full faith, even they, O Kaunteya, worship none Me, though not according rule. Not according rule' means not knowing Me Impersonal Absolute.   For I Acceptor Director sacrifices; not recognizing Me I am, go astray.   Those worship gods go gods; worship manes go manes; worship spirits go spirits; worship Me come Me.   Any offering leaf, flower, fruit water, made Me devotion, earnest soul, I lovingly accept. That say, Lord every serve devotion accepts service.   Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest sacrifice gift, whatever austerity thou dost perform, O kaunteya, dedicate Me.   So thou shalt released bondage action, yielding good evil fruit; accomplished renunciation performance, thou shalt released (from birth death) come unto Me.   I beings; Me non disfavoured, none favoured; worship Me devotion Me I them.   A sinner, howsoever great, turns Me undivided devotion, must indeed counted saint; settled resolve. The undivided devotion subdues passions evil deeds.   For soon becomes righteous wins everlasting peace; know certainty, O kaunteya, bhakta never perishes.   For finding refuge Me, even though born womb sin, women, vaishyas, shudras too, reach supreme goal.   How much then, pure brahmanas seer-kings devotees? Do thou worship Me, therefore, since thou hast come fleeting joyless world.   On Me fix thy mind, Me bring thy devotion, Me offer thy sacrifice, Me make thy obeisance; attached thyself Me made Me thy end aim, Me indeed shalt thou come. Chapter_ten  Yet more, O Mahabahu, My supreme word, I utter thee, gratified one, thy benefit.  Neither gods great seers know My origin; I am, every way, origin both.  He knows Me, great lord worlds, birthless without beginning, among mortals, undeluded, released sins.  Discernment, knowledge, freedom delusion, long suffering, truth, self-restraint, inward calm, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear fearlessness;  Non-violence, even-mindedness, contentment, austerity, beneficence, good ill fame,all various attributes creatures proceed verily Me.  The seven great seers, ancient four, Manus born Me My mind, born creatures world.  He knows truth My immanence My yoga becomes gifted unshakable yoga; no doubt.  I source all, proceeds me; knowing this, wise worship Me hearts full devotion.  With thoughts, whole soul devoted Me, teaching one another, ever lips, live contentment joy.   To these, ever tune Me worshipping affectionate devotion, I give power selfless action, whereby come Me.   Out every compassion them, I dwell hearts, destroy darkness, born ignorance, refulgent lamp knowledge. Arjuna Said:   Lord! Thou art supreme Brahman, supreme Abode, supreme Purifier! Everlasting Celestial Being, Primal God, Unborn, All-pervading.   Thus seersthe divine seer Narada, Asita, Devala, Vyasadeclared Thee; Thou Thyself dost tell so.   All Thou tellest true, I know, O Keshava, verily, Lord, neither gods demons know Thy manifestation.   Thyself alone Thou knowest Thyself, O Purushottama, O Source Lord beings, God Gods, O Ruler universe.   Indeed Thou oughtest tell Thy manifestations, without remainder, whereby Thou dost pervade worlds.   O Yogin! constantly meditating Thee, I know Thee? In various aspects I think Thee, O Lord?   Recount yet again, full detail, Thy unique power Thy immanence, O Janardana! For ears cannot sated listening Thy life-giving words. The Lord Said:   Yea, I unfold thee, O Kurushreshtha, My divine manifestations,the chiefest only; no limit extent.   I Atman, O Gudakesha, seated heart every being; I beginning, middle end beings.

All-seizing Death I, source things be; feminine virtues I Kirti (glory), Shri (beauty), Vak (speech), Smriti (memory), Medha (intelligence), Dhriti (constancy) Kshama (forgiveness).   Of Saman hymns I Brihat Saman; metres, Gayatri; months I Margashirsha; seasons, spring.   Of deceivers I dice-play; splendid splendour; I victory, I resolution, I goodness good. The dice-play deceivers' need not alarm one. For good evil nature things not matter question, directing immanent power God described. Let deceivers also know God's rule judgment put away pride deceit.   Of Vrishnis I Vasudeva; Pandavas Dhananjaya; ascetics I Vyasa; seers, Ushanas.   I rod punish; strategy seeking victory; secret things I silence, knowledge know.   Whatever seed every being, O Arjuna, I; nothing, whether moving fixed, without Me.   no end divine manifestations; extent I told thee way illustration.   Whatever glorious, beautiful mighty know thou issued fragment My splendour.   But needest thou learn great length, O Arjuna? With part Myself I stand upholding universe. Chapter_eleven  Out Thy grace towards me, thou hast told supreme mystery revealing knowledge Supreme; banished delusion.  Of origin destruction beings I heard Thee full detail, also Thy imperishable ajesty [sic], O Kamala-patraksha!  Thou art indeed Thou hast described Thyself, Parameshvara! I crave behold, now, form Thine Ishvara.  If, Lord, thou thinkest possible bear sight, reveal me, O Yogeshvara, Thy imperishable form. The Lord Said:  Behold, O Partha, forms divine hundreds thousands, infinitely diverse, infinitely various color aspect.  Behold Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, two Ashwins, Maruts; behold, O Bharata, numerous marvels never revealed before.  Behold today, O Gudakesha, body, whole universe, moving unmoving, one, whatever else thou cravest see.  But thou canst not see Me thine eyes. I give thee eye divine; behold My sovereign power! Sanjaya Said:  With words, O King, great Lord Yoga, Hari, revealed Partha His supreme form Ishvara.   With many mouths many eyes, many wondrous aspects, many divine ornaments, many brandished weapons divine.   Wearing divine garlands vestments, annointed divine perfumes, form God, all-marvellous [sic], infinite, seen everywhere.   Were splendour thousand suns shoot forth sky might perchance resemble splendour Mighty One.   Then Pandava see whole universe manifold divisions gathered one body God gods.   Then Dhananjaya, wonderstruck thrilled every fibre being, bowed low head Lord, addressing Him folded hands. Arjuna Said:   With Thy form, O Lord, I see gods diverse multitudes beings, Lord Brahma, lotus-throne seers serpents divine.   With many arms bellies, mouths eyes, I see Thy infinite form everywhere. Neither Thy end, middle, beginning, I see, O Lord Universe, Universal-formed!   With crown mace disc, mass effulgence, gleaming everywhere I see Thee, dazzling sight, bright splendour fiery sun blazing sides,incomprehensible.   Thou art Supreme Imperishable worthy known; Thou art final resting place universe; Thou art changeless guardian Eternal Dharma; Thou art, I believe, Everlasting Being.   Thou hast no beginning, middle end; infinite Thy might; arms innumerable; eyes, sun moon; Thy mouth blazing fire, overpowering universe Thy radiance.   By Thee alone filled spaces heaven earth quarters; sight Thy wondrous terrible form, three worlds sore oppressed, O Mahatman!   Here, too, multitudes gods seen enter Thee; awe-struck praise Thee folded arms; hosts great seers siddhas, All Hail' lips, hymn Thee songs praise.   The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, gods, twin Ashwins, Maruts, Manes, hosts Gandharvas, Yakshas, Asuras Siddhasall gaze Thee wonderment.   At sight thy mighty form, O Mahabahu, many-mouthed, eyes, arms, thighs feet innumerable, many vast bellies, terrible many jaws, worlds feel fearfully oppressed, I.   For I behold Thee touching sky, glowing, numerous-hued gaping mouths wide resplendent eyes, I feel oppressed innermost being; no peace quiet I find, O Vishnu!   As I see Thy mouths fearful jaws, resembling Fire Doom, I lose sense direction, find no relief. Be gracious, O Devesha, O Jagannivasa!   All sons Dhritarashtra, crowd kings, Bhishma, Drona, Karna too, also chief warriors   Are hastening fearful jaws Thy terrible mouths. Some indeed, caught Thy teeth, seen, heads crushed atoms.   As rivers, numerous torrents, run head-long sea, even heroes world men rush Thy flaming mouths.   As moths, fast-flying, plunge blazing fire, straight doom, even rush headlong Thy mouths, destruction.   Devouring sides, Thou lappest Thy flaming tongues; Thy fierce rays blaze forth, filling whole universe lustre.   Tell me, Lord, Thou art dread form! Hail Thee, O Devavara! Be gracious! I desire know Thee, Primal Lord; I comprehend not Thou dost. The Lord Said:   Doom I, full-ripe, dealing death worlds, engaged devouring mankind. Even without slaying not one warriors, ranged battle thee, survive.   Therefore, thou arise, win renown! Defeat thy foes enjoy thriving kingdom. By Me already destroyed; thou no instrument, O Savyasachin!   Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha Karna, also warrior chiefsalready slain Meslay thou! Fight! Victory thine foes field. Sanjaya Said:   Hearing world Keshava, crown-wearer Arjuna folded hands, trembling made obeisance. Bowing hesitant, faltering accents, proceeded address Krishna more. Arjuna Said:   Right proper is, O Hrishikesha, Thy praise stir world gladness tender emotion; Rakshasas fear fly every quarter hosts Siddhas reverent homage.   And not bow Thee, O Mahatma? Thou art First Creator, greater even Brahma. O Ananta, O Devesha, O Jagannivasa, Thou art Imperishable, Being, not-Being, That transcends even these.   Thou art Primal God, Ancient Being; Thou art Final Resting Place Universe; Thou art Knower, to-be-known', Supreme Abode; Thee, O Myriad-formed, universe pervaded.   Thou art Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, Shashanka, Prajapati, Prapitamaha! All Hail Thee, thousand times hail! Again yet hail Thee!   All hail Thee behind! hail Thee every side, O All; Thy prowess infinite, Thy might measureless! Thou holdest all; therefore Thou art all.   If ever carelessness, thinking Thee comrade, I addressed Thee saying, O Krishna!', O Yadava!' not knowing Thy greatness, negligence affection,   If ever I rude Thee jest, whilst play, rest-time, meals, whilst alone company, O Achyuta, forgive Thou faultI beg Thee, O Incomprehensible!   Thou art Father world, moving un-moving; thou art adored, worthiest, Master; none equal Thee; greater Thee? Thy power matchless three worlds.   Therefore, I prostrate Thee, beseech Thy grace, O Lord adorable! As father son, comrade comrade, shouldst Thou bear, beloved Lord, me, Thy loved one.   I filled joy see never seen before, yet heart oppressed fear. Show original form Thine, O Lord! Be gracious, Devesha, O Jagannivasa!   I crave see Thee even Thou wast, crown, mace, disc hand; wear Thou, more, four-armed form, O thousand-armed Vishvamurti! The Lord Said:   It favour thee, O Arjuna, I revealed thee, My unique power, My form Supreme, Resplendent, Universal, Infinite, Primalwhich none save thee ever seen.   Not study Vedas, not sacrifice, not study scriptures, not gifts, yet performance rites fierce austerities I, form, seen one save thee world men, O Kurupravira!   Be thou neither oppressed bewildered look awful form Mine. Banish thy fear, ease thy mind, lo! behold Me I was. Sanjaya Said.   So said Vasudeva Arjuna, revealed His original form. Wearing His form benign, Mahatma consoled terrified. Arjuna Said.   Beholding thy benign human form I come normal state. The Lord Said:   Very hard behold form Mine thou hast seen; even gods always yearn see it.   Not Vedas, not penance, gifts, yet sacrifice, behold Me form thou hast seen.   But single-minded devotion, O Arjuna, I may form known seen, truly entered into, O Parantapa!   He alone comes me, O Pandava, My work, made Me goal, My devotee, renounced attachment, ill-will toward none. Chapter_twelve  Of devotees worship Thee, incessantly attached, worship Imperishable Unmanifest, better yogins? The Lord Said:  Those I regard best yogins who, riveting minds Me, ever attached, worship Me, highest faith.  But worship Imperishable, indefinable, Unmanifest, Omnipresent, Unthinkable, Rock-seated, Immovable, Unchanging,  Keeping whole host senses complete control, looking impartial eye, engrossed welfare beingsthese come indeed Me.  Greater travail whose mind fixed Unmanifest; hard embodied mortals gain UnmanifestGoal. Mortal man imagine Unmanifest, Impersonal, language fails often negatively describes It Neti', Neti' (Not That, Not That). And even iconoclasts bottom no better idol-worshippers. To worship book, go church, pray one's face particular directionall forms worshipping Formless image idol. And yet, idol-breaker idol-worshipper cannot lose sight fact something beyond form, Unthinkable, Formless, Impersonal, Changeless. The highest goal devotee become one object devotion. The bhakta extinguishes merges into, becomes, Bhagvan. This state best reached devoting oneself form, said short cut Unmanifest really longest difficult.  But casting actions Me, making Me all, worship Me meditation undivided devotion,  Of such, whose thoughts centered Me, O Partha, I become ere long Deliverer ocean world death.  On Me set thy mind, Me rest thy conviction; without doubt shalt thou remain Me hereafter.  If thou canst not set thy mind steadily Me, method constant practice seek win Me, O Dhananjaya.   If thou art also unequal method constant practice, concentrate service Me; even serving Me thou shalt attain perfection.   If thou art unable even this, dedicating Me, mind controlled, abandon fruit action.   Better knowledge practice, better knowledge concentration, better concentration renunciation fruit action, directly issues peace. Practice' (abhyasa) practice yoga meditation control psychic processes; knowledge' (jnana) intellectual effort; concentration' (dhyana) devoted worship. If result no renunciation fruit action, practice' no practice', knowledge' no knowledge', concentration' no concentration'.   Who ill-will towards none, friendly compassionate, shed thought mine' I', regards pain pleasure alike, long-suffering;   Who ever content, gifted yoga, self-restrained, firm conviction, dedicated mind reason Methat devotee (bhakta) Mine dear Me.   Who gives no trouble world, world causes no trouble, free exultation, resentment, fear vexation,that man dear Me.   Who expects naught, pure, resourceful, unconcerned, untroubled, indulges no undertakings,that devotee Mine dear Me.   Who rejoices not, neither frets grieves, covets not, abandons good illthat devotee Mine dear Me.   Who foe friend, regards alike respect disrespect, cold heat, pleasure pain, free attachment;   Who weighs equal scale blame praise, silent, content whatever lot, owns no home, steady mind,that devotee Mine dear Me.   They follow essence dharma, I told it, faith, keeping Me goal,those devotees exceeding dear Me. Chapter_thirteen  This body, O Kaunteya, called Field; knows called knower Field know.  And understand Me be, O Bharata, knower Field Fields; knowledge Field knower Field, I hold, true knowledge.  What Field is, nature, modifications, whence what, also He is, His powerhear briefly Me.  This subject sung seers distinctively various ways, different hymns also aphoristic texts Brahman well reasoned unequivocal.  The great elements, Individuation, Reason, Unmanifest, ten senses, one (mind), five spheres senses;  Desire, dislike, pleasure, pain, association, consciousness, cohesionthis, sum, called Field modifications. The great elements Earth, Water, Fire, Air Ether. Individuation' thought I, body I'; Unmanifest' prakriti maya; ten senses five senses perceptionsmell, taste, sight, touch hearing, five organs action, viz.: hands, feet, tongue, two organs excretion. The five spheres objects senses smell, savour, form, touch, sound. Association' property different organs co-operate. Dhriti not patience constancy cohesion, i.e. property atoms body hold together; individuation' springs cohesion. Individuation inherent unmanifest prakriti. The undeluded man cast individuation ego, done shock inevitable thing like death pairs opposites caused sense-contacts fail affect him. The Field, subject modifications, abandoned end enlightened unenlightened alike.  Freedom pride pretentiousness, nonviolence, forgiveness, uprightness, service Master, purity, steadfastenes, self-restraint;  Aversion sense-objects, absence conceit, realization painfulness evil birth, death, age disease;  Absence attachment, refusal wrapped one's children, wife, home family, even-mindedness whether good ill befall;   Unwavering all-exclusive devotion Me, resort secluded spots, distaste haunts men;   Settled conviction nature Atman, perception goal knowledge Truth, All declared Knowledge reverse ignorance.   I (now) expound thee known knowing one enjoys immortality; supreme Brahman no beginning, called neither Being non-Being. The Supreme described neither Being non-Being. It beyond definition description, attributes.   Everywhere hands feet, everywhere eyes, heads, mouths, everywhere ears, It abides embracing everything universe.   Seeming possess functions senses, It devoid senses; It touches naught, upholds all; no gunas, It experiences gunas.   Without beings, yet within; immovable yet moving, subtle It cannot perceived; far yet near It is. He knows It within It, close It; mobility immobility, peace restlessness, owe It, It motion yet motionless.   Undivided, It seems subsist divided beings; BrahmanThat known Sustainer all, yet It Devourer Creator.   Light lights, It said beyond darkness; It knowledge, object knowledge, gained knowledge; It seated hearts all.   Thus I expounded brief Field, Knowledge That known; My devotee, knows this, worthy become one Me.   Know Prakriti Purusha without beginning; know modifications gunas born Prakriti.   Prakriti described cause creation effects causes; Purusha described cause experiencing pleasure pain.   For Purusha, residing Prakriti, experiences gunas born Prakriti; attachment gunas cause birth good evil wombs. Prakriti common parlance Maya. Purusha Jiva. Jiva acting accordance nature experiences fruit actions arising three gunas.   What called body Witness, Assentor, Sustainer, Experiencer, Great Lord also Supreme Atman, Supreme Being.   He knows Purusha Prakriti gunas, not born again, no matter live move.   Some meditation hold Atman self; others Sankhya Yoga, others Karma Yoga.   Yet others, not knowing (Him) thus, worship (Him) heard others; pass beyond death, devoted adherence heard.   Wherever something born, animate inanimate, know thou Bharatarshabha, issues union Field Knower Field.   Who sees abiding beings Parameshvara, imperishable perishable, sees indeed.   When sees Ishvara abiding everywhere alike, not hurt hence attains highest goal. He sees God everywhere merges Him sees naught else; not yield passion, not become foe attains Freedom.   Who sees Prakriti performs actions (knows) Atman performs not, sees indeed. Just as, case man asleep, \"Self\" not agent sleep, Prakriti, even enlightened man detach \"Self\" activities. pure everything pure. Prakriti not unchaste, arrogant man takes wife twain passion born.   When sees diversity beings founded unity whole expanse issuing therefrom, attains Brahman. To realize everything rests Brahman attain state Brahman. Then Jiva becomes Shiva.   This imperishable Supreme Atman, O Kaunteya, though residing body, acts not not stained, no beginning no gunas.   As all-pervading ether, reason subtlety, not soiled even Atman pervading every part body not soiled.   As one Sun illumines whole universe, even Master Field illumines whole field, O Bharata!   Those who, eyes knowledge, perceive distinction Field Knower Field, (the secret) release beings Prakriti, attain Supreme. Chapter_fourteen  Yet I expound highest best knowledge, knowing sages passed hence highest perfection.  By recourse knowledge became one Me. They need not come birth even creation, suffer dissolution.  The great prakriti womb I deposit germ; beings come birth, O Bharata.  Whatever forms take birth various species, great prakriti Mother I seed-giving Father.  Sattva, rajas tamas gunas sprung prakriti; they, O Mahabahu, keep imperishable Dweller bound body.  Of sattva, stainless, light-giving healing; binds bond happiness bond knowledge, O sinless one.  Rajas, know thou, nature passion, source thirst attachment; keeps man bound bond action.  Tamas, know thou, born ignorance, mortal man's delusion; keeps bound heedlessness, sloth slumber, O Bharata.  Sattva attaches man happiness, rajas action, tamas, shrouding knowledge, attaches heedlessness.   Sattva prevails, O Bharata, overcome rajas tamas; rajas, overpowered sattva tamas; likewise tamas reigns sattva rajas crushed.   When lightknowledgeshines forth al gates body, may known sattva thrives.   Greed, activity, assumption undertakings, restlessness, cravingthese evidence rajas flourishes, O Bharatarshabha.   Ignorance, dullness, heedlessness, delusionthese evidence tamas reigns, O Kurunandana.   If embodied one meets end whilst sattva prevails, attains spotless worlds knowers Highest.   If dies reign within rajas, born among men attached action; dies tamas, born species not endowed reason.   The fruit sattvika action said stainless merit. That rajas pain tamas ignorance.   Those abiding sattva rise upwards, rajas stay midway, tamas sink downwards.   seer perceives no agent gunas, knows Him gunas, attains My being. As soon man realizes not doer, gunas agent, self' vanishes, goes actions spontaneously, sustain body. And body meant subserve highest end, actions even reveal detachment dispassion. Such seer easily glimpse One gunas offer devotion Him.   When embodied one transcends three gunas born contact body, released pain birth, death age attains deathlessness. Arjuna Said:   What, O Lord, marks transcended three gunas? How conduct himself? How transcend three gunas? The Lord Said:   He, O Pandava, not disdain light, activity, delusion come being, desires vanish;   He, seated one indifferent, not shaken gunas, stays still moves not, knowing gunas playing parts;   He holds pleasure pain alike, sedate, regards earth, stone gold, wise weighs equal scale things pleasant unpleasant, even-minded praise blame;   Who holds alike respect disrespect, friend foe, indulges no undertakingsThat man called gunatita. Shls.   -   must read considered together. Light activity delusion, seen foregoing shlokas, products indications sattva, rajas tamas respectively. The inner meaning verses transcended gunas unaffected them. A stone not desire light, disdain activity inertness; still, without so. If someone puts motion, not fret; again, allowed lie still, not feel inertness delusion seized it. The difference stone gunatita latter full consciousness full knowledge shakes free bonds bind ordinary mortal. He has, result knowledge, achieved purpose stone. Like stone witness, not doer, activities gunas prakriti. Of jnani one may say sitting still, unshaken knowledge gunas playing parts. We every moment lives acting though doers imagine state, hardly experience it. But hitch waggon star work way closer closer towards gradually withdrawing self actions. A gunatita experience condition cannot describe it, describe ceases one. The moment proceeds so, self' peeps in. The peace light bustle inertness common experience illusory. The Gita made clear many words sattvika state one nearest gunatita. Therefore every one strive develop sattva himself, believing day reach goal state gunatita.   He serves unwavering exclusive bhaktiyoga transcends gunas worthy become one Brahman.   For I image Brahman, changeless deathless, also everlasting dharma perfect bliss. Chapter_fifteen  With root branches below, ashvattha tree, say, impossible; Vedic hymns leaves; knows knows Vedas. Shvah means tomorrow, ashvattha (na shvopi sthata) means not last even tomorrow, i.e. world sense every moment state flux. But even though perpetually changing, root Brahman Supreme, imperishable. It protection support leaves Vedic hymns, i.e. dharma. He knows world sense knows dharma real jnani, man really known Vedas.  Above branches spread, blossoming gunas, shoots sense-objects; deep world men ramified roots, shape consequences action. This description tree world sense unenlightened see it. They fail discover Root Brahman always attached objects sense. They water tree three gunas remain bound Karman world men.  Its form not perceived, neither end, beginning, basis. Let man first hew deep-rooted Ashvattha sure weapon detachment;  Let pray win no return seek find refuge primal Being emanated ancient world action. Detachment shl.   means dispassion, aversion objects senses. Unless man determined cut temptations world sense go deeper mire every day. These verses show one dare not play objects senses impunity.  To imperishable enlightened souls gowho without pride delusion, triumphed taints attachment, ever tune Supreme, whose passions died, exempt pairs opposites, pleasure pain.  Neither sun, moon, fire illumine it; men arrive return notthat My supreme abode.  As part indeed Myself eternal Jiva world life, attracts mind five senses place prakriti.  When master (of body) acquires body discards carries wherever goes, even wind carries scents flower beds.  Having settled sensesear, eye, touch, taste, smellas well mind, frequents objects. These objects natural objects senses. The frequenting enjoyment would tainted sense I' it; otherwise pure, even child's enjoyment objects innocent.   The deluded perceive Him not He leaves settles (a body) enjoys (sense objects) association gunas; endowed eye knowledge alone see Him.   Yogins strive see Him seated themselves; witless ones not cleansed see Him not, even though strive.   The light sun illumines whole universe moon firethat light, know thou, Mine;   It I, penetrating earth uphold beings My strength, becoming moonthe essence sapnourish herbs;   It I becoming Vaishvanara Fire entering bodies breathe, assimilate four kinds food help outward inward breaths.   And I seated hearts all, Me proceed memory, knowledge dispelling doubts; I known Vedas, I, author Vedanta knower Vedas.   There two Beings world: kshara (perishable) akshara (imperishable). Kshara embraces creatures permanent basis akshara.   The Supreme Being surely anothercalled Paramatman Imperishable Ishvara pervades supports three worlds.   Because I transcend kshara also higher akshara, I known world Vedas Purushottama (the Highest Being).   He who, undeluded, knows Me Purushottama, knows all, worships Me heart, O Bharata.   Thus I revealed thee, sinless one, mysterious shastra; understands this, O Bharata, man understanding, fulfilled life's mission. Chapter_sixteen  Fearlessness, purity heart, steadfastness jnana yogaknowledge action, beneficence, self-restraint, sacrifice, spiritual study, austerity, uprightness;  Non-violence, truth, slowness wrath, spirit dedication, serenity, aversion slander, tenderness lives, freedom greed, gentleness, modesty, freedom levity;  Spiritedness, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom ill-will arrogancethese found one born divine heritage, O Bharata.  Pretentiousness, arrogance, self-conceit, wrath, coarseness, ignorancethese found one born devilish heritage.  The divine heritage makes Freedom, devilish bondage. Grieve not, O Partha; thou art born divine heritage.  There two orders created beings worldthe divine devilish; divine order described detail, hear Me devilish, O Partha.  Men devil not know may may not do; neither purity, right conduct, truth found them.  Without truth, without basis, without God universe,' say; born union sexes, prompted naught lust.'  Holding view, depraved souls, feeble understanding fierce deeds, come forth enemies world destroy it.   Given insatiable lust, possessed pretentiousness, arrogance conceit, seize wicked purposes delusion, go pledged uncleaned deeds.   Given boundless cares end death, making indulgence lust sole goal, convinced all;   Caught myriad snares hope, slaves lust wrath, speak unlawfully amass wealth satisfaction appetites.   This I gained today; aspiration I attain; wealth mine; likewise mine hereafter;   This enemy I already slain, others also I slay; lord I; enjoyment mine, perfection mine, strength mine, happiness mine;   Wealthy I, high-born. What like unto me? I perform sacrifice! I give alms! I merry!' Thus think they, ignorance deluded;   And tossed diverse fancies, caught net delusion, stuck deep indulgence appetites, foul hell fall.   Wise conceit, stubborn, full intoxication pelf pride, offer nominal sacrifices show, contrary rule.   Given pride, force, arrogance, lust wrath deriders indeed, scorning Me other' bodies.   These cruel scorners, lowest mankind vile, I hurl again, devilish wombs.   Doomed devilish wombs, deluded ones, far ever coming Me, sink lower lower birth birth.   Three-fold gate hell, leading man perditionLust, Wrath, Greed; three, therefore, shunned.   The man escapes three gates Darkness, O Kaunteya, works welfare thence reaches highest state.   He forsakes rule shastra bidding selfish desires, gains neither perfection, happiness, highest state. Shastra not mean rites formulae laid so-called dharmashastra, path self-restraint laid seers saints.   Therefore let shastra thy authority determining ought done ought not done; ascertain thou rule shastra thy task (accordingly). Shastra meaning preceding shloka. Let no one law unto himself, take authority law laid men known lived religion. Chapter_seventeen  What, then, O Krishna, position forsake rule Shastra yet worship faith? Do act sattva rajas tamas? The Lord Said:  Threefold faith men, expression nature case; sattvika, rajas tamasa. Hear thou it.  The faith every man accord innate character; man made faith; whatever object faith, even he.  Sattvika persons worship gods; rajas ones, Yakshas Rakshasas; othersmen tamasworship manes spirits.  Those men who, wedded pretentiousness arrogance, possessed violence lust passion, practice fierce austerity not ordained shastra;  They, whilst torture several elements make bodies, torture Me dwelling them; know unholy resolves.  Of three kinds food dear each; also sacrifice, austerity, charity. Hear differ.  Victuals add one's years, vitality, strength, health, happiness appetite; savoury, rich, substantial inviting, dear sattvika.  Victuals bitter, sour, salty, over-hot, spicy, dry, burning, causing pain, bitterness disease, dear rajasa.   Food become cold, insipid, putrid, stale, discarded unfit sacrifice, dear tamasa.   That sacrifice sattvika willingly offered duty without desire fruit according rule.   But sacrifice offered eye fruit vain glory, know, O Bharatashreshtha, rajasa.   Sacrifice contrary rule, produces no food, lacks sacred text, involves no giving up, devoid faith said tamasa.   Homage gods, Brahmanas, gurus wise men; cleanliness, uprightness, brahmacharya non-violencethese constitute austerity (tapas) body.   Words cause no hurt, true loving helpful, spiritual study constitute austerity speech.   Serenity, benignity, silence, self-restraint, purity spiritthese constitute austerity mind.   This threefold austerity practiced perfect faith men not desirous fruit, disciplined, said sattvika.   Austerity practiced eye gain praise, honour homage ostentation said rajasa; fleeting unstable.   Austerity practiced foolish obsession, either torture oneself procure another's ruin, called tamasa.   Charity, given matter duty, without expectation return, right place time, right person said sattvika.   Charity, given either hope receiving return, view winning merit, grudgingly, declared rajasa.   Charity given wrong place time, undeserving recipient disrespectfully contempt declared tamasa.   AUM TAT SAT declared threefold name Brahman name created old Brahmanas, Vedas sacrifices.   Therefore, AUM ever lips, rites sacrifice, charity austerity, performed always rule, Brahmavadins.   With utterance TAT without desire fruit several rites sacrifice, austerity charity performed seeking Freedom.   SAT employed sense real' good'; O Partha, SAT also applied beautiful deeds.   Constancy sacrifice, austerity charity, called SAT; work purposes also SAT. The substance last four shlokas every action done spirit complete dedication God. For AUM alone Reality. That dedicated It counts.   Whatever done, O Partha, way sacrifice, charity austerity work, called Asat done without faith. It counts naught hereafter here. Chapter_eighteen  Mahabahu! I would fain learn severally secret sannyasa tyaga, O Hrishikesha, O Keshinishudana. The Lord Said:  Renunciation actions springing selfish desire known sannyasa seers; abandonment fruit action called tyaga wise.  Some thoughtful persons say: All action abandoned evil'; others say: Action sacrifice, charity austerity not relinquished'.  Hear decision matter tyaga, O Bharatasattama; tyaga, too, O mightiest men, described three kinds.  Action sacrifice, charity austerity may not abandoned; must needs performed. Sacrifice, charity austerity purifiers wise.  But even actions performed abandoning attachment fruit; such, O Partha, best considered opinion.  It not right renounce one's allotted task; abandonment, delusion, said tamasa.  He abandons action, deeming painful fear straining limbs, never gain fruit abandonment, abandonment rajasa.  But allotted task performed sense duty abandonment attachment fruit, O Arjuna, abandonment deemed sattvika.   Neither disdain unpleasant action, cling pleasant actionthis wise man full sattva, practices abandonment, shaken doubts.   For embodied one cannot completely abandon action; abandons fruit action named tyagi.   To not practice abandonment accrues, pass away, fruit action three kinds: disagreeable, agreeable, mixed; never sannyasins.   Learn, me, O Mahabahu, five factors mentioned Sankhyan doctrine accomplishment action:   The field, doer, various means, several different operations, fifth last, Unseen.   Whatever action, right wrong, man undertakes body, speech mind, five factors thereof.   This so, who, reason unenlightened intellect, sees unconditioned Atman agentsuch man dense unseeing.   He free sense I', whose motive untainted, slays not bound, even though slay worlds. This shloka though seemingly somewhat baffling not really so. The Gita many occasions presents ideal attain aspirant strive may not possible completely realize world. It like definitions geometry. A perfect straight line not exist, necessary imagine order prove various propositions. Even so, necessary hold ideals nature standards imitation matters conduct. This would seem meaning shloka: He made ashes self', whose motive untainted, may slay whole world, will. But reality annihilated self' annihilated flesh too, whose motive untainted sees past, present future. Such one oneGod. He acts yet no doer, slays yet no slayer. For mortal man royal roadthe conduct worthyis ever him, viz. ahimsaholding life sacred.   Knowledge, object knowledge, knower compose threefold urge action; means, action doer compose threefold sum action.   Knowledge, action, doer three kinds according different gunas; hear thou these, described science gunas.   Know knowledge whereby one sees beings immutable entitya unity diversityto sattvika.   That knowledge perceives separately beings several entities diverse kinds, know thou rajasa.   And knowledge which, without reason, clings one single thing, though everything, misses true essence superficial tamasa.   That action called sattvika which, one's allotted task, performed without attachment, without like dislike, without desire fruit.   That action prompted desire fruit, thought I', involves much dissipation energy called rajasa.   That action blindly undertaken without regard capacity consequences, involving loss hurt, called tamasa.   That doer called sattvika shed attachment, thought I', filled firmness zeal, recks neither success failure.   That doer said rajasa passionate, desirous fruit action, greedy, violent, unclean, moved joy sorrow.   That doer called tamasa undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, knavish, spiteful, indolent, woebegone, dilatory.   Hear now, O Dhananjaya, detailed fully severally, threefold division understanding will, according gunas.   That understanding, O Partha, sattvika knows action inaction, ought done ought not done, fear fearlessness bondage release.   That understanding, O Partha, rajasa, decides erroneously right wrong, ought done ought not done.   That understanding, O Partha, tamasa, which, shrouded darkness, thinks wrong right mistakes everything reverse.   That will, O Partha, sattvika maintains unbroken harmony activities mind, vital energies senses.   That will, O Partha, rajasa clings, attachment, righteousness, desire wealth, desirous fruit case.   That will, O Partha, tamasa, whereby insensate man not abandon sleep, fear, grief, despair self-conceit.   Hear Me, O Bharatarshabha, three kinds pleasure. Pleasure enjoyed repeated practice, puts end pain,   Which, inception, poison, end nectar, born serene realization true nature Atmanthat pleasure said sattvika.   That pleasure called rajasa which, arising contact senses objects, first nectar end like poison.   That pleasure called tamasa arising sleep sloth heedlessness, stupefies soul first end.   There no being, either earth heaven among gods, free three gunas born prakriti.   The duties Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Shudras, distributed according innate qualifications, O Parantapa.   Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness, uprightness, knowledge discriminative knowledge, faith God Brahmana's natural duties.   Valour, spiritedness, constancy, resourcefulness, not fleeing battle, generosity, capacity rule natural duties Kshatriya.   Tilling soil, protection cow commerce natural functions Vaishya, service natural duty Shudra.   Each man, complete absorption performance duty, wins perfection. Hear wins perfection devotion duty.   By offering worship duty Him moving spirit beings, pervaded, man wins perfection.   Better one's duty, though uninviting, another's may easily performed; duty accords one's nature, one incurs no sin. The central teaching Gita detachmentabandonment fruit action. And would no room abandonment one prefer another's duty one's own. Therefore one's duty said better another's. It spirit duty done matters, unattached performance reward.   One not abandon, O Kaunteya, duty one born, imperfect though be; action, inception, enveloped imperfection, fire smoke.   He weaned kinds, master himself, dead desire, attains renunciation perfection freedom action.   Learn Me, brief, O Kaunteya, gained perfection, attains Brahman, supreme consummation knowledge.   Equipped purified understanding, restraining self firm will, abandoning sound objects senses, putting aside likes dislikes,   Living solitude, spare diet, restrained speech, body mind, ever absorbed dhyanayoga, anchored dispassion,   Without pride, violence, arrogance, lust, wrath, possession, shed sense mine' peace himself, fit become one Brahman.   One Brahman peace himself, grieves not, desires; holding beings alike, achieves supreme devotion Me.   By devotion, realizes truth great I am, I am; known Me reality enters Me.   Even whilst always performing actions, makes Me refuge wins, My grace, eternal imperishable haven.   Casting, thy mind, actions Me, make Me thy goal, resorting yoga even-mindedness fix thy thought ever Me.   Fixing thy thought Me, thou shalt surmount obstacles My grace; possessed sense I' thou listen not, thou shalt perish.   If obsessed sense I', thou thinkest, I not fight', vain thy obsession; (thy) nature compel thee.   What thou wilt not do, O Kaunteya, thy delusion, thou shalt do, even thy will, bound thou art duty thou art born.   God, O Arjuna, dwells heart every His delusive mystery whirls all, (as though) set machine.   In Him alone seek thy refuge thy heart, O Bharata. By His grace shalt thou win eternal supreme peace.   Thus I expounded thee mysterious knowledge; ponder fully, act thou wilt.   Hear My supreme word, mysterious all; dearly beloved thou art Me, hence I desire declare thy welfare.   On Me fix thy mind, Me bring thy devotion, Me offer thy sacrifice, Me make thy obeisance; Me indeed shalt thou comesolemn My promise thee, thou art dear Me.   Abandon duties come Me refuge. I release thee sins; grieve not!   Utter never knows no austerity, no devotion, desire listen, yet scoffs Me.   He propound supreme mystery My devotees, shall, act highest devotion Me, surely come Me.   Nor among men renders dearer service Me he; earth beloved Me he. It gained knowledge lived life declare others. These two shlokas cannot possibly reference him, no matter conducts himself, give flawless reading interpretation Gita.   And man faith who, scorning not, listen it,even released go happy worlds men virtuous deeds.   Hast thou heard this, O Partha, concentrated mind? Has thy delusion, born ignorance, destroyed, O Dhananjaya? Arjuna Said:   Thanks Thy grace, O Achyuta, delusion destroyed, understanding returned. I stand secure, doubts dispelled; I thy bidding. Sanjaya Said:   Thus I hear marvellous thrilling discourse Vasudeva great-souled Partha.   It Vyasa's favor I listened supreme mysterious Yoga expounded lips Master Yoga, Krishna Himself.   O King, often I recall marvellous purifying discourse Keshava Arjuna, I filled recurring rapture.   And often I recall marvellous form Hari, wonder knows no bounds I rejoice again.   Wheresoever Krishna, Master Yoga, is, wheresoever Partha Bowman, rest assured Fortune, Victory, Prosperity, Eternal Right. \n"

Therefore capable turned gateway Freedom. It born sin becomes seed-bed sin. Hence also called field Kuru. The Kuravas represent forces Evil, Pandavas forces Good. Who not experienced daily conflict within forces Evil forces Good? Sanjaya Said:  On seeing Pandava\\'s army drawn battle array, King Duryodhana approached Drona, preceptor, addressed thus:  Behold, O preceptor, mighty army sons Pandu, set array son Drupada, thy wise disciple.  Here brave bowmen, peers Bhima Arjuna fighting: Yuyudhana Virata, Maharatha\\' Drupada.  Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, valorous Kashiraja, Purujit Kuntibhoja, Shaibya, chief among men;  Valiant Yudhamanyu, valorous Uttamaujas, Subhadra\\'s son, sons Draupadi--each one \\'Maharatha\\'.  Acquaint thyself now, O best Brahmanas, distinguished among us. I mention thy information, names captains army.  Thy noble self, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa, victorious battle, Ashvatthaman, Vikarna, also Somadatta\\'s son;  There many another hero, known skill wielding diverse weapons, pledged lay life sake, adepts war.   This force, commanded Bhishma, inadequate; theirs, commanded Bhima, quite adequate.   Therefore, let you, holding appointed places, every entrance, guard Bhishma.   At this, heroic grandsire, grand old man Kurus, gave loud lion\\'s roar blew conch hearten Duryodhana.   Thereupon, conches, drums, cymbals trumpets sounded once. Terrific noise.   Then Madhava Pandava, standing great chariot yoked white steeds, blew divine conches.   Hrishikesha blew Panchajanya Dhananjaya Devadatta; wolf-bellied Bhima dread deeds sounded great conch Paundra.   King Yudhishthira, Kunti\\'s son, blew Anantavijaya, Nakula nd Sahadeva conches, Sughosha Manipushpaka.   And Kashiraja, great bowman, Shikhandi Dhrishtadyumna, Virata Satyaki, unconquerable; \\'Maharatha\\',   Drupada, Draupadi\\'s sons, strong-armed son Subhadra, these, O King, blew conch.   That terrifying tumult, causing earth heaven resound, rent hearts Dhritarashtra\\'s sons.   -  Then, O King, ape-bannered Pandava, seeing Dhritarashtra\\'s sons arrayed flight arrows begin, took bow, spoke Hrishikesha: \"Set chariot two armies, O Achyuta!\"   That I may behold drawn up, battle intent, know I engage fearful combat;   And I may survey fighters assembled anxious fulfil battle perverse Duryodhana\\'s desire. Sanjaya Said:   -  Thus addressed Gudakesha, O King, Hrishikesha set unique chariot two armies front Bhishma, Drona kings said: Behold, O Partha, Kurus assembled yonder.   -  Then Partha see, standing there, sires, grandsires, preceptors, uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law friends armies. Beholding kinsmen ranged him, Kaunteya overcome great compassion spake anguish: Arjuna Said:   -  As I look upon kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled eager fight, limbs fail, mouth parched, tremor shakes frame hair stands end.   Gandiva slips hand, skin fire, I cannot keep feet, mind reels.   I unhappy forebodings, O Keshava; I see no good slaying kinsmen battle.   I seek not victory, sovereign power, earthly joys. What good sovereign power, worldly pleasures even life us, O Govinda?   Those would desire sovereign power, earthly joys delights arrayed battle, renounced life wealth-  Preceptors, sires, grandsires, sons even fathers-in-law, brothers-in-law, kinsmen. grandsons, uncles,   These I would not kill, O Madhusudana, even though slay me, not even kingship three worlds, much less earthly kingdom.   What pleasure slaying sons Dhritarashtra, O Janardana? Sin lot, slay these, usurpers though be.   It not therefore behove us kill kinsmen, sons Dhritarashtra. How may happy, O Madhava, killing kins?   Even though these, wits warped greed, see not guilt lies destroying family, sin treachery comrades;   How we, O Janardana, help recoiling sin, seeing clearly guilt lies destruction?   With destruction family perish eternal family virtues, perishing virtues unrighteousness seizes whole family.   When unrighteousness prevails, O Krishna, women family become corrupt, corruption, O Varshneya, causes confusion varnas.   This confusion verily drags family-slayer, well family, hell, want obsequial offerings rites departed sires fall blessedness.   By sins family-slayers resulting confusion varnas, eternal tribal family virtues brought naught.   For handed us, O Janardana, men whose family virtues ruined doomed dwell hell.   Alas! What heinous sin commit, that, greed joy sovereign power, prepared slay kith kin!   Happier far would Dhritarashtra\\'s sons, weapons hand, strike battlefield, unresisting unarmed. Sanjaya Said:   Thus spake Arjuna field battle, dropping bow arrows sank seat chariot, overwhelmed anguish. ']\n"

0," KRISHNA  The body is called a field, Arjuna; the one who knows it is called the Knower of the field. This is the knowledge of those who know. "
1," I am the Knower of the field in everyone, Arjuna. Knowledge of the field and its Knower is true knowledge. "
2,  Listen and I will explain the nature of the field and how change takes place within it. I will also describe the Knower of the field and his power. 
3," These truths have been sung by great sages in a variety of ways, and expounded in precise arguments concerning Brahman. "
4,"  The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy from which all these evolved. "
5," In this field arise desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the body, intelligence, and will. "
6,"  Those who know truly are free from pride and deceit. They are gentle, forgiving, upright, and pure, devoted to their spiritual teacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled. "
7," Detached from sense objects and self-will, they have learned the painful lesson of separate birth and suffering, old age, disease, and death. "
8,"  Free from selfish attachment, they do not get compulsively entangled even in home and family. They are even-minded through good fortune and bad. "
9," Their devotion to me is undivided. Enjoying solitude and not following the crowd, they seek only me. "
10,"  This is true knowledge, to seek the Self as the true end of wisdom always. To seek anything else is ignorance. "
11,"  I will tell you of the wisdom that leads to immortality: the beginningless Brahman, which can be called neither being nor nonbeing. "
12,"  It dwells in all, in every hand and foot and head, in every mouth and eye and ear in the universe. "
13," Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. "
14,"  It is both near and far, both within and without every creature; it moves and is unmoving. "
15," In its subtlety it is beyond comprehension. It is indivisible, yet appears divided in separate creatures. Know it to be the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. "
16,"  Dwelling in every heart, it is beyond darkness. It is called the light of light, the object and goal of knowledge, and knowledge itself. "
17,"  I have revealed to you the nature of the field and the meaning and object of true knowledge. Those who are devoted to me, knowing these things, are united with me. "
18,"  Know that prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning, and that from prakriti come the gunas and all that changes. "
19," Prakriti is the agent, cause, and effect of every action, but it is Purusha that seems to experience pleasure and pain. "
20,"  Purusha, resting in prakriti, witnesses the play of the gunas born of prakriti. But attachment to the gunas leads a person to be born for good or evil. "
21,"  Within the body the supreme Purusha is called the witness, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the supreme Lord, the highest Self. "
22,"  Whoever realizes the true nature of Purusha, prakriti, and the gunas, whatever path he or she may follow, is not born separate again. "
23,"  Some realize the Self within them through the practice of meditation, some by the path of wisdom, and others by selfless service. "
24," Others may not know these paths; but hearing and following the instructions of an illumined teacher, they too go beyond death. "
25,"  Whatever exists, Arjuna, animate or inanimate, is born through the union of the field and its Knower. "
26,"  They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. "
27," Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. "
28,"  They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved. "
29," When they see the variety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they attain fulfillment in Brahman. "
30,"  This supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is touched by action. "
31," As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every creature. "
32,"  As the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the source of all light in the field. "
33," Those who, with the eye of wisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to freedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal.   "

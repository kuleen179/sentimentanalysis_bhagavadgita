0,"  Tell me, O Sanjaya, what my sons and Pandu's assembled, on battle intent, did on the field of Kuru, the field of duty. Sanjaya Said:   "
1,"  On seeing the Arjuna's army drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana approached Drona, the preceptor, and addressed him thus:   "
2,"  Behold, O preceptor, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, set in array by the son of Drupada, your wise disciple.   "
3,"  Here are brave bowmen, peers of Bhima and Arjuna in fighting: Yuyudhana and Virata, and the â€˜Maharatha' Drupada.   "
4,"  Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, valorous Kashiraja, Purujit the Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya, chief among men;   "
5,"  Valiant Yudhamanyu, valorous Uttamaujas, Subhadra's son, and the sons of Draupadi--each one of them a 'Maharatha'.   "
6,"  Acquaint yourself now, O best of Brahmanas, with the distinguished among us. I mention for your information, the names of the captains of my army.   "
7,"  Your noble self, Bhishma, Karna, and Kripa, victorious in battle, Ashvatthaman, Vikarna, also Somadatta's son;   "
8,"  There is many another hero, known for his skill in wielding diverse weapons, pledged to lay down his life for my sake, and all adepts in war.   "
9,"  This our force, commanded by Bhishma, is all too inadequate; while theirs, commanded by Bhima, is quite adequate.   "
10,"  Therefore, let each of you, holding your appointed places, at every entrance, guard only Bhishma.   "
11,"  At this, the heroic grandsire, the grand old man of the Kurus, gave a loud lion's roar and blew his conch to hearten Duryodhana.   "
12,"  Thereupon, conches, drums, cymbals and trumpets were sounded all at once. Terrific was the noise.   "
13,"  Then Krishna and Arjuna, standing in their great chariot yoked with white steeds, blew their divine conches.   "
14,  Krishna blew the Panchajanya and Arjuna the Devadatta; while the wolf-bellied Bhima of dread deeds sounded his great conch Paundra.    
15,"  King Yudhishthira, Kunti's son, blew the Anantavijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva their conches, Sughosha and Manipushpaka.   "
16,"  And Kashiraja, the great bowman, Shikhandi Dhrishtadyumna, Virata and Satyaki, the unconquerable; the 'Maharatha',    "
17,"  Drupada, Draupadi's sons, the strong-armed son of Subhadra, all these, O King, blew each his own conch.   "
18,"  That terrifying tumult, causing earth and heaven to resound, rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's sons.   "
19,"  Then, O King, the ape-bannered Arjuna, seeing Dhritarashtra's sons arrayed and flight of arrows about to begin, took up his bow, and spoke thus to Krishna: ""Set my chariot between the two armies, O Krishna!""  "
20,"  Then, O King, the ape-bannered Arjuna, seeing Dhritarashtra's sons arrayed and flight of arrows about to begin, took up his bow, and spoke thus to Krishna: ""Set my chariot between the two armies, O Krishna!""   "
21,"  That I may behold them drawn up, on battle intent, and know whom I have to engage in this fearful combat;   "
22,  And that I may survey the fighters assembled here anxious to fulfil in battle perverse Duryodhana's desire. Sanjaya Said:   
23,"  Thus addressed by Arjuna, O King, Krishna set the unique  chariot between the two armies in front of Bhishma, Drona and all the kings  and said: Behold, O Arjuna, the Kurus assembled yonder.   "
24,"  Thus addressed by Arjuna, O King, Krishna set the unique  chariot between the two armies in front of Bhishma, Drona and all the kings  and said: Behold, O Arjuna, the Kurus assembled yonder.  "
25,"  Then did Arjuna see, standing there, sires, grandsires, preceptors, uncles,  brothers, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law and friends in both armies.  Beholding all these kinsmen ranged before him, Arjuna was overcome with  great compassion and spoke thus in anguish:  Arjuna Said:   "
26,"  Then did Arjuna see, standing there, sires, grandsires, preceptors, uncles,  brothers, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law and friends in both armies.  Beholding all these kinsmen ranged before him, Arjuna was overcome with  great compassion and spoke thus in anguish:  Arjuna Said:  "

28,"  As I look upon these kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled here eager to fight,  my limbs fail, my mouth is parched, a tremor shakes my frame and my hair  stands on end.  "
29,"  As I look upon these kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled here eager to fight,  my limbs fail, my mouth is parched, a tremor shakes my frame and my hair  stands on end.   "
30,"  Gandiva slips from my hand, my skin is on fire, I cannot keep my feet, and  my mind reels.   "
31,"  I have unhappy forebodings, O Krishna; and I see no good in slaying  kinsmen in battle.   "
32,"  I seek not victory, nor sovereign power, nor earthly joys. What good are  sovereign power, worldly pleasures and even life to us, O Krishna?      "
33,"  Those for whom we would desire sovereign power, earthly joys and  delights are here arrayed in battle, having renounced life and wealth- "
34,"  Preceptors, sires, grandsires, sons and even  fathers-in-law, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen.   grandsons,   uncles,    "
35,"  These I would not kill, O Krishna, even though they slay me, not even  for kingship of the three worlds, much less for an earthly kingdom.   "
36,"  What pleasure can there be in slaying these sons of Dhritarashtra, O  Krishna? Sin only can be our lot, if we slay these, usurpers though they be.   "
37,"  It does not therefore behove us to kill our kinsmen, these sons of  Dhritarashtra. How may we be happy, O Krishna, in killing our own kins?   "
38,"  Even though these, their wits warped by greed, see not the guilt that lies in  destroying the family, nor the sin of treachery to comrades;   "
39,"  How can we, O Krishna, help recoiling from this sin, seeing clearly as we  do the guilt that lies in such destruction?   "
40,"  With the destruction of the family perish the eternal family virtues, and with  the perishing of these virtues unrighteousness seizes the whole family.   "
41,"  When unrighteousness prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family  become corrupt, and their corruption, O Krishna, causes a confusion of  varnas.   "
42,"  This confusion verily drags the family-slayer, as well as the family, to hell,  and for want of obsequial offerings and rites their departed sires fall from  blessedness.   "
43,"  By the sins of these family-slayers resulting in confusion of varnas, the  eternal tribal and family virtues are brought to nothing.   "
44,"  For we have had it handed down to us, O Krishna, that the men whose  family virtues have been ruined are doomed to dwell in hell.   "
45,"  Alas! What a heinous sin we are about to commit, in that, from greed of the  joy of sovereign power, we are prepared to slay our kith and kin!   "
46,"  Happier far would it be for me if Dhritarashtra's sons, weapons in hand,  should strike me down on the battlefield, unresisting and unarmed.  Sanjaya Said:     "
47,"  Thus spoke Arjuna on the field of battle, and dropping his bow and arrows  sank down on his seat in the chariot, overwhelmed with anguish."

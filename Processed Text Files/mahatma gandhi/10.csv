0,"  Yet once more, O Arjuna, here My supreme word, which I will utter to  you, gratified one, for your benefit.   "
1,"  Neither the gods nor the great seers know My origin; for I am, every way, the  origin of them both.   "
2,"  He who knows Me, the great lord of the worlds, as birthless and without  beginning, he among mortals, undeluded, is released from sins.   "
3,"  Discernment, knowledge, freedom from delusion, long suffering, truth,  self-restraint, inward calm, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear and fearlessness;   "
4,"  Non-violence, even-mindedness, contentment, austerity, beneficence, good  and ill fame,—all these various attributes of creatures proceed verily from Me.   "
5,"  The seven great seers, the ancient four, and the Manus too were born of Me  and of My mind, and of them were born all the creatures in the world.   "
6,  He who knows in truth My immanence and My yoga becomes gifted with  unshakable yoga; of this there is no doubt.   
7,"  I am the source of all, all proceeds from me; knowing this, the wise worship  Me with hearts full of devotion.   "
8,"  With me in their thoughts, their whole soul devoted to Me, teaching one  another, with me ever on their lips, they live in contentment and joy.   "
9,"  To these, ever in tune with Me worshipping me with affectionate devotion, I  give the power of selfless action, whereby they come to Me.   "
10,"  Out of every compassion for them, I who dwell in their hearts, destroy the  darkness, born of ignorance, with the refulgent lamp of knowledge.  Arjuna Said:   "
11,"  Lord! You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme Abode, the supreme  Purifier! Everlasting Celestial Being, the Primal God, Unborn, All-pervading.   "
12,"  Thus have all the seers—the divine seer Narada, Asita, Devala,  Vyasa—declared You; and You Yourself do tell me so.   "
13,"  All that You tell me is true, I know, O Krishna, verily, Lord, neither the  gods nor the demons know Your manifestation.   "
14,"  Yourself alone You know by Yourself, O Krishna, O Source and  Lord of all beings, God of Gods, O Ruler of the universe.   "
15,"  Indeed You ought to tell me of all Your manifestations, without a  remainder, whereby You do pervade the worlds.   "
16,"  O Yogin! constantly meditating on You, how am I to know You? In what  various aspects am I to think of You, O Lord?    "
17,"  Recount to me yet again, in full detail, Your unique power and Your  immanence, O Krishna! For my ears cannot be sated with listening to Your  life-giving words.  The Lord Said:   "
18,"  Yea, I will unfold to you, O Arjuna, My divine manifestations,—the  chief only; for there is no limit to their extent.   "
19,"  I am the soul, O Arjuna, seated in the heart of every being; I am the  beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.   "
20,"  Of the Adityas I am Vishnu; of luminaries, the radiant Sun; of Maruts, I am  Marichi; of constellations, the moon.   "
21,  Of the Vedas I am the Sama Veda; of the gods Indra; of the senses I am the  mind; of beings I am the consciousness.   
22,  Of Rudras I am Shankara; of Yakshas and Rakshasas Kubera; of Vasus I am  the Fire; of mountains Meru.   
23,"  Of priests, O Arjuna, know Me to be the chief Brihaspati; of army captains I  am Kartikeya; and of waters the ocean.   "
24,"  Of the great seers I am Bhrigu; of words I am the one syllable ‘AUM'; of  sacrifices I am the Japa sacrifice; of things immovable, the Himalaya.   "
25,"  Of all trees I am Ashvattha; of the divine seers, Narada; of the heavenly  choir I am Chitraratha; of the perfected I am Kapila the ascetic.   "
26,"  Of horses, Know Me to be the Uchchaihshravas born with immortality; of mighty  elephants I am Airavata; of men, the monarch.   "
27,"  Of weapons, I am Vajra; of cows, Kamadhenu; I am Kandarpa, the god of  generation; of serpants I am Vasuki.   "
28,"  Of cobras I am Anata; of water-dwellers I am Varuna; of the manes I am  Aryaman; and of the chastisers, Yama.   "
29,"  Of demons I am Prahlada; of reckoners, the time; of beasts I am the lion; and  of birds, Garuda.   "
30,"  Of cleansing agents I am the Wind; of wielders of weapons, Rama; of fishes I  am the crocodile; of rivers the Ganges.   "
31,"  Of creations I am the beginning, end and middle, O Arjuna; of sciences, the  science of spiritual knowledge; of debators, the right argument.   "
32,"  Of letters, the letter A; of compounds I am the dvandva; I am the  imperishable Time; I am the creator to be seen everywhere.   "
33,"  All-seizing Death am I, as the source of things to be; in feminine virtues I am  Kirti (glory), Shri (beauty), Vak (speech), Smriti (memory), Medha  (intelligence), Dhriti (constancy) and Kshama (forgiveness).   "
34,"  Of Saman hymns I am Brihat Saman; of metres, Gayatri; of months I am  Margashirsha; of seasons, the spring.   "
35,"  Of deceivers I am the dice-play; of the splendid the splendour; I am victory,  I am resolution, I am the goodness of the good.   "
36,"  Of Vrishnis I am Krishna; of Pandavas Arjuna; of ascetics I am Vyasa;  and of seers, Ushanas.   "
37,"  I am the rod of those that punish; the strategy of those seeking victory; of  secret things I am silence, and the knowledge of those that know.   "
38,"  Whatever is the seed of every being, O Arjuna, that am I; there is nothing,  whether moving or fixed, that can be without Me.   "
39,  there is no end to my divine manifestations; what extent of them I have told  you now is only by way of illustration.   
40,"  Whatever is glorious, beautiful and mighty know you that all such has  issued from a fragment of My splendour.   "
41,"  But why need you to learn this at great length, O Arjuna? With but a  part of Myself I stand upholding this universe."

0,"  This body, O Arjuna, is called the Field; he who knows it is called the  knower of the Field by those who know.   "
1,"  And understand Me to be, O Arjuna, the knower of the Field in all the Fields;  and the knowledge of the Field and the knower of the Field, I hold, is true  knowledge.   "
2,"  What the Field is, what its nature, what its modifications, and where is  what, as also who He is, and what His power—hear this briefly from Me.   "
3,"  This subject has been sung by seers distinctively and in various ways, in  different hymns as also in aphoristic texts about Brahman well reasoned and  unequivocal.   "
4,"  The great elements, Individuation, Reason, the Unmanifest, the ten senses,  and the one (mind), and the five spheres of the senses;   "
5,"  Desire, dislike, pleasure, pain, association, consciousness, cohesion—this, in  sum, is what is called the Field with its modifications.   "
6,"  Freedom from pride and pretentiousness, nonviolence, forgiveness,  uprightness, service of the Master, purity, steadfastenes, self-restraint;   "
7,"  Aversion from sense-objects, absence of conceit, realization of the painfulness  and evil of birth, death, age and disease;   "
8,"  Absence of attachment, refusal to be wrapped up in one's children, wife,  home and family, even-mindedness whether good or ill befall;   "
9,"  Unwavering and all-exclusive devotion to Me, resort to secluded spots,  distaste for the haunts of men;   "
10,"  Settled conviction of the nature of the soul, perception of the goal of the  knowledge of Truth,—   "
11,"  I will (now) expound to you that which is to be known and knowing which  one enjoys immortality; it is the supreme Brahman which has no beginning,  which is called neither Being nor non-Being.   "
12,"  Everywhere having hands and feet, everywhere having eyes, heads,  mouths, everywhere having ears, It abides embracing everything in the  universe.   "
13,"  Seeming to possess the functions of the senses, It is devoid of all the senses;  It touches nothing, upholds all; having no gunas, It experiences the gunas.   "
14,"  Without all beings, yet within; immovable yet moving, so subtle that It  cannot be perceived; so far and yet so near It is.  "
15,"  Undivided, It seems to subsist divided in all beings; this Brahman— That which is to be known as the Sustainer of all, yet It is their Devourer and Creator.   "
16,"  Light of all lights, It is said to be beyond darkness; It is knowledge, the  object of knowledge, to be gained only by knowledge; It is seated in the hearts  of all.   "
17,"  Thus have I expounded in brief the Field, Knowledge and That which is to  be known; My devotee, when he knows this, is worthy to become one with Me.   "
18,  Know that Prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning; know that all  the modifications and gunas are born of Prakriti.   
19,  Prakriti is described as the cause in the creation of effects from causes;  Purusha is described as the cause of the experiencing of pleasure and pain.   
20,"  For the Purusha, residing in Prakriti, experiences the gunas born in Prakriti;  attachment to these gunas is the cause of his birth in good or evil wombs.   "
21,"  What is called in this body the Witness, the Assentor, the Sustainer, the  Experiencer, the Great Lord and also the Supreme soul, is Supreme Being.   "
22,"  He who thus knows Purusha and Prakriti with its gunas, is not born again,  no matter how he live and move.   "
23,"  Some through meditation hold the soul by themselves in their own self;  others by Sankhya Yoga, and others by Karma Yoga.   "
24,"  Yet others, not knowing (Him) thus, worship (Him) having heard from  others; they too pass beyond death, because of devoted adherence to what they  have heard.   "
25,"  Wherever something is born, animate or inanimate, know you  Arjuna, that it issues from the union of the Field and the Knower of the  Field.     "
26,"  Who sees abiding in all beings the same Supreme lord, imperishable in the  perishable, he sees indeed.   "
27,"  When he sees the same Supreme Being abiding everywhere alike, he does not hurt  himself by himself and hence he attains the highest goal.   "
28,"  Who sees that it is Prakriti that performs all actions and thus (knows) that  soul performs them not, he sees indeed.   "
29,"  When he sees the diversity of beings as founded in unity and the whole  expanse issuing therefrom, then he attains to Brahman.   "
30,"  This imperishable Supreme soul, O Arjuna, though residing in the  body, acts not and is not stained, for he has no beginning and no gunas.   "
31,"  As the all-pervading ether, by reason of its subtlety, is not soiled even so  soul pervading every part of the body is not soiled.   "
32,"  As the one Sun illumines the whole universe, even so the Master of the Field  illumines the whole field, O Arjuna!   "
33,"  Those who, with the eyes of knowledge, thus perceive the distinction  between the Field and the Knower of the Field, and (the secret) of the release o  beings from Prakriti, they attain to the Supreme."

0,"  Yet again I will expound the highest and the best of all knowledge, knowing  which all the sages passed hence to the highest perfection.   "
1,"  By having recourse to this knowledge they became one with Me. They need  not come to birth even at a creation, nor do they suffer at a dissolution.   "
2,"  The great prakriti is for me the womb in which I deposit the germ; from it all  beings come to birth, O Arjuna.   "
3,"  Whatever forms take birth in the various species, the great prakriti is their  Mother and I the seed-giving Father.   "
4,"  Sattva, rajas and tamas are the gunas sprung from prakriti; it is they, O  Arjuna, that keep the imperishable Dweller bound to the body.   "
5,"  Of these sattva, being stainless, is light-giving and healing; it binds with the  bond of happiness and the bond of knowledge, O sinless one.   "
6,"  Rajas, know you, is of the nature of passion, the source of thirst and  attachment; it keeps man bound with the bond of action.   "
7,"  Tamas, know you, born of ignorance, is mortal man's delusion; it keeps him  bound with heedlessness, sloth and slumber, O Arjuna.   "
8,"  Sattva attaches man to happiness, rajas to action, and tamas, shrouding  knowledge, attaches him to heedlessness.   "
9,"  Sattva prevails, O Arjuna, having overcome rajas and tamas; rajas, when it  has overpowered sattva and tamas; likewise tamas reigns when sattva and rajas  are crushed.   "
10,"  When the light—knowledge—shines forth from al the gates of this body,  then it may be known that the sattva thrives.   "
11,"  Greed, activity, assumption of undertakings, restlessness, craving—these are  in evidence when rajas flourishes, O Arjuna.   "
12,"  Ignorance, dullness, heedlessness, and delusion—these are in evidence  when tamas reigns, O Arjuna.   "
13,"  If the embodied one meets his end whilst sattva prevails, then he attains to  the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest.    "
14,"  If he dies during the reign within him of rajas, he is born among men  attached to action; and if he dies in tamas, he is born in species not endowed  with reason.   "
15,  The fruit of sattvika action is said to be stainless merit. That of rajas is pain  and that of tamas ignorance.   
16,"  Those abiding in sattva rise upwards, those in rajas stay midway, those in  tamas sink downwards.   "
17,"  when the seer perceives no agent other than the gunas, and knows Him who  is above the gunas, he attains to My being.   "
18,"  When the embodied one transcends these three gunas which are born of his  contact with the body, he is released from the pain of birth, death and age and  attains deathlessness.  Arjuna Said:   "
19,"  What, O Lord, are the marks of him who has transcended the three gunas?  How does he conduct himself? How does he transcend the three gunas?  The Lord Said:   "
20,"  He, O Arjuna, who does not disdain light, activity, and delusion when  they come into being, nor desires them when they vanish;   "
21,"  He, who seated as one indifferent, is not shaken by the gunas, and stays still  and moves not, knowing it is gunas playing their parts;   "
22,"  He who holds pleasure and pain alike, who is sedate, who regards as same  earth, stone and gold, who is wise and weighs in equal scale things pleasant  and unpleasant, who is even-minded in praise and blame;   "
23,"  Who holds alike respect and disrespect, who is the same to friend and foe,  who indulges in no undertakings—That man is called gunatita.   "
24,  He who serves me in an unwavering and exclusive bhaktiyoga transcends  these gunas and is worthy to become one with Brahman.   
25,"  For I am the very image of Brahman, changeless and deathless, as also of  everlasting dharma and perfect bliss."

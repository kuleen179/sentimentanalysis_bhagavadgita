0,"  Fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in jnana and yoga—knowledge  and action, beneficence, self-restraint, sacrifice, spiritual study, austerity, and  uprightness;   "
1,"  Non-violence, truth, slowness to wrath, the spirit of dedication, serenity,  aversion to slander, tenderness to all that lives, freedom from greed, gentleness,  modesty, freedom from levity;   "
2,"  Spiritedness, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom from ill-will and  arrogance—these are to be found in one born with the divine heritage, O  Arjuna.   "
3,"  Pretentiousness, arrogance, self-conceit, wrath, coarseness, ignorance—these  are to be found in one born with the devilish heritage.   "
4,"  The divine heritage makes for Freedom, the devilish for bondage. Grieve not,  O Arjuna; you are born with a divine heritage.   "
5,"  There are two orders of created beings in this world—the divine and the  devilish; the divine order has been described in detail, hear from Me now of the  devilish, O Arjuna.   "
6,"  Men of the devil do not know what they may do and what they may not do;  neither is there any purity, nor right conduct, nor truth to be found in them.   "
7,"  ‘Without truth, without basis, without God is the universe,' they say; ‘born of  the union of the sexes, prompted by nothing but lust.'   "
8,"  Holding this view, these depraved souls, of feeble understanding and of  fierce deeds, come forth as enemies of the world to destroy it.     "
9,"  Given to insatiable lust, possessed by pretentiousness, arrogance and  conceit, they seize wicked purposes in their delusion, and go about pledged to  uncleaned deeds.   "
10,"  Given to boundless cares that end only with their death, making indulgence  or lust their sole goal, convinced that that is all;   "
11,"  Caught in a myriad snares of hope, slaves to lust and wrath, they speak  unlawfully to amass wealth for the satisfaction of their appetites.   "
12,  ‘This have I gained today; this aspiration shall I now attain; this wealth is  mine; this likewise shall be mine hereafter;   
13,"  ‘This enemy I have already slain, others also I shall slay; lord of all am I;  enjoyment is mine, perfection is mine, strength is mine, happiness is mine;   "
14,"  ‘Wealthy am I, and high-born. What other is like unto me? I shall perform a  sacrifice! I shall give alms! I shall be merry!' Thus think they, by ignorance  deluded;   "
15,"  And tossed about by diverse fancies, caught in the net of delusion, stuck  deep in the indulgence of appetites, into foul hell they fall.   "
16,"  Wise in their own conceit, stubborn, full of the intoxication of pelf and pride,  they offer nominal sacrifices for show, contrary to the rule.   "
17,"  Given to pride, force, arrogance, lust and wrath they are deriders indeed,  scorning Me in their own and other' bodies.   "
18,"  These cruel scorners, lowest of mankind and vile, I hurl down again and  again, into devilish wombs.   "
19,"  Doomed to devilish wombs, these deluded ones, far from ever coming to  Me, sink lower and lower in birth after birth.   "
20,"  Three-fold is the gate of hell, leading man to perdition—Lust, Wrath, and  Greed; these three, therefore, should be shunned.   "
21,"  The man who escapes these three gates of Darkness, O Arjuna, works out  his welfare and from there reaches the highest state.   "
22,"  He who forsakes the rule of shastra and does but the bidding of his selfish  desires, gains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the highest state.  Shastra does not mean the rites and formulae laid down in the so-called  dharmashastra, but the path of self-restraint laid down by the seers and the  saints.    "
23,  Therefore let shastra be your authority for determining what ought to be  done and what ought not to be done; ascertain you the rule of the shastra and  do your task here (accordingly).

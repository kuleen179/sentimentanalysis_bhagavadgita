0,"  If, O Krishna, you hold that the attitude of detachment is superior to  action, then why, O Krishna, do you urge me to dreadful action?    "
1,"  You do seem to confuse my understanding with perplexing speech; tell  me, therefore, in no uncertain voice, that alone whereby I may attain salvation.   The Lord Said:   "
2,"  I have spoken, before, O sinless one, of two attitudes in this world—the  Sankhayas', that of Jnana yoga and the Yogins', that of karma yoga.   "
3,"  Never does man enjoy freedom from action by not undertaking action, nor  does he attain that freedom by mere renunciation of action.   "
4,  For none ever remains inactive even for a moment; for all are compelled to  action by the gunas inherent in prakriti.   
5,"  He who curbs the organs of action but allows the mind to dwell on the  sense-objects,—such a one, wholly deluded, is called a hypocrite.   "
6,"  But he, O Arjuna, who keeping all the senses under control of the mind,  engages the organs in Karma yoga, without attachment—that man excels.   "
7,  Do you your allotted task; for action is superior to inaction; with inaction even  life's normal course is not possible.   
8,"  This world of men suffers bondage from all action save that which is done for  the sake of sacrifice; to this end, O Arjuna, perform action without  attachment.   "
9,"  Together with sacrifice did the Lord of beings create, of old, mankind,  declaring:  ""By this shall you increase; may this be to you the giver of all your desires.   "
10,"  ""With this may you cherish the gods and may the gods cherish you; thus  cherishing one another may you attain the highest good.   "
11,"  ""Cherished with sacrifice, the gods will bestow on you the desired boons.""  He who enjoys their gifts without rendering aught unto them is verily a thief.   "
12,"  The righteous men who eat the residue of the sacrifice are freed from all sin,  but the wicked who cook for themselves eat sin.   "
13,"  From food springs all life, from rain is born food; from sacrifice comes rain  and sacrifice is the result of action.   "
14,  Know that action springs from Brahman and Brahman from the  Imperishable; hence the all-pervading Brahman is ever firm-founded on  sacrifice.   
15,"  He who does not follow the wheel thus set in motion here below, he, living  in sin, sating his senses, lives, O Arjuna, in vain.   "
16,"  But the man who revels in soul, who is content in soul and who is  satisfied only with soul, for him no action exists.   "
17,"  He has no interest whatever in anything done, nor in anything not done, nor  has he need to rely on anything for personal ends.    "
18,"  Therefore, do you ever perform without attachment the work that you  must do; for performing action without attachment man attains the Supreme.   "
19,  For through action alone Janaka and others achieved perfection; even with a  view to the guidance of mankind you must act.   
20,"  Whatever the best man does, is also done by other men, what example he  sets, the world follows.   "
21,"  For me, O Arjuna, there is nothing to do in the three worlds, nothing worth  gaining that I have not gained; yet I am ever in action.   "
22,"  Indeed, for were I not, unslumbering, ever to remain in action, O Arjuna,  men would follow my example in every way.   "
23,"  If I were not to perform my task, these worlds would be ruined; I should be  the same cause of chaos and of the end of all mankind.   "
24,"  Just as, with attachment, the unenlightened perform all actions, O Arjuna,  even so, but unattached, should the enlightened man act, with a desire for the  welfare of humanity.   "
25,"  The enlightened may not confuse the mind of the unenlightened, who are  attached to action; rather must he perform all actions unattached, and thus  encourage them to do likewise.   "
26,"  All action is entirely done by the gunas of prakriti. Man, deluded by the  sense of ‘I', thinks, ‘I am the doer'.    "
27,"  But he, O Arjuna, who understands the truth of the various gunas and  their various activities, knows that it is the gunas that operate on the gunas; he  does not claim to be the doer.   "
28,  Deluded by the gunas of prakriti men become attached to the activities of  the gunas; he who knows the truth of things should not unhinge the  slow-witted who have not the knowledge.   
29,"  Cast all your acts on Me, with your mind fixed on the indwelling soul, and  without any thought of fruit, or sense of ‘mine' shake off your fever and fight!   "
30,"  Those who always act according to the rule I have here laid down, in faith  and without cavilling—they too are released from the bondage of their actions.   "
31,"  But those who cavil at the rule and refuse to conform to it are fools, dead to  all knowledge; know that they are lost.   "
32,  Even a man of knowledge acts according to his nature; all creatures follow  their nature; what then will constraint avail?   
33,"  Each sense has its settled likes and dislikes towards its objects; man should  not come under the sway of these, for they are his besetters.   "
34,"  Better one's own duty, bereft of merit, than another's well-performed; better  is death in the discharge of one's duty; another's duty is fraught with danger.   Arjuna Said:   "
35,"  Then what impels man to sin, O Krishna, even against his will, as though  by force compelled?  The Lord Said:   "
36,"  It is Lust, it is Wrath, born of the guna—Rajas. It is the arch-devourer, the  arch-sinner. Know this to be man's enemy here.   "
37,"  As fire is obscured by smoke, a mirror by dirt, and the embryo by the  amnion, so is knowledge obscured by this.   "
38,"  Knowledge is obscured, O Arjuna, by this eternal enemy of the wise man,  in the form of Lust, the insatiable fire.   "
39,"  The senses, the mind and the reason are said to be its great seat; by means of  these it obscures knowledge and stupefies man.    "
40,"  Therefore, O Arjuna, bridle you first the senses and then rid yourself  of this sinner, the destroyer of knowledge and discrimination.   "
41,"  Subtle, they say, are the senses; subtler than the senses is the mind; subtler  than the mind is the reason; but subtler even than the reason is He.     "
42,"  Thus realizing Him to be subtler than the reason, and controlling the self by  the Self (Atman), destroy, O Arjuna, this enemy—Lust, so hard to  overcome. "

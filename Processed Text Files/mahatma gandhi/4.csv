0,"  I expounded this imperishable yoga to Vivasvat; Vivasvat communicated it to  Manu, and Manu to Ikshvaku.   "
1,"  Thus handed down in succession, the royal sages learnt it; with long lapse of  time it dwindled away in this world, O Arjuna.   "
2,"  The same ancient yoga have I expounded to you today; for you are My  devotee and My friend, and this is the supreme mystery.  Arjuna Said:   "
3,"  Later was Your birth, my Lord, earlier that of Vivasvat. How then am I to  understand that You didst expound it in the beginning?  The Lord Said:   "
4,"  Many births have we passed through, O Arjuna, both you and I; I know  them all, you know them not, O Arjuna.  Though unborn and inexhaustible in My essence, though Lord of all beings, yet  assuming control over My Nature, I come into being by My mysterious power.   "
5,"  For whenever Right declines and Wrong prevails, then O Arjuna, I come to  birth.     "
6,"  To save the righteous, to destroy the wicked, and to re-establish Right I am  born from age to age.    "
7,"  He who knows the secret of this My divine birth and action is not born again,  after leaving the body; he comes to Me, O Arjuna.    "
8,"  Freed from passion, fear and wrath, filled full with Me, relying on Me, and  refined by the fiery ordeal of knowledge, many have become one with Me.   "
9,"  In whatever way men resort to Me, even so do I render to them. In every  way, O Arjuna, the path men follow is Mine.    "
10,  Those who desire their actions to bear fruit worship the gods here; for in this  world of men the fruit of action is quickly obtainable.    
11,"  The order of the four varnas was created by Me according to the different  gunas and karma of each; yet know that though, therefore, author thereof,  being changeless I am not the author.   "
12,"  Actions do not affect Me, nor am I concerned with the fruits thereof. He who  recognizes Me as such is not bound by actions.    "
13,"  Knowing this did men of old, desirous of freedom, perform action; do you,  then, just as they did—the men of old in days gone by.   "
14,  ‘What is action? What is inaction?'—here even the wise are perplexed. I will  then expound to you that action knowing which you shall be saved from evil.   
15,"  For it is meet to know the meaning of action, of forbidden action, as also  inaction. Impenetrable is the secret of action.   "
16,"  Who sees action in action and action in inaction, he is enlightened among  men, he is a yogi, he has done all he need do.    "
17,"  He whose every undertaking is free from desire and selfish purpose, and he  who has burnt all his actions in the fire of knowledge—such an one the wise call  a pandita.   "
18,"  He who has renounced attachment to the fruit of action, who is ever content,  and free from all dependence,—he, though immersed in action, yet acts not.   "
19,"  Expecting nothing, holding his mind and body in check, putting away every  possession, and going through action only in the body he incurs no stain.   "
20,"  Content with whatever chance may bring, rid of the pairs of opposites, free  from ill-will, even-minded in success and failure, he is not bound though he  acts.   "
21,"  Of the free soul who has shred all attachment, whose mind is firmly  grounded in knowledge, who acts only for sacrifice, all karma is extinguished.   "
22,  The offering of sacrifice is Brahman; the oblation is Brahman; it is offered by  Brahman in the fire that is Brahman; thus he whose mind is fixed on acts  dedicated to Brahman must needs pass on to Brahman.   
23,"  Some yogins perform sacrifice in the form of worship of the gods, others  offer sacrifice of sacrifice itself in the fire that is Brahman.   "
24,  Some offer as sacrifice the sense of hearing and the other senses in the fires  of restraint; others sacrifice sound and the other objects of sense in the fires of  the senses.   
25,  Others again sacrifice all the activities of the senses and of the vital energy in  the yogic fire of self-control kindled by knowledge.   
26,  Some sacrifice with material gifts; with austerities; with yoga; some with the  acquiring and some with the imparting of knowledge. All these are sacrifices of  stern vows and serious endeavour.   
27,"  Others absorbed in the practices of the control of the vital energy sacrifice  the outward in the inward and the inward in the outward, or check the flow of  both the inward and the outward vital airs.   "
28,"  Yet others, abstemious in food, sacrifice one form of vital energy in another.  All these know what sacrifice is and purge themselves of all impurities by  sacrifice.   "
29,"  Those who partake of the residue of sacrifice—called amrita  (ambrosia)—attain to everlasting Brahman. Even this world is not for a  non-sacrificer; how then the next, O Arjuna?   "
30,  Even so various sacrifices have been described in the Vedas; know them all  to proceed from action; knowing this you shall be released.   
31,"  Knowledge-sacrifice is better, O-Parantapa, than material sacrifice, for all  action which does not bind finds its consummation in Knowledge (jnana).   "
32,  The masters of knowledge who have seen the Truth will impart to you this  Knowledge; learn it through humble homage and service and by repeated  questioning.   
33,"  When you have gained this knowledge, O Arjuna, you shall not again fall  into such error; by virtue of it you shall see all beings without exception in  yourself and thus in Me.   "
34,"  Even though you be the most sinful of sinners, you shall cross the ocean of  sin by the boat of knowledge.   "
35,"  As a blazing fire turns its fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, even so the fire of  Knowledge turns all actions to ashes.   "
36,  There is nothing in this world so purifying as Knowledge. He who is  perfected by yoga finds it in himself in the fullness of time.   
37,"  It is the man of faith who gains knowledge—the man who is intent on it and  who has mastery over his senses; having gained knowledge, he comes before long  to the supreme peace.   "
38,"  But the man of doubt, without knowledge and without faith, is lost; for him  who is given to doubt there is neither this world nor that beyond, nor  happiness.   "
39,"  He who has renounced all action by means of yoga, who has severed all  doubt by means of knowledge—him self-possessed, no actions bind, O  Arjuna!   "
40,"  Therefore, with the sword of Self-realization sever you this doubt, bred of  ignorance, which has crept into your heart! Betake yourself to yoga and arise, O  Arjuna! "

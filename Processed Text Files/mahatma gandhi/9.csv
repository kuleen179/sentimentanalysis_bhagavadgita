0,"  I will now declare to you, who are uncensorious, this mysterious knowledge,  together with discriminative knowledge, knowing which you shall be released  from ill.   "
1,"  This is the king of sciences, the king of mysteries, pure and sovereign, capable  of direct comprehension, the essence of dharma, easy to practice, changeless.   "
2,"  Men who have no faith in this doctrine, O Arjuna, far from coming to Me,  return repeatedly to the path of this world of death.   "
3,"  By Me, unmanifest in form, this whole world is pervaded; all beings are in  Me, I am not in them.   "
4,"  And yet those beings are not in Me. That indeed is My unique power as Lord!  Sustainer of all beings, I am not in them; My Self brings them into existence.   "
5,"  As the mighty wind, moving everywhere, is ever contained in ether, even so  know that all beings are contained in Me.   "
6,"  All beings, O Arjuna, merge into my prakriti, at the end of a kalpa, and I  send them forth again when a kalpa begins.   "
7,"  Resorting to my prakriti, I send forth again and again this multitude of  beings, powerless under the sway of prakriti.   "
8,"  But all this activity, O Arjuna, does not bind Me, seated as one  indifferent, unattached to it.   "
9,"  With me as Presiding Witness, prakriti gives birth to all that moves and does  not move; and because of this, O Arjuna, the wheel of the world keeps going.   "
10,"  Not knowing My transcendent nature as the sovereign Lord of all beings,  fools condemn Me incarnated as man.   "
11,"  Vain are the hopes, actions and knowledge of those witless ones who have  resorted to the delusive nature of monsters and devils.   "
12,"  But those great souls who resort to the divine nature, O Arjuna, know Me as  the Imperishable Source of all beings and worship Me with an undivided mind.   "
13,"  Always declaring My glory, striving in steadfast faith, they do Me devout  homage; ever attached to Me, they worship Me.   "
14,"  Yet others, with knowledge-sacrifice, worship Me, who am to be seen  everywhere, as one, as different or as many.   "
15,  I am the sacrificial vow; I am the sacrifice; I the ancestral oblation; I the herb;  I the sacred text; I the clarified butter; I the fire; I the burnt offering.   
16,"  Of this universe I am the Father, Mother, Creator, Grandsire: I am what is to  be known, the sacred syllable AUM; the Rig, the Saman and the Yajus;     "
17,"  I am the Goal, the Sustainer, the Lord, the Witness, the Abode, the Refuge,  the Friend; the Origin, the End the Preservation, the Treasure house, the  Imperishable Seed.   "
18,"  I give heat; I hold back and pour forth rain; I am deathlessness and also  death. O Arjuna, Being and not-Being as well.   "
19,"  Followers of the three Vedas, who drink the soma juice and are purged of  sin, worship Me with sacrifice and pray for going to heaven; they reach the holy  world of the gods and enjoy in heaven the divine joys of the gods.   "
20,"  They enjoy the vast world of heaven, and their merit spent, they enter the  world of the mortals; thus those who, following the Vedic law, long for the fruit  of their action earn but the round of birth and death.   "
21,"  As for those who worship Me, thinking on Me alone and nothing else, ever  attached to Me, I bear the burden of getting them what they need.   "
22,"  Even those who, devoted to other gods, worship them in full faith, even  they, O Arjuna, worship none but Me, though not according to the rule.   "
23,"  For I am the Acceptor and the Director of all sacrifices; but not recognizing  Me as I am, they go astray.   "
24,  Those who worship the gods go to the gods; those who worship the manes  go to the manes; those who worship the spirits go to the spirits; but those who  worship Me come to Me.   
25,"  Any offering of leaf, flower, fruit or water, made to Me in devotion, by an  earnest soul, I lovingly accept.   "
26,"  Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as  sacrifice or gift, whatever austerity you do perform, O Arjuna, dedicate all  to Me.   "
27,"  So doing you shall be released from the bondage of action, yielding good  and evil fruit; having accomplished both renunciation and performance, you  shall be released (from birth and death) and come unto Me.   "
28,"  I am the same to all beings; with Me there is non disfavoured, none  favoured; but those who worship Me with devotion are in Me and I in them.   "
29,"  A sinner, howsoever great, if he turns to Me with undivided devotion, must  indeed be counted a saint; for he has a settled resolve.   "
30,"  For soon he becomes righteous and wins everlasting peace; know for a  certainty, O Arjuna, that my bhakta never perishes.   "
31,"  For finding refuge in Me, even those who though are born of the womb of  sin, women, vaishyas, and shudras too, reach the supreme goal.   "
32,"  How much more then, the pure brahmanas and seer-kings who are my  devotees? Do you worship Me, therefore, since you have come to this fleeting  and joyless world.   "
33,"  On Me fix your mind, to Me bring your devotion, to Me offer your sacrifice, to  Me make your obeisance; thus having attached yourself to Me and made Me your  end and aim, to Me indeed shall you come."

 O Krishna, you have said that knowledge is greater than action; why then do you ask me to wage this terrible war? \",\"Your advice seems inconsistent. Give me one path to follow to the supreme good. \",\"KRISHNA:  At the beginning of time I declared two paths for the pure heart: jnana yoga, the contemplative path of spiritual wisdom, and karma yoga, the active path of selfless service. \",\"One who shirks action does not attain freedom; no one can gain perfection by abstaining from work. \",\"Indeed, there is no one who rests for even an instant; all creatures are driven to action by their own nature. \",\"Those who abstain from action while allowing the mind to dwell on sensual pleasure cannot be called sincere spiritual aspirants. \",\"But they excel who control their senses through the mind, using them for selfless service. \",\"Fulfill all your duties; action is better than inaction. Even to maintain your body, Arjuna, you are obliged to act. \",\"Selfish action imprisons the world. Act selflessly, without any thought of personal profit. \",\"At the beginning, mankind and the obligation of selfless service were created together. Through selfless service, you will always be fruitful and find the fulfillment of your desires: this is the promise of the Creator. \",\"Honor and cherish the devas as they honor and cherish you; through this honor and love you will attain the supreme good. \",\"All human desires are fulfilled by the devas, who are pleased by selfless service. But anyone who enjoys the things given by the devas without offering selfless acts in return is a thief. \",\"The spiritually minded, who eat in the spirit of service, are freed from all their sins; but the selfish, who prepare food for their own satisfaction, eat sin. \",\"Living creatures are nourished by food, and food is nourished by rain; rain itself is the water of life, which comes from selfless worship and service. \",\"Every selfless act, Arjuna, is born from Brahman, the eternal, infinite Godhead. Brahman is present in every act of service. \",\"All life turns on this law, O Arjuna. Those who violate it, indulging the senses for their own pleasure and ignoring the needs of others, have wasted their life. \",\"But those who realize the Self are always satisfied. Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no longer seek happiness from the external world. \",\"They have nothing to gain or lose by any action; neither people nor things can affect their security. \",\"Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. \",\"Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path. \",\"What the outstanding person does, others will try to do. The standards such people create will be followed by the whole world. \",\"There is nothing in the three worlds for me to gain, Arjuna, nor is there anything I do not have; I continue to act, but I am not driven by any need of my own. \",\"If I ever refrained from continuous work, everyone would immediately follow my example. \",\"If I stopped working I would be the cause of cosmic chaos, and finally of the destruction of this world and these people. \",\"The ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare of the world, without thought for themselves. \",\"By abstaining from work you will confuse the ignorant, who are engrossed in their actions. Perform all work carefully, guided by compassion. \",\"All actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti. Deluded by identification with the ego, a person thinks, I am the doer. \",\"But the illumined man or woman understands the domain of the gunas and is not attached. Such people know that the gunas interact with each other; they do not claim to be the doer. \",\"Those who are deluded by the operation of the gunas become attached to the results of their action. Those who understand these truths should not unsettle the ignorant. \",\"Performing all actions for my sake, completely absorbed in the Self, and without expectations, fight!  but stay free from the fever of the ego. \",\"Those who live in accordance with these divine laws without complaining, firmly established in faith, are released from karma. \",\"Those who violate these laws, criticizing and complaining, are utterly deluded, and are the cause of their own suffering. \",\"Even the wise act within the limitations of their own nature. Every creature is subject to prakriti; what is the use of repression? \",\"The senses have been conditioned by attraction to the pleasant and aversion to the unpleasant. Do not be ruled by them; they are obstacles in your path. \",\"It is better to strive in ones own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following ones own dharma, but competition in anothers dharma breeds fear and insecurity. \",\"ARJUNA:  What is the force that binds us to selfish deeds, O Krishna? What power moves us, even against our will, as if forcing us? \",\"KRISHNA: It is selfish desire and anger, arising from the guna of rajas; these are the appetites and evils which threaten a person in this life. \",\"Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, just as the embryo rests deep within the womb, knowledge is hidden by selfish desire  \",\"hidden, Arjuna, by this unquenchable fire for self-satisfaction, the inveterate enemy of the wise. \",\"Selfish desire is found in the senses, mind, and intellect, misleading them and burying the understanding in delusion. \",\"Fight with all your strength, Arjuna! Controlling your senses, conquer your enemy, the destroyer of knowledge and realization. \",\"The senses are higher than the body, the mind higher than the senses; above the mind is the intellect, and above the intellect is the Atman. \",\"Thus, knowing that which is supreme, let the Atman rule the ego. Use your mighty arms to slay the fierce enemy that is selfish desire.\",\"  If, O Krishna, you hold that the attitude of detachment is superior to  action, then why, O Krishna, do you urge me to dreadful action?    \",\"  You do seem to confuse my understanding with perplexing speech; tell  me, therefore, in no uncertain voice, that alone whereby I may attain salvation.   The Lord Said:   \",\"  I have spoken, before, O sinless one, of two attitudes in this world\\u2014the  Sankhayas', that of Jnana yoga and the Yogins', that of karma yoga.   \",\"  Never does man enjoy freedom from action by not undertaking action, nor  does he attain that freedom by mere renunciation of action.   \",\"  For none ever remains inactive even for a moment; for all are compelled to  action by the gunas inherent in prakriti.   \",\"  He who curbs the organs of action but allows the mind to dwell on the  sense-objects,\\u2014such a one, wholly deluded, is called a hypocrite.   \",\"  But he, O Arjuna, who keeping all the senses under control of the mind,  engages the organs in Karma yoga, without attachment\\u2014that man excels.   \",\"  Do you your allotted task; for action is superior to inaction; with inaction even  life's normal course is not possible.   \",\"  This world of men suffers bondage from all action save that which is done for  the sake of sacrifice; to this end, O Arjuna, perform action without  attachment.   \",\"  Together with sacrifice did the Lord of beings create, of old, mankind,  declaring:  \\\"By this shall you increase; may this be to you the giver of all your desires.   \",\"  \\\"With this may you cherish the gods and may the gods cherish you; thus  cherishing one another may you attain the highest good.   \",\"  \\\"Cherished with sacrifice, the gods will bestow on you the desired boons.\\\"  He who enjoys their gifts without rendering aught unto them is verily a thief.   \",\"  The righteous men who eat the residue of the sacrifice are freed from all sin,  but the wicked who cook for themselves eat sin.   \",\"  From food springs all life, from rain is born food; from sacrifice comes rain  and sacrifice is the result of action.   \",\"  Know that action springs from Brahman and Brahman from the  Imperishable; hence the all-pervading Brahman is ever firm-founded on  sacrifice.   \",\"  He who does not follow the wheel thus set in motion here below, he, living  in sin, sating his senses, lives, O Arjuna, in vain.   \",\"  But the man who revels in soul, who is content in soul and who is  satisfied only with soul, for him no action exists.   \",\"  He has no interest whatever in anything done, nor in anything not done, nor  has he need to rely on anything for personal ends.    \",\"  Therefore, do you ever perform without attachment the work that you  must do; for performing action without attachment man attains the Supreme.   \",\"  For through action alone Janaka and others achieved perfection; even with a  view to the guidance of mankind you must act.   \",\"  Whatever the best man does, is also done by other men, what example he  sets, the world follows.   \",\"  For me, O Arjuna, there is nothing to do in the three worlds, nothing worth  gaining that I have not gained; yet I am ever in action.   \",\"  Indeed, for were I not, unslumbering, ever to remain in action, O Arjuna,  men would follow my example in every way.   \",\"  If I were not to perform my task, these worlds would be ruined; I should be  the same cause of chaos and of the end of all mankind.   \",\"  Just as, with attachment, the unenlightened perform all actions, O Arjuna,  even so, but unattached, should the enlightened man act, with a desire for the  welfare of humanity.   \",\"  The enlightened may not confuse the mind of the unenlightened, who are  attached to action; rather must he perform all actions unattached, and thus  encourage them to do likewise.   \",\"  All action is entirely done by the gunas of prakriti. Man, deluded by the  sense of \\u2018I', thinks, \\u2018I am the doer'.    \",\"  But he, O Arjuna, who understands the truth of the various gunas and  their various activities, knows that it is the gunas that operate on the gunas; he  does not claim to be the doer.   \",\"  Deluded by the gunas of prakriti men become attached to the activities of  the gunas; he who knows the truth of things should not unhinge the  slow-witted who have not the knowledge.   \",\"  Cast all your acts on Me, with your mind fixed on the indwelling soul, and  without any thought of fruit, or sense of \\u2018mine' shake off your fever and fight!   \",\"  Those who always act according to the rule I have here laid down, in faith  and without cavilling\\u2014they too are released from the bondage of their actions.   \",\"  But those who cavil at the rule and refuse to conform to it are fools, dead to  all knowledge; know that they are lost.   \",\"  Even a man of knowledge acts according to his nature; all creatures follow  their nature; what then will constraint avail?   \",\"  Each sense has its settled likes and dislikes towards its objects; man should  not come under the sway of these, for they are his besetters.   \",\"  Better one's own duty, bereft of merit, than another's well-performed; better  is death in the discharge of one's duty; another's duty is fraught with danger.   Arjuna Said:   \",\"  Then what impels man to sin, O Krishna, even against his will, as though  by force compelled?  The Lord Said:   \",\"  It is Lust, it is Wrath, born of the guna\\u2014Rajas. It is the arch-devourer, the  arch-sinner. Know this to be man's enemy here.   \",\"  As fire is obscured by smoke, a mirror by dirt, and the embryo by the  amnion, so is knowledge obscured by this.   \",\"  Knowledge is obscured, O Arjuna, by this eternal enemy of the wise man,  in the form of Lust, the insatiable fire.   \",\"  The senses, the mind and the reason are said to be its great seat; by means of  these it obscures knowledge and stupefies man.    \",\"  Therefore, O Arjuna, bridle you first the senses and then rid yourself  of this sinner, the destroyer of knowledge and discrimination.   \",\"  Subtle, they say, are the senses; subtler than the senses is the mind; subtler  than the mind is the reason; but subtler even than the reason is He.     \",\"  Thus realizing Him to be subtler than the reason, and controlling the self by  the Self (Atman), destroy, O Arjuna, this enemy\\u2014Lust, so hard to  overcome. \",\"\\u201cArjuna questioned: My Lord! If Wisdom is above action, why do You advise me to engage in this terrible fight? \",\" Your language perplexes me and confuses my reason. Therefore please tell me the only way by which I may, without doubt, secure my spiritual welfare. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: In this world, as I have said, there is a twofold path, O Sinless One! There is the Path of Wisdom for those who meditate, and the Path of Action for those who work. \",\" No man can attain freedom from activity by refraining from action; nor can he reach perfection by merely refusing to act. \",\" He cannot even for a moment remain really inactive, for the Qualities of Nature will compel him to act whether he will or no. \",\" He who remains motionless, refusing to act, but all the while brooding over sensuous object, that deluded soul is simply a hypocrite. \",\" But, O Arjuna! All honour to him whose mind controls his senses, for he is thereby beginning to practise Karma-Yoga, the Path of Right Action, keeping himself always unattached. \",\" Do your duty as prescribed, for action for duty\\u2019s sake is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of the body would be impossible if man remained inactive. \",\" In this world people are fettered by action, unless it is performed as a sacrifice. Therefore, O Arjuna, let your acts be done without attachment, as sacrifice only. \",\" In the beginning, when God created all beings by the sacrifice of Himself, He said unto them: `Through sacrifice you can procreate, and it shall satisfy all your desires. \",\" Worship the Powers of Nature thereby, and let them nourish you in return; thus supporting each other, you shall attain your highest welfare. \",\" For, fed, on sacrifice, nature will give you all the enjoyment you can desire. But he who enjoys what she gives without returning is, indeed, a robber.\\u2019 \",\" The sages who enjoy the food that remains after the sacrifice is made are freed from all sin; but the selfish who spread their feast only for themselves feed on sin only. \",\" All creatures are the product of food, food is the product of rain, rain comes by sacrifice, and sacrifice is the noblest form of action. \",\" All action originates in the Supreme Spirit, which is Imperishable, and in sacrificial action the all-pervading Spirit is consciously present. \",\" Thus he who does not help the revolving wheel of sacrifice, but instead leads a sinful life, rejoicing in the gratification of his senses, O Arjuna, he breathes in vain. \",\" On the other hand, the soul who meditates on the Self is content to serve the Self and rests satisfied within the Self; there remains nothing more for him to accomplish. \",\" He has nothing to gain by the performance or non-performance of action. His welfare depends not on any contribution that an earthly creature can make. \",\" Therefore do your duty perfectly, without care for the results, for he who does his duty disinterestedly attains the Supreme. \",\" King Janaka and others attained perfection through action alone. Even for the sake of enlightening the world, it is your duty to act; \",\" For whatever a great man does, others imitate. People conform to the standard which he has set. \",\" There is nothing in this universe, O Arjuna, that I am compelled to do, nor anything for Me to attain; yet I am persistently active. \",\" For were I not to act without ceasing, O prince, people would be glad to do likewise. \",\" And if I were to refrain from action, the human race would be ruined; I should lead the world to chaos, and destruction would follow. \",\" As the ignorant act, because of their fondness for action, so should the wise act without such attachment, fixing their eyes, O Arjuna, only on the welfare of the world. \",\" But a wise man should not perturb the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to action; let him perform his own actions in the right spirit, with concentration on Me, thus inspiring all to do the same. \",\" Action is the product of the Qualities inherent in Nature. It is only the ignorant man who, misled by personal egotism, says: `I am the doer.\\u2019 \",\" But he, O Mighty One, who understands correctly the relation of the Qualities to action, is not attached to the act for he perceives that it is merely the action and reaction of the Qualities among themselves. \",\" Those who do not understand the Qualities are interested in the act. Still, the wise man who knows the truth should not disturb the mind of him who does not. \",\" Therefore, surrendering your actions unto Me, your thoughts concentrated on the Absolute, free from selfishness and without anticipation of reward, with mind devoid of excitement, begin you to fight. \",\" Those who always act in accordance with My precepts, firm in faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from the bondage of action. \",\" But they who ridicule My word and do not keep it, are ignorant, devoid of wisdom and blind. They seek but their own destruction. \",\" Even the wise man acts in character with his nature; indeed, all creatures act according to their natures. What is the use of compulsion then? \",\" The love and hate which are aroused by the objects of sense arise from Nature; do not yield to them. They only obstruct the path. \",\" It is better to do yours own duty, however lacking in merit, than to do that of another, even though efficiently. It is better to die doing one\\u2019s own duty, for to do the duty of another is fraught with danger. \",\" Arjuna asked: My Lord! Tell me, what is it that drives a man to sin, even against his will and as if by compulsion? \",\" Lord Shri Krishna: It is desire, it is aversion, born of passion. Desire consumes and corrupts everything. It is man\\u2019s greatest enemy. \",\" As fire is shrouded in smoke, a mirror by dust and a child by the womb, so is the universe enveloped in desire. \",\" It is the wise man\\u2019s constant enemy; it tarnishes the face of wisdom. It is as insatiable as a flame of fire. \",\" It works through the senses, the mind and the reason; and with their help destroys wisdom and confounds the soul. \",\" Therefore, O Arjuna, first control your senses and then slay desire, for it is full of sin, and is the destroyer of knowledge and of wisdom. \",\" It is said that the senses are powerful. But beyond the senses is the mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, and beyond and greater than intellect is He. \",\" Thus, O Mighty-in-Arms, knowing Him to be beyond the intellect and, by His help, subduing your personal egotism, kill yours enemy, Desire, extremely difficult though it be.\\u201d \",\"DHRITARASHTRA:  O Sanjaya, tell me what happened at Kurukshetra, the field of dharma, where my family and the Pandavas gathered to fight. \",\"SANJAYA:  Having surveyed the forces of the Pandavas arrayed for battle, prince Duryodhana approached his teacher, Drona, and spoke. \",\"O my teacher, look at this mighty army of the Pandavas, assembled by your own gifted disciple, Yudhishthira. \",\"There are heroic warriors and great archers who are the equals of Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana, Virata, the mighty Drupada, \",\"Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant king of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja,the great leader Shaibya, \",\"the powerful Yudhamanyu, the valiant Uttamaujas, and the son of Subhadra, in addition to the sons of Draupadi. All these command mighty chariots. \",\"O best of brahmins, listen to the names of those who are distinguished among our own forces: \",\"Bhishma, Karna, and the victorious Kripa; Ashvatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta. \",\"There are many others, too, heroes giving up their lives for my sake, all proficient in war and armed with a variety of weapons. \",\"Our army is unlimited and commanded by Bhishma; theirs is small and commanded by Bhima. \",\"Let everyone take his proper place and stand firm supporting Bhishma! \",\"Then the powerful Bhishma, the grandsire, oldest of all the Kurus, in order to cheer Duryodhana, roared like a lion and blew his conch horn. \",\"And after Bhishma, a tremendous noise arose of conchs and cow horns and pounding on drums. \",\"Then Sri Krishna and Arjuna, who were standing in a mighty chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conchs. \",\"Sri Krishna blew the conch named Panchajanya, and Arjuna blew that called Devadatta. The mighty Bhima blew the huge conch Paundra. \",\"Yudhishthira, the king, the son of Kunti, blew the conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conchs as well. \",\"Then the king of Kashi, the leading bowman, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, Virata, the invincible Satyaki, \",\"Drupada, all the sons of Draupadi, and the strong-armed son of Subhadra joined in, \",\"and the noise tore through the heart of Duryodhanas army. Indeed, the sound was tumultuous, echoing throughout heaven and earth. \",\"Then, O Dhritarashtra, lord of the earth, having seen your sons forces set in their places and the fighting about to begin, Arjuna spoke these words to Sri Krishna:\",\"ARJUNA:  O Krishna, drive my chariot between the two armies. \",\"I want to see those who desire to fight with me. With whom will this battle be fought? \",\"I want to see those assembled to fight for Duryodhana, those who seek to please the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra by engaging in war. \",\"SANJAYA: Thus Arjuna spoke, and Sri Krishna, driving his splendid chariot between the two armies, \",\"facing Bhishma and Drona and all the kings of the earth, said: Arjuna, behold all the Kurus gathered together. \",\"And Arjuna, standing between the two armies, saw fathers and grandfathers, teachers, uncles, and brothers, sons and grandsons, \",\"in-laws and friends. Seeing his kinsmen established in opposition, \",\"Arjuna was overcome by sorrow. Despairing, he spoke these words: ARJUNA:  O Krishna, I see my own relations here anxious to fight, \",\"and my limbs grow weak; my mouth is dry, my body shakes, and my hair is standing on end. \",\"My skin burns, and the bow Gandiva has slipped from my hand. I am unable to stand; my mind seems to be whirling. \",\"These signs bode evil for us. I do not see that any good can come from killing our relations in battle. \",\"O Krishna, I have no desire for victory, or for a kingdom or pleasures. Of what use is a kingdom or pleasure or even life, \",\"if those for whose sake we desire these things  \",\"teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, in-laws, grandsons, and others with family ties  are engaging in this battle, renouncing their wealth and their lives? \",\"Even if they were to kill me, I would not want to kill them, not even to become ruler of the three worlds. How much less for the earth alone? \",\"O Krishna, what satisfaction could we find in killing Dhritarashtras sons? We would become sinners by slaying these men, even though they are evil. \",\"The sons of Dhritarashtra are related to us; therefore, we should not kill them. How can we gain happiness by killing members of our own family? \",\"Though they are overpowered by greed and see no evil in destroying families or injuring friends, we see these evils. \",\"Why shouldnt we turn away from this sin? \",\"When a family declines, ancient traditions are destroyed. With them are lost the spiritual foundations for life, and the family loses its sense of unity. \",\"Where there is no sense of unity, the women of the family become corrupt; and with the corruption of its women, society is plunged into chaos. \",\"Social chaos is hell for the family and for those who have destroyed the family as well. It disrupts the process of spiritual evolution begun by our ancestors. \",\"The timeless spiritual foundations of family and society would be destroyed by these terrible deeds, which violate the unity of life. \",\"It is said that those whose family dharma has been destroyed dwell in hell. \",\"This is a great sin! We are prepared to kill our own relations out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom. \",\"Better for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, were to attack me in battle and kill me unarmed and unresisting. \",\"SANJAYA: Overwhelmed by sorrow, Arjuna spoke these words. And casting away his bow and his arrows, he sat down in his chariot in the middle of the battlefield.\",\"SANJAYA: These are the words that Sri Krishna spoke to the despairing Arjuna, whose eyes were burning with tears of pity and confusion. \",\"KRISHNA  This despair and weakness in a time of crisis are mean and unworthy of you, Arjuna. How have you fallen into a state so far from the path to liberation? \",\"It does not become you to yield to this weakness. Arise with a brave heart and destroy the enemy. \",\"ARJUNA:  How can I ever bring myself to fight against Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of reverence? How can I, Krishna? \",\"Surely it would be better to spend my life begging than to kill these great and worthy souls! If I killed them, every pleasure I found would be tainted. \",\"I dont even know which would be better, for us to conquer them or for them to conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashtra have confronted us; but why would we care to live if we killed them? \",\"My will is paralyzed, and I am utterly confused. Tell me which is the better path for me. Let me be your disciple. I have fallen at your feet; give me instruction. \",\"What can overcome a sorrow that saps all my vitality? Even power over men and gods or the wealth of an empire seem empty. \",\"SANJAYA: This is how Arjuna, the great warrior, spoke to Sri Krishna. With the words, O Krishna, I will not fight, he fell silent. \",\"As they stood between the two armies, Sri Krishna smiled and replied to Arjuna, who had sunk into despair. \",\"KRISHNA: You speak sincerely, but your sorrow has no cause. The wise grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. \",\"There has never been a time when you and I and the kings gathered here have not existed, nor will there be a time when we will cease to exist. \",\"As the same person inhabits the body through childhood, youth, and old age, so too at the time of death he attains another body. The wise are not deluded by these changes. \",\"When the senses contact sense objects, a person experiences cold or heat, pleasure or pain. These experiences are fleeting; they come and go. Bear them patiently, Arjuna. \",\"Those who are unaffected by these changes, who are the same in pleasure and pain, are truly wise and fit for immortality. Assert your strength and realize this! \",\"The impermanent has no reality; reality lies in the eternal. Those who have seen the boundary between these two have attained the end of all knowledge. \",\"Realize that which pervades the universe and is indestructible; no power can affect this unchanging, imperishable reality. \",\"The body is mortal, but that which dwells in the body is immortal and immeasurable. Therefore, Arjuna, fight in this battle. \",\"One believes he is the slayer, another believes he is the slain. Both are ignorant; there is neither slayer nor slain. \",\"You were never born; you will never die. You have never changed; you can never change. Unborn, eternal, immutable, immemorial, you do not die when the body dies. \",\"Realizing that which is indestructible, eternal, unborn, and unchanging, how can you slay or cause another to slay? \",\"As one abandons worn-out clothes and acquires new ones, so when the body is worn out a new one is acquired by the Self, who lives within. \",\"The Self cannot be pierced by weapons or burned by fire; water cannot wet it, nor can the wind dry it. \",\"The Self cannot be pierced or burned, made wet or dry. It is everlasting and infinite, standing on the motionless foundations of eternity. \",\"The Self is unmanifested, beyond all thought, beyond all change. Knowing this, you should not grieve. \",\"O mighty Arjuna, even if you believe the Self to be subject to birth and death, you should not grieve. \",\"Death is inevitable for the living; birth is inevitable for the dead. Since these are unavoidable, you should not sorrow. \",\"Every creature is unmanifested at first and then attains manifestation. When its end has come, it once again becomes unmanifested. What is there to lament in this? \",\"The glory of the Self is beheld by a few, and a few describe it; a few listen, but many without understanding. \",\"The Self of all beings, living within the body, is eternal and cannot be harmed. Therefore, do not grieve. \",\"Considering your dharma, you should not vacillate. For a warrior, nothing is higher than a war against evil. \",\"The warrior confronted with such a war should be pleased, Arjuna, for it comes as an open gate to heaven. \",\"But if you do not participate in this battle against evil, you will incur sin, violating your dharma and your honor. \",\"The story of your dishonor will be repeated endlessly: and for a man of honor, dishonor is worse than death. \",\"These brave warriors will think you have withdrawn from battle out of fear, and those who formerly esteemed you will treat you with disrespect. \",\"Your enemies will ridicule your strength and say things that should not be said. What could be more painful than this? \",\"Death means the attainment of heaven; victory means the enjoyment of the earth. Therefore rise up, Arjuna, resolved to fight! \",\"Having made yourself alike in pain and pleasure, profit and loss, victory and defeat, engage in this great battle and you will be freed from sin.  \",\"You have heard the intellectual explanation of Sankhya, Arjuna; now listen to the principles of yoga. By practicing these you can break through the bonds of karma. \",\"On this path effort never goes to waste, and there is no failure. Even a little effort toward spiritual awareness will protect you from the greatest fear.\",\"Those who follow this path, resolving deep within themselves to seek me alone, attain singleness of purpose. For those who lack resolution, the decisions of life are many-branched and endless. \",\"There are ignorant people who speak flowery words and take delight in the letter of the law, saying that there is nothing else. \",\"Their hearts are full of selfish desires, Arjuna. Their idea of heaven is their own enjoyment, and the aim of all their activities is pleasure and power. The fruit of their actions is continual rebirth. \",\"Those whose minds are swept away by the pursuit of pleasure and power are incapable of following the supreme goal and will not attain samadhi. \",\"The scriptures describe the three gunas. But you should be free from the action of the gunas, established in eternal truth, selfcontrolled, without any sense of duality or the desire to acquire and hoard. \",\"Just as a reservoir is of little use when the whole countryside is flooded, scriptures are of little use to the illumined man or woman, who sees the Lord everywhere. \",\"You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. \",\"Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself  without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. \",\"Seek refuge in the attitude of detachment and you will amass the wealth of spiritual awareness. Those who are motivated only by desire for the fruits of action are miserable, for they are constantly anxious about the results of what they do. \",\"When consciousness is unified, however, all vain anxiety is left behind. There is no cause for worry, whether things go well or ill. Therefore, devote yourself to the disciplines of yoga, for yoga is skill in action. \",\"The wise unify their consciousness and abandon attachment to the fruits of action, which binds a person to continual rebirth. Thus they attain a state beyond all evil. \",\"When your mind has overcome the confusion of duality, you will attain the state of holy indifference to things you hear and things you have heard. \",\"When you are unmoved by the confusion of ideas and your mind is completely united in deep samadhi, you will attain the state of perfect yoga. \",\"ARJUNA:  Tell me of those who live established in wisdom, ever aware of the Self, O Krishna. How do they talk? How sit? How move about? \",\"KRISHNA: They live in wisdom who see themselves in all and all in them, who have renounced every selfish desire and sense craving tormenting the heart. \",\"Neither agitated by grief nor hankering after pleasure, they live free from lust and fear and anger. Established in meditation, they are truly wise. \",\"Fettered no more by selfish attachments, they are neither elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. Such are the seers. \",\"Even as a tortoise draws in its limbs, the wise can draw in their senses at will. \",\"Aspirants abstain from sense pleasures, but they still crave for them. These cravings all disappear when they see the highest goal. \",\"Even of those who tread the path, the stormy senses can sweep off the mind. \",\"They live in wisdom who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in me. \",\"When you keep thinking about sense objects, attachment comes. Attachment breeds desire, the lust of possession that burns to anger. \",\"Anger clouds the judgment; you can no longer learn from past mistakes. Lost is the power to choose between what is wise and what is unwise, and your life is utter waste. \",\"But when you move amidst the world of sense, free from attachment and aversion alike, \",\"there comes the peace in which all sorrows end, and you live in the wisdom of the Self. \",\"The disunited mind is far from wise; how can it meditate? How be at peace? When you know no peace, how can you know joy? \",\"When you let your mind follow the call of the senses, they carry away your better judgment as storms drive a boat off its charted course on the sea. \",\"Use all your power to free the senses from attachment and aversion alike, and live in the full wisdom of the Self. \",\"Such a sage awakes to light in the night of all creatures. That which the world calls day is the night of ignorance to the wise. \",\"As rivers flow into the ocean but cannot make the vast ocean overflow, so flow the streams of the sense-world into the sea of peace that is the sage. But this is not so with the desirer of desires. \",\"They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and break away from the ego-cage of I, me, and mine to be united with the Lord.  This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality.\",\"ARJUNA:  O Krishna, you have said that knowledge is greater than action; why then do you ask me to wage this terrible war? \",\"Your advice seems inconsistent. Give me one path to follow to the supreme good. \",\"KRISHNA:  At the beginning of time I declared two paths for the pure heart: jnana yoga, the contemplative path of spiritual wisdom, and karma yoga, the active path of selfless service. \",\"One who shirks action does not attain freedom; no one can gain perfection by abstaining from work. \",\"Indeed, there is no one who rests for even an instant; all creatures are driven to action by their own nature. \",\"Those who abstain from action while allowing the mind to dwell on sensual pleasure cannot be called sincere spiritual aspirants. \",\"But they excel who control their senses through the mind, using them for selfless service. \",\"Fulfill all your duties; action is better than inaction. Even to maintain your body, Arjuna, you are obliged to act. \",\"Selfish action imprisons the world. Act selflessly, without any thought of personal profit. \",\"At the beginning, mankind and the obligation of selfless service were created together. Through selfless service, you will always be fruitful and find the fulfillment of your desires: this is the promise of the Creator. \",\"Honor and cherish the devas as they honor and cherish you; through this honor and love you will attain the supreme good. \",\"All human desires are fulfilled by the devas, who are pleased by selfless service. But anyone who enjoys the things given by the devas without offering selfless acts in return is a thief. \",\"The spiritually minded, who eat in the spirit of service, are freed from all their sins; but the selfish, who prepare food for their own satisfaction, eat sin. \",\"Living creatures are nourished by food, and food is nourished by rain; rain itself is the water of life, which comes from selfless worship and service. \",\"Every selfless act, Arjuna, is born from Brahman, the eternal, infinite Godhead. Brahman is present in every act of service. \",\"All life turns on this law, O Arjuna. Those who violate it, indulging the senses for their own pleasure and ignoring the needs of others, have wasted their life. \",\"But those who realize the Self are always satisfied. Having found the source of joy and fulfillment, they no longer seek happiness from the external world. \",\"They have nothing to gain or lose by any action; neither people nor things can affect their security. \",\"Strive constantly to serve the welfare of the world; by devotion to selfless work one attains the supreme goal of life. \",\"Do your work with the welfare of others always in mind. It was by such work that Janaka attained perfection; others too have followed this path. \",\"What the outstanding person does, others will try to do. The standards such people create will be followed by the whole world. \",\"There is nothing in the three worlds for me to gain, Arjuna, nor is there anything I do not have; I continue to act, but I am not driven by any need of my own. \",\"If I ever refrained from continuous work, everyone would immediately follow my example. \",\"If I stopped working I would be the cause of cosmic chaos, and finally of the destruction of this world and these people. \",\"The ignorant work for their own profit, Arjuna; the wise work for the welfare of the world, without thought for themselves. \",\"By abstaining from work you will confuse the ignorant, who are engrossed in their actions. Perform all work carefully, guided by compassion. \",\"All actions are performed by the gunas of prakriti. Deluded by identification with the ego, a person thinks, I am the doer. \",\"But the illumined man or woman understands the domain of the gunas and is not attached. Such people know that the gunas interact with each other; they do not claim to be the doer. \",\"Those who are deluded by the operation of the gunas become attached to the results of their action. Those who understand these truths should not unsettle the ignorant. \",\"Performing all actions for my sake, completely absorbed in the Self, and without expectations, fight!  but stay free from the fever of the ego. \",\"Those who live in accordance with these divine laws without complaining, firmly established in faith, are released from karma. \",\"Those who violate these laws, criticizing and complaining, are utterly deluded, and are the cause of their own suffering. \",\"Even the wise act within the limitations of their own nature. Every creature is subject to prakriti; what is the use of repression? \",\"The senses have been conditioned by attraction to the pleasant and aversion to the unpleasant. Do not be ruled by them; they are obstacles in your path. \",\"It is better to strive in ones own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another. Nothing is ever lost in following ones own dharma, but competition in anothers dharma breeds fear and insecurity. \",\"ARJUNA:  What is the force that binds us to selfish deeds, O Krishna? What power moves us, even against our will, as if forcing us? \",\"KRISHNA: It is selfish desire and anger, arising from the guna of rajas; these are the appetites and evils which threaten a person in this life. \",\"Just as a fire is covered by smoke and a mirror is obscured by dust, just as the embryo rests deep within the womb, knowledge is hidden by selfish desire  \",\"hidden, Arjuna, by this unquenchable fire for self-satisfaction, the inveterate enemy of the wise. \",\"Selfish desire is found in the senses, mind, and intellect, misleading them and burying the understanding in delusion. \",\"Fight with all your strength, Arjuna! Controlling your senses, conquer your enemy, the destroyer of knowledge and realization. \",\"The senses are higher than the body, the mind higher than the senses; above the mind is the intellect, and above the intellect is the Atman. \",\"Thus, knowing that which is supreme, let the Atman rule the ego. Use your mighty arms to slay the fierce enemy that is selfish desire.\",\"KRISHNA: I told this eternal secret to Vivasvat. Vivasvat taught Manu, and Manu taught Ikshvaku. \",\"Thus, Arjuna, eminent sages received knowledge of yoga in a continuous tradition. But through time the practice of yoga was lost in the world. \",\"The secret of these teachings is profound. I have explained them to you today because you are my friend and devotee. \",\"ARJUNA:  You were born much after Vivasvat; he lived very long ago. Why do you say that you taught this yoga in the beginning? \",\"KRISHNA:  You and I have passed through many births, Arjuna. You have forgotten, but I remember them all. \",\"My true being is unborn and changeless. I am the Lord who dwells in every creature. Through the power of my own maya, I manifest myself in a finite form. \",\"Whenever dharma declines and the purpose of life is forgotten, I manifest myself on earth. \",\"I am born in every age to protect the good, to destroy evil, and to reestablish dharma. \",\"Those who know me as their own divine Self break through the belief that they are the body and are not reborn as separate creatures. Such a one, Arjuna, is united with me. \",\"Delivered from selfish attachment, fear, and anger, filled with me, surrendering themselves to me, purified in the fire of my being, many have reached the state of unity in me. \",\"As they approach me, so I receive them. All paths, Arjuna, lead to me. \",\"Those desiring success in their actions worship the gods; through action in the world of mortals, their desires are quickly fulfilled. \",\"The distinctions of caste, guna, and karma have come from me. I am their cause, but I myself am changeless and beyond all action. \",\"Actions do not cling to me because I am not attached to their results. Those who understand this and practice it live in freedom. \",\"Knowing this truth, aspirants desiring liberation in ancient times engaged in action. You too can do the same, pursuing an active life in the manner of those ancient sages. \",\"What is action and what is inaction? This question has confused the greatest sages. I will give you the secret of action, with which you can free yourself from bondage. \",\"The true nature of action is difficult to grasp. You must understand what is action and what is inaction, and what kind of action should be avoided. \",\"The wise see that there is action in the midst of inaction and inaction in the midst of action. Their consciousness is unified, and every act is done with complete awareness. \",\"The awakened sages call a person wise when all his undertakings are free from anxiety about results; all his selfish desires have been consumed in the fire of knowledge. \",\"The wise, ever satisfied, have abandoned all external supports. Their security is unaffected by the results of their action; even while acting, they really do nothing at all. \",\"Free from expectations and from all sense of possession, with mind and body firmly controlled by the Self, they do not incur sin by the performance of physical action. \",\"They live in freedom who have gone beyond the dualities of life. Competing with no one, they are alike in success and failure and content with whatever comes to them. \",\"They are free, without selfish attachments; their minds are fixed in knowledge. They perform all work in the spirit of service, and their karma is dissolved. \",\"The process of offering is Brahman; that which is offered is Brahman. Brahman offers the sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. Brahman is attained by those who see Brahman in every action. \",\"Some aspirants offer material sacrifices to the gods. Others offer selfless service as sacrifice in the fire of Brahman. \",\"Some renounce all enjoyment of the senses, sacrificing them in the fire of sense restraint. Others partake of sense objects but offer them in service through the fire of the senses. \",\"Some offer the workings of the senses and the vital forces through the fire of self-control, kindled in the path of knowledge. \",\"Some offer wealth; others offer sense restraint and suffering. Some take vows and offer knowledge and study of the scriptures; and some make the offering of meditation. \",\"Some offer the forces of vitality, regulating their inhalation and exhalation, and thus gain control over these forces. \",\"Others offer the forces of vitality through restraint of their senses. All these understand the meaning of service and will be cleansed of their impurities. \",\"True sustenance is in service, and through it a man or woman reaches the eternal Brahman. But those who do not seek to serve are without a home in this world. Arjuna, how can they be at home in any world to come? \",\"These offerings are born of work, and each guides mankind along a path to Brahman. Understanding this, you will attain liberation. \",\"The offering of wisdom is better than any material offering, Arjuna; for the goal of all work is spiritual wisdom. \",\"Approach those who have realized the purpose of life and question them with reverence and devotion; they will instruct you in this wisdom. \",\"Once you attain it, you will never again be deluded. You will see all creatures in the Self, and all in me. \",\"Even if you were the most sinful of sinners, Arjuna, you could cross beyond all sin by the raft of spiritual wisdom. \",\"As the heat of a fire reduces wood to ashes, the fire of knowledge burns to ashes all karma. \",\"Nothing in this world purifies like spiritual wisdom. It is the perfection achieved in time through the path of yoga, the path which leads to the Self within. \",\"Those who take wisdom as their highest goal, whose faith is deep and whose senses are trained, attain wisdom quickly and enter into perfect peace. \",\"But the ignorant, indecisive and lacking in faith, waste their lives. They can never be happy in this world or any other. \",\"Those established in the Self have renounced selfish attachments to their actions and cut through doubts with spiritual wisdom. They act in freedom. \",\"Arjuna, cut through this doubt in your own heart with the sword of spiritual wisdom. Arise; take up the path of yoga!\",\" ARJUNA:  O Krishna, you have recommended both the path of selfless action and sannyasa, the path of renunciation of action. Tell me definitely which is better. \",\" KRISHNA:  Both renunciation of action and the selfless performance of action lead to the supreme goal. But the path of action is better than renunciation. \",\" Those who have attained perfect renunciation are free from any sense of duality; they are unaffected by likes and dislikes, Arjuna, and are free from the bondage of self-will. \",\" The immature think that knowledge and action are different, but the wise see them as the same. The person who is established in one path will attain the rewards of both. \",\" The goal of knowledge and the goal of service are the same; those who fail to see this are blind. \",\" Perfect renunciation is difficult to attain without performing action. But the wise, following the path of selfless service, quickly reach Brahman. \",\" Those who follow the path of service, who have completely purified themselves and conquered their senses and self-will, see the Self in all creatures and are untouched by any action they perform. \",\" Those who know this truth, whose consciousness is unified, think always, I am not the doer. While seeing or hearing, touching or smelling; eating, moving about, or sleeping; breathing\",\" or speaking, letting go or holding on, even opening or closing the eyes, they understand that these are only the movements of the senses among sense objects. \",\" Those who surrender to Brahman all selfish attachments are like the leaf of a lotus floating clean and dry in water. Sin cannot touch them. \",\" Renouncing their selfish attachments, those who follow the path of service work with body, senses, and mind for the sake of self-purification. \",\" Those whose consciousness is unified abandon all attachment to the results of action and attain supreme peace. But those whose desires are fragmented, who are selfishly attached to the results of their work, are bound in everything they do. \",\" Those who renounce attachment in all their deeds live content in the city of nine gates, the body, as its master. They are not driven to act, nor do they involve others in action. \",\" Neither the sense of acting, nor actions, nor the connection of cause and effect comes from the Lord of this world. These three arise from nature. \",\" The Lord does not partake in the good and evil deeds of any person; judgment is clouded when wisdom is obscured by ignorance. \",\" But ignorance is destroyed by knowledge of the Self within. The light of this knowledge shines like the sun, revealing the supreme Brahman. \",\" Those who cast off sin through this knowledge, absorbed in the Lord and established in him as their one goal and refuge, are not reborn as separate creatures. \",\" Those who possess this wisdom have equal regard for all. They see the same Self in a spiritual aspirant and an outcaste, in an elephant, a cow, and a dog. \",\" Such people have mastered life. With even mind they rest in Brahman, who is perfect and is everywhere the same. \",\" They are not elated by good fortune nor depressed by bad. With mind established in Brahman, they are free from delusion. \",\" Not dependent on any external support, they realize the joy of spiritual awareness. With consciousness unified through meditation, they live in abiding joy. \",\" Pleasures conceived in the world of the senses have a beginning and an end and give birth to misery, Arjuna. The wise do not look for happiness in them. \",\" But those who overcome the impulses of lust and anger which arise in the body are made whole and live in joy. \",\" They find their joy, their rest, and their light completely within themselves. United with the Lord, they attain nirvana in Brahman. \",\" Healed of their sins and conflicts, working for the good of all beings, the holy sages attain nirvana in Brahman. \",\" Free from anger and selfish desire, unified in mind, those who follow the path of yoga and realize the Self are established forever in that supreme state. \",\" Closing their eyes, steadying their breathing, and focusing their attention on the center of spiritual consciousness, \",\" the wise master their senses, mind, and intellect through meditation. Self-realization is their only goal. Freed from selfish desire, fear, and anger, they live in freedom always. \",\" Knowing me as the friend of all creatures, the Lord of the universe, the end of all offerings and all spiritual disciplines, they attain eternal peace. \",\" KRISHNA:  It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those who work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of meditation. Theirs is true renunciation. \",\" Therefore, Arjuna, you should understand that renunciation and the performance of selfless service are the same. Those who cannot renounce attachment to the results of their work are far from the path. \",\"  For aspirants who want to climb the mountain of spiritual awareness, the path is selfless work; for those who have ascended to yoga the path is stillness and peace. \",\" When a person has freed himself from attachment to the results of work, and from desires for the enjoyment of sense objects, he ascends to the unitive state. \",\"  Reshape yourself through the power of your will; never let yourself be degraded by self-will. The will is the only friend of the Self, and the will is the only enemy of the Self. \",\"  To those who have conquered themselves, the will is a friend. But it is the enemy of those who have not found the Self within them. \",\"  The supreme Reality stands revealed in the consciousness of those who have conquered themselves. They live in peace, alike in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. \",\"  They are completely fulfilled by spiritual wisdom and Selfrealization. Having conquered their senses, they have climbed to the summit of human consciousness. To such people a clod of dirt, a stone, and gold are the same. \",\" They are equally disposed to family, enemies, and friends, to those who support them and those who are hostile, to the good and the evil alike. Because they are impartial, they rise to great heights. \",\" Those who aspire to the state of yoga should seek the Self in inner solitude through meditation. With body and mind controlled they should constantly practice one-pointedness, free from expectations and attachment to material possessions. \",\"  Select a clean spot, neither too high nor too low, and seat yourself firmly on a cloth, a deerskin, and kusha grass. \",\" Then, once seated, strive to still your thoughts. Make your mind one-pointed in meditation, and your heart will be purified. \",\" Hold your body, head, and neck firmly in a straight line, and keep your eyes from wandering. \",\" With all fears dissolved in the peace of the Self and all desires dedicated to Brahman, controlling the mind and fixing it on me, sit in meditation with me as your only goal. \",\" With senses and mind constantly controlled through meditation, united with the Self within, an aspirant attains nirvana, the state of abiding joy and peace in me. \",\"  Arjuna, those who eat too much or eat too little, who sleep too much or sleep too little, will not succeed in meditation. \",\" But those who are temperate in eating and sleeping, work and recreation, will come to the end of sorrow through meditation. \",\" Through constant effort they learn to withdraw the mind from selfish cravings and absorb it in the Self. Thus they attain the state of union. \",\"  When meditation is mastered, the mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp in a windless place. \",\" In the still mind, in the depths of meditation, the Self reveals itself. Beholding the Self by means of the Self, an aspirant knows the joy and peace of complete fulfillment. \",\" Having attained that abiding joy beyond the senses, revealed in the stilled mind, he never swerves from the eternal truth. \",\" He desires nothing else, and cannot be shaken by the heaviest burden of sorrow. \",\" The practice of meditation frees one from all affliction. This is the path of yoga. Follow it with determination and sustained enthusiasm. \",\" Renouncing wholeheartedly all selfish desires and expectations, use your will to control the senses. \",\" Little by little, through patience and repeated effort, the mind will become stilled in the Self. \",\"  Wherever the mind wanders, restless and diffuse in its search for satisfaction without, lead it within; train it to rest in the Self \",\" Abiding joy comes to those who still the mind. Freeing themselves from the taint of self-will, with their consciousness unified, they become one with Brahman. \",\"  The infinite joy of touching Brahman is easily attained by those who are free from the burden of evil and established within themselves. \",\" They see the Self in every creature and all creation in the Self. With consciousness unified through meditation, they see everything with an equal eye. \",\"  I am ever present to those who have realized me in every creature. Seeing all life as my manifestation, they are never separated from me. \",\" They worship me in the hearts of all, and all their actions proceed from me. Wherever they may live, they abide in me. \",\"  When a person responds to the joys and sorrows of others as if they were his own, he has attained the highest state of spiritual union. \",\"  ARJUNA:  O Krishna, the stillness of divine union which you describe is beyond my comprehension. How can the mind, which is so restless, attain lasting peace? \",\" Krishna, the mind is restless, turbulent, powerful, violent; trying to control it is like trying to tame the wind. \",\"  KRISHNA:  It is true that the mind is restless and difficult to control. But it can be conquered, Arjuna, through regular practice and detachment. \",\" Those who lack self-control will find it difficult to progress in meditation; but those who are self-controlled, striving earnestly through the right means, will attain the goal. \",\"  ARJUNA:  Krishna, what happens to the man who has faith but who lacks self-control and wanders from the path, not attaining success in yoga? \",\" If a man becomes deluded on the spiritual path, will he lose the support of both worlds, like a cloud scattered in the sky? \",\" Krishna, you can dispel all doubts; remove this doubt which binds me. \",\"  KRISHNA:  Arjuna, my son, such a person will not be destroyed. No one who does good work will ever come to a bad end, either here or in the world to come. \",\"  When such people die, they go to other realms where the righteous live. They dwell there for countless years and then are reborn into a home which is pure and prosperous. \",\" Or they may be born into a family where meditation is practiced; to be born into such a family is extremely rare. \",\" The wisdom they have acquired in previous lives will be reawakened, Arjuna, and they will strive even harder for Self-realization. \",\" Indeed, they will be driven on by the strength of their past disciplines. Even one who inquires after the practice of meditation rises above those who simply perform rituals. \",\"  Through constant effort over many lifetimes, a person becomes purified of all selfish desires and attains the supreme goal of life. \",\"  Meditation is superior to severe asceticism and the path of knowledge. It is also superior to selfless service. May you attain the goal of meditation, Arjuna! \",\" Even among those who meditate, that  man or woman who worships me with perfect faith, completely absorbed in me, is the most firmly established in yoga.  \",\" KRISHNA:  With your mind intent on me, Arjuna, discipline yourself with the practice of yoga. Depend on me completely. Listen, and I will dispel all your doubts; you will come to know me fully and be united with me. \",\" I will give you both jnana and vijnana. When both these are realized, there is nothing more you need to know. \",\"  One person in many thousands may seek perfection, yet of these only a few reach the goal and come to realize me. \",\" Earth, water, fire, air, akasha, mind, intellect, and ego  these are the eight divisions of my prakriti. \",\" But beyond this I have another, higher nature, Arjuna; it supports the whole universe and is the source of life in all beings. \",\"  In these two aspects of my nature is the womb of all creation. The birth and dissolution of the cosmos itself take place in me. \",\" There is nothing that exists separate from me, Arjuna. The entire universe is suspended from me as my necklace of jewels. \",\"  Arjuna, I am the taste of pure water and the radiance of the sun and moon. I am the sacred word and the sound heard in air, and the courage of human beings. \",\" I am the sweet fragrance in the earth and the radiance of fire; I am the life in every creature and the striving of the spiritual aspirant. \",\"  My eternal seed, Arjuna, is to be found in every creature. I am the power of discrimination in those who are intelligent, and the glory   of the noble. \",\" In those who are strong, I am strength, free from passion and selfish attachment. I am desire itself, if that desire is in harmony with the purpose of life. \",\". The states of sattva, rajas, and tamas come from me, but I am not in them. \",\" These three gunas deceive the world: people fail to look beyond them to me, supreme and imperishable. \",\" The three gunas make up my divine maya, difficult to overcome. But they cross over this maya who take refuge in me. \",\" Others are deluded by maya; performing evil deeds, they have no devotion to me. Having lost all discrimination, they follow the way of their lower nature. \",\"  Good people come to worship me for different reasons. Some come to the spiritual life because of suffering, some in order to understand life; some come through a desire to achieve lifes purpose, and some come who are men and women of wisdom. \",\" Unwavering in devotion, always united with me, the man or woman of wisdom surpasses all the others. To them I am the dearest beloved, and they are very dear to me. \",\" All those who follow the spiritual path are blessed. But the wise who are always established in union, for whom there is no higher goal than me, may be regarded as my very Self. \",\"  After many births the wise seek refuge in me, seeing me everywhere and in everything. Such great souls are very rare. \",\" There are others whose discrimination is misled by many desires. Following their own nature, they worship lower gods, practicing various rites. \",\"  When a person is devoted to something with complete faith, I unify his faith in that. \",\" Then, when faith is completely unified, one gains the object of devotion. In this way, every desire is fulfilled by me. \",\" Those whose understanding is small attain only transient satisfaction: those who worship the gods go to the gods. But my devotees come to me. \",\"  Through lack of understanding, people believe that I, the Unmanifest, have entered into some form. They fail to realize my true nature, which transcends birth and death. \",\" Few see through the veil of maya. The world, deluded, does not know that I am without birth and changeless. \",\" I know everything about the past, the present, and the future, Arjuna; but there is no one who knows me completely. \",\" Delusion arises from the duality of attraction and aversion, Arjuna; every creature is deluded by these from birth. \",\" But those who have freed themselves from all wrongdoing are firmly established in worship of me. Their actions are pure, and they are free from the delusion caused by the pairs of opposites. \",\"  Those who take refuge in me, striving for liberation from old age and death, come to know Brahman, the Self, and the nature of all action. \",\" Those who see me ruling the cosmos, who see me in the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva, and the adhiyajna, are conscious of me even at the time of death.\",\" ARJUNA:  O Krishna, what is Brahman, and what is the nature of action? What is the adhyatma, the adhibhuta, the adhidaiva? \",\" What is the adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, and how is it to be offered? How are the self-controlled united with you at the time of death? \",\"  KRISHNA:  My highest nature, the imperishable Brahman, gives every creature its existence and lives in every creature as the adhyatma. My action is creation and the bringing forth of creatures. \",\" The adhibhuta is the perishable body; the adhidaiva is Purusha, eternal spirit. The adhiyajna, the supreme sacrifice, is made to me as the Lord within you. \",\"  Those who remember me at the time of death will come to me. Do not doubt this. \",\" Whatever occupies the mind at the time of death determines the destination of the dying; always they will tend toward that state of being. \",\" Therefore, remember me at all times and fight on. With your heart and mind intent on me, you will surely come to me. \",\" When you make your mind one-pointed through regular practice of meditation, you will find the supreme glory of the Lord. \",\" The Lord is the supreme poet, the first cause, the sovereign ruler, subtler than the tiniest particle, the support of all, inconceivable, bright as the sun, beyond darkness. \",\" Remembering him in this way at the time of death, through devotion and the power of meditation, with your mind completely stilled and your concentration fixed in the center of spiritual awareness between the eyebrows, you will realize the supreme Lord. \",\" I will tell you briefly of the eternal state all scriptures affirm, which can be entered only by those who are self-controlled and free from selfish passions. Those whose lives are dedicated to Brahman attain this supreme goal. \",\"  Remembering me at the time of death, close down the doors of the senses and place the mind in the heart. Then, while absorbed in meditation, focus all energy upwards to the head. \",\" Repeating in this state the divine name, the syllable Om that represents the changeless Brahman, you will go forth from the body and attain the supreme goal. \",\"  I am easily attained by the person who always remembers me and is attached to nothing else. Such a person is a true yogi, Arjuna. \",\" Great souls make their lives perfect and discover me; they are freed from mortality and the suffering of this separate existence. \",\" Every creature in the universe is subject to rebirth, Arjuna, except the one who is united with me. \",\"  Those who understand the cosmic laws know that the Day of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas and the Night of Brahma ends after a thousand yugas. \",\" When the day of Brahma dawns, forms are brought forth from the Unmanifest; when the night of Brahma comes, these forms merge in the Formless again. \",\" This multitude of beings is created and destroyed again and again in the succeeding days and nights of Brahma. \",\" But beyond this formless state there is another, unmanifested reality, which is eternal and is not dissolved when the cosmos is destroyed. \",\" Those who realize lifes supreme goal know that I am unmanifested and unchanging. Having come home to me, they never return to separate existence. \",\" This supreme Lord who pervades all existence, the true Self of all creatures, may be realized through undivided love. \",\" There are two paths, Arjuna, which the soul may follow at the time of death. One leads to rebirth and the other to liberation. \",\" The six months of the northern path of the sun, the path of light, of fire, of day, of the bright fortnight, leads knowers of Brahman to the supreme goal. \",\" The six months of the southern path of the sun, the path of smoke, of night, of the dark fortnight, leads other souls to the light of the moon and to rebirth. \",\"  These two paths, the light and the dark, are said to be eternal, leading some to liberation and others to rebirth. \",\" Once you have known these two paths, Arjuna, you can never be deluded again. Attain this knowledge through perseverance in yoga. \",\" There is merit in studying the scriptures, in selfless service, austerity, and giving, but the practice of meditation carries you beyond all these to the supreme abode of the highest Lord. \",\" KRISHNA:  Because of your faith, I shall tell you the most profound of secrets: obtaining both jnana and vijnana, you will be free from all evil. \",\" This royal knowledge, this royal secret, is the greatest purifier. Righteous and imperishable, it is a joy to practice and can be directly experienced. \",\" But those who have no faith in the supreme law of life do not find me, Arjuna. They return to the world, passing from death to death. \",\"  I pervade the entire universe in my unmanifested form. All creatures find their existence in me, but I am not limited by them. \",\" Behold my divine mystery! These creatures do not really dwell in me, and though I bring them forth and support them, I am not confined within them. \",\" They move in me as the winds move in every direction in space. \",\"  At the end of the eon these creatures return to unmanifested matter; at the beginning of the next cycle I send them forth again. \",\" Controlling my prakriti, again and again I bring forth these myriad forms and subject them to the laws of prakriti. \",\" None of these actions binds me, Arjuna. I am unattached to them, so they do not disturb my nature. \",\"  Under my watchful eye the laws of nature take their course. Thus is the world set in motion; thus the animate and the inanimate are created. \",\" The immature do not look beyond physical appearances to see my true nature as the Lord of all creation. \",\" The knowledge of such deluded people is empty; their lives are fraught with disaster and evil, and their work and hopes are all in vain. \",\"  But truly great souls seek my divine nature. They worship me with a one-pointed mind, having realized that I am the eternal source of all. \",\" Constantly striving, they make firm their resolve and worship me without wavering. Full of devotion, they sing of my divine glory. \",\"  Others follow the path of jnana, spiritual wisdom. They see that where there is One, that One is me; where there are many, all are me; they see my face everywhere. \",\"  I am the ritual and the sacrifice; I am true medicine and the mantram. I am the offering and the fire which consumes it, and the one to whom it is offered. \",\"  I am the father and mother of this universe, and its grandfather too; I am its entire support. I am the sum of all knowledge, the purifier, the syllable Om; I am the sacred scriptures, the Rig, Yajur, and Sama Vedas. \",\"  I am the goal of life, the Lord and support of all, the inner witness, the abode of all. I am the only refuge, the one true friend; I am the beginning, the staying, and the end of creation; I am the womb and the eternal seed. \",\"  I am heat; I give and withhold the rain. I am immortality and I am death; I am what is and what is not. \",\"  Those who follow the rituals given in the Vedas, who offer sacrifices and take soma, free themselves from evil and attain the vast heaven of the gods, where they enjoy celestial pleasures. \",\" When they have enjoyed these fully, their merit is exhausted and they return to this land of death. Thus observing Vedic rituals but caught in an endless chain of desires, they come and go. \",\"  Those who worship me and meditate on me constantly, without any other thought  I will provide for all their needs. \",\"  Those who worship other gods with faith and devotion also worship me, Arjuna, even if they do not observe the usual forms. \",\" I am the object of all worship, its enjoyer and Lord. But those who fail to realize my true nature must be reborn. \",\" Those who worship the devas will go to the realm of the devas; those who worship their ancestors will be united with them after death. Those who worship phantoms will become phantoms; but my devotees will come to me. \",\"  Whatever I am offered in devotion with a pure heart  a leaf, a flower, fruit, or water  I accept with joy. \",\" Whatever you do, make it an offering to me  the food you eat, the sacrifices you make, the help you give, even your suffering. \",\" In this way you will be freed from the bondage of karma, and from its results both pleasant and painful. Then, firm in renunciation and yoga, with your heart free, you will come to me. \",\"  I look upon all creatures equally; none are less dear to me and none more dear. But those who worship me with love live in me, and I come to life in them. \",\"  Even sinners become holy when they take refuge in me alone. \",\" Quickly their souls conform to dharma and they attain to boundless peace. Never forget this, Arjuna: no one who is devoted to me will ever come to harm. \",\"  All those who take refuge in me, whatever their birth, race, sex, or caste, will attain the supreme goal; this realization can be attained even by those whom society scorns. \",\" Kings and sages too seek this goal with devotion. Therefore, having been born in this transient and forlorn world, give all your love to me. \",\" Fill your mind with me; love me; serve me; worship me always. Seeking me in your heart, you will at last be united with me. \",\" KRISHNA:  Listen further, Arjuna, to my supreme teaching, which gives you such joy. Desiring your welfare, O strong-armed warrior, I will tell you more. \",\"  Neither gods nor sages know my origin, for I am the source from which the gods and sages come. \",\" Whoever knows me as the Lord of all creation, without birth or beginning, knows the truth and frees himself from all evil. \",\"  Discrimination, wisdom, understanding, forgiveness, truth, selfcontrol, and peace of mind; pleasure and pain, birth and death, fear and courage, honor and dishonor; \",\" nonviolence, charity, equanimity, contentment, and perseverance in spiritual disciplines  all the different qualities found in living creatures have their source in me. \",\"  The seven great sages and the four ancient ancestors were born from my mind and received my power. From them came all the creatures of this world. \",\" Whoever understands my power and the mystery of my manifestations comes without doubt to be united with me. \",\"  I am the source from which all creatures evolve. The wise remember this and worship me with loving devotion. \",\" Their thoughts are all absorbed in me, and all their vitality flows to me. Teaching one another, talking about me always, they are happy and fulfilled. \",\"  To those steadfast in love and devotion I give spiritual wisdom, so that they may come to me. \",\" Out of compassion I destroy the darkness of their ignorance. From within them I light the lamp of wisdom and dispel all darkness from their lives. \",\"  ARJUNA:  You are Brahman supreme, the highest abode, the supreme purifier, the self-luminous, eternal spirit, first among the gods, unborn and infinite. \",\" The great sages and seers  Narada, Asita, Devala, and Vyasa too  have acclaimed you thus; now you have declared it to me yourself. \",\"  Now, O Krishna, I believe that everything you have told me is divine truth. O Lord, neither gods nor demons know your real nature. \",\" Indeed, you alone know yourself, O supreme spirit. You are the source of being and the master of every creature, God of gods, the Lord of the universe. \",\"  Tell me all your divine attributes, leaving nothing unsaid. Tell me of the glories with which you fill the cosmos. \",\" Krishna, you are a supreme master of yoga. Tell me how I should meditate to gain constant awareness of you. In what things and in what ways should I meditate on you? \",\" O Krishna, you who stir up peoples hearts, tell me in detail your attributes and your powers; I can never tire of hearing your immortal words. \",\"  KRISHNA:  All right, Arjuna, I will tell you of my divine powers. I will mention only the most glorious; for there is no end to them. \",\"  I am the true Self in the heart of every creature, Arjuna, and the beginning, middle, and end of their existence. \",\"  Among the shining gods I am Vishnu; of luminaries I am the sun; among the storm gods I am Marichi, and in the night sky I am the moon. \",\"  Among scriptures I am the Sama Veda, and among the lesser gods I am Indra. Among the senses I am the mind, and in living beings I am consciousness. \",\"  Among the Rudras I am Shankara. Among the spirits of the natural world I am Kubera, god of wealth, and Pavaka, the purifying fire. Among mountains I am Meru. \",\"  Among priests I am Brihaspati, and among military leaders I am Skanda. Among bodies of water I am the ocean. \",\"  Among the great seers I am Bhrigu, and among words, the syllable Om; I am the repetition of the holy name, and among mountains I am the Himalayas. \",\"  Among trees I am the ashvattha, the sacred fig; among the gandharvas, the heavenly musicians, I am Chitraratha. Among divine seers I am Narada, and among sages I am Kapila. \",\"  I was born from the nectar of immortality as the primordial horse and as Indras noble elephant. Among human beings, I am the king. \",\"  Among weapons I am the thunderbolt. I am Kamadhuk, the cow that fulfills all desires; I am Kandarpa, the power of sex, and Vasuki, the king of snakes. \",\"  I am Ananta, the cosmic serpent, and Varuna, the god of water; I am Aryaman among the noble ancestors. Among the forces which restrain I am Yama, the god of death. \",\"  Among animals I am the lion; among birds, the eagle Garuda. I am Prahlada, born among the demons, and of all that measures, I am time. \",\"  Among purifying forces I am the wind; among warriors, Rama. Of water creatures I am the crocodile, and of rivers I am the Ganges. \",\"  I am the beginning, middle, and end of creation. Of all the sciences I am the science of Self-knowledge, and I am logic in those who debate. \",\" Among letters I am A; among grammatical compounds I am the dvandva. I am infinite time, and the sustainer whose face is seen everywhere. \",\"  I am death, which overcomes all, and the source of all beings still to be born. I am the feminine qualities: fame, beauty, perfect speech, memory, intelligence, loyalty, and forgiveness. \",\"  Among the hymns of the Sama Veda I am the Brihat; among poetic meters, the Gayatri. Among months I am Margashirsha, first of the year; among seasons I am spring, that brings forth flowers. \",\"  I am the gambling of the gambler and the radiance in all that shines. I am effort, I am victory, and I am the goodness of the virtuous. \",\"  Among the Vrishnis I am Krishna, and among the Pandavas I am Arjuna. Among sages I am Vyasa, and among poets, Ushanas. \",\"  I am the scepter which metes out punishment, and the art of statesmanship in those who lead. I am the silence of the unknown and the wisdom of the wise. \",\"  I am the seed that can be found in every creature, Arjuna; for without me nothing can exist, neither animate nor inanimate. \",\"  But there is no end to my divine attributes, Arjuna; these I have mentioned are only a few. \",\" Wherever you find strength, or beauty, or spiritual power, you may be sure that these have sprung from a spark of my essence. \",\"  But of what use is it to you to know all this, Arjuna? Just remember that I am, and that I support the entire cosmos with only a fragment of my being.\",\" ARJUNA:  Out of compassion you have taught me the supreme mystery of the Self. Through your words my delusion is gone. \",\" You have explained the origin and end of every creature, O lotus-eyed one, and told me of your own supreme, limitless existence. \",\"  Just as you have described your infinite glory, O Lord, now I long to see it. I want to see you as the supreme ruler of creation. \",\" O Lord, master of yoga, if you think me strong enough to behold it, show me your immortal Self. \",\"  KRISHNA:  Behold, Arjuna, a million divine forms, with an infinite variety of color and shape. \",\" Behold the gods of the natural world, and many more wonders never revealed before. \",\" Behold the entire cosmos turning within my body, and the other things you desire to see. \",\"  But these things cannot be seen with your physical eyes; therefore I give you spiritual vision to perceive my majestic power. \",\"  SANJAYA:  Having spoken these words, Krishna, the master of yoga, revealed to Arjuna his most exalted, lordly form. \",\"  He appeared with an infinite number of faces, ornamented by heavenly jewels, displaying unending miracles and the countless weapons of his power. \",\" Clothed in celestial garments and covered with garlands, sweet-smelling with heavenly fragrances, he showed himself as the infinite Lord, the source of all wonders, whose face is everywhere. \",\" If a thousand suns were to rise in the heavens at the same time, the blaze of their light would resemble the splendor of that supreme spirit. \",\"  There, within the body of the God of gods, Arjuna saw all the manifold forms of the universe united as one. \",\" Filled with amazement, his hair standing on end in ecstasy, he bowed before the Lord with joined palms and spoke these words. \",\"  ARJUNA  O Lord, I see within your body all the gods and every kind of living creature. I see Brahma, the Creator, seated on a lotus; I see the ancient sages and the celestial serpents. \",\"  I see infinite mouths and arms, stomachs and eyes, and you are embodied in every form. I see you everywhere, without beginning, middle, or end. You are the Lord of all creation, and the cosmos is your body. \",\"  You wear a crown and carry a mace and discus; your radiance is blinding and immeasurable. I see you, who are so difficult to behold, shining like a fiery sun blazing in every direction. \",\"  You are the supreme, changeless Reality, the one thing to be known. You are the refuge of all creation, the immortal spirit, the eternal guardian of eternal dharma. \",\"  You are without beginning, middle, or end; you touch everything with your infinite power. The sun and moon are your eyes, and your mouth is fire; your radiance warms the cosmos. \",\"  O Lord, your presence fills the heavens and the earth and reaches in every direction. I see the three worlds trembling before this vision of your wonderful and terrible form. \",\"  The gods enter your being, some calling out and greeting you in fear. Great saints sing your glory, praying, May all be well! \",\"  The multitudes of gods, demigods, and demons are all overwhelmed by the sight of you. \",\" O mighty Lord, at the sight of your myriad eyes and mouths, arms and legs, stomachs and fearful teeth, I and the entire universe shake in terror. \",\"  O Vishnu, I can see your eyes shining; with open mouth, you glitter in an array of colors, and your body touches the sky. I look at you and my heart trembles; I have lost all courage and all peace of mind. \",\"  When I see your mouths with their fearful teeth, mouths burning like the fires at the end of time, I forget where I am and I have no place to go. O Lord, you are the support of the universe; have mercy on me! \",\"  I see all the sons of Dhritarashtra; I see Bhishma, Drona, and Karna; I see our warriors and all the kings who are here to fight. \",\" All are rushing into your awful jaws; I see some of them crushed by your teeth. \",\" As rivers flow into the ocean, all the warriors of this world are passing into your fiery jaws; \",\" all creatures rush to their destruction like moths into a flame. \",\"  You lap the worlds into your burning mouths and swallow them. Filled with your terrible radiance, O Vishnu, the whole of creation bursts into flames. \",\"  Tell me who you are, O Lord of terrible form. I bow before you; have mercy! I want to know who you are, you who existed before all creation. Your nature and workings confound me. \",\"  KRISHNA:  I am time, the destroyer of all; I have come to consume the world. Even without your participation, all the warriors gathered here will die. \",\"  Therefore arise, Arjuna; conquer your enemies and enjoy the glory of sovereignty. I have already slain all these warriors; you will only be my instrument. \",\"  Bhishma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna, and many others are already slain. Kill those whom I have killed. Do not hesitate. Fight in this battle and you will conquer your enemies. \",\"  SANJAYA:  Having heard these words, Arjuna trembled in fear. With joined palms he bowed before Krishna and addressed him stammering. \",\"  ARJUNA:  O Krishna, it is right that the world delights and rejoices in your praise, that all the saints and sages bow down to you and all evil flees before you to the far corners of the universe. \",\"  How could they not worship you, O Lord? You are the eternal spirit, who existed before Brahma the Creator and who will never cease to be. Lord of the gods, you are the abode of the universe. Changeless, you are what is and what is not, and beyond the duality of existence and nonexistence. \",\"  You are the first among the gods, the timeless spirit, the resting place of all beings. You are the knower and the thing which is known. You are the final home; with your infinite form you pervade the cosmos. \",\"  You are Vayu, god of wind; Yama, god of death; Agni, god of fire; Varuna, god of water. You are the moon and the creator Prajapati, and the great-grandfather of all creatures. I bow before you and salute you again and again. \",\"  You are behind me and in front of me; I bow to you on every side. Your power is immeasurable. You pervade everything; you are everything. \",\"  Sometimes, because we were friends, I rashly said, Oh, Krishna! Say, friend!  casual, careless remarks. Whatever I may have said lightly, whether we were playing or resting, alone or in company, sitting together or eating, \",\" if it was disrespectful, forgive me for it, O Krishna. I did not know the greatness of your nature, unchanging and imperishable. \",\"  You are the father of the universe, of the animate and the inanimate; you are the object of all worship, the greatest guru. There is none to equal you in the three worlds. Who can match your power? \",\" O gracious Lord, I prostrate myself before you and ask for your blessing. As a father forgives his son, or a friend a friend, or a lover his beloved, so should you forgive me. \",\"  I rejoice in seeing you as you have never been seen before, yet I am filled with fear by this vision of you as the abode of the universe. Please let me see you again as the shining God of gods. \",\" Though you are the embodiment of all creation, let me see you again not with a thousand arms but with four, carrying the mace and discus and wearing a crown. \",\"  KRISHNA:  Arjuna, through my grace you have been united with me and received this vision of my radiant, universal form, without beginning or end, which no one else has ever seen. \",\"  Not by knowledge of the Vedas, nor sacrifice, nor charity, nor rituals, nor even by severe asceticism has any other mortal seen what you have seen, O heroic Arjuna. \",\"  Do not be troubled; do not fear my terrible form. Let your heart be satisfied and your fears dispelled in looking at me as I was before. \",\"  SANJAYA:  Having spoken these words, the Lord once again assumed the gentle form of Krishna and consoled his devotee, who had been so afraid. \",\" ARJUNA:  O Krishna, now that I have seen your gentle human form my mind is again composed and returned to normal. \",\"  KRISHNA:  It is extremely difficult to obtain the vision you have had; even the gods long always to see me in this aspect. \",\" Neither knowledge of the Vedas, nor austerity, nor charity, nor sacrifice can bring the vision you have seen. \",\" But through unfailing devotion, Arjuna, you can know me, see me, and attain union with me. \",\" Those who make me the supreme goal of all their work and act without selfish attachment, who devote themselves to me completely and are free from ill will for any creature, enter into me.  \",\" ARJUNA  Of those steadfast devotees who love you and those who seek you as the eternal formless Reality, who are the more established in yoga? \",\"  KRISHNA:  Those who set their hearts on me and worship me with unfailing devotion and faith are more established in yoga. \",\"  As for those who seek the transcendental Reality, without name, without form, contemplating the Unmanifested, beyond the reach of thought and of feeling, \",\" with their senses subdued and mind serene and striving for the good of all beings, they too will verily come unto me. \",\"  Yet hazardous and slow is the path to the Unrevealed, difficult for physical creatures to tread. \",\" But they for whom I am the supreme goal, who do all work renouncing self for me and meditate on me with single-hearted devotion, \",\" these I will swiftly rescue from the fragments cycle of birth and death, for their consciousness has entered into me. \",\"  Still your mind in me, still your intellect in me, and without doubt you will be united with me forever. \",\" If you cannot still your mind in me, learn to do so through the regular practice of meditation. \",\" If you lack the will for such self-discipline, engage yourself in my work, for selfless service can lead you at last to complete fulfillment. \",\" If you are unable to do even this, surrender yourself to   me, disciplining yourself and renouncing the results of all your actions. \",\" Better indeed is knowledge than mechanical practice. Better than knowledge is meditation. But better still is surrender of attachment to results, because there follows immediate peace. \",\" That one I love who is incapable of ill will, who is friendly and compassionate. Living beyond the reach of I and mine and of pleasure and pain, \",\" patient, contented, self-controlled, firm in faith, with all their heart and all their mind given to me  with such as these I am in love. \",\"  Not agitating the world or by it agitated, they stand above the sway of elation, competition, and fear: that one is my beloved. \",\"  They are detached, pure, efficient, impartial, never anxious, selfless in all their undertakings; they are my devotees, very dear to me. \",\"  That one is dear to me who runs not after the pleasant or away from the painful, grieves not, lusts not, but lets things come and go as they happen. \",\"  That devotee who looks upon friend and foe with equal regard, who is not buoyed up by praise nor cast down by blame, alike in heat and cold, pleasure and pain, free from selfish attachments, \",\" the same in honor and dishonor, quiet, ever full, in harmony everywhere, firm in faith  such a one is dear to me. \",\"  Those who meditate upon this immortal dharma as I have declared it, full of faith and seeking me as lifes supreme goal, are truly my devotees, and my love for them is very great. \",\" KRISHNA  The body is called a field, Arjuna; the one who knows it is called the Knower of the field. This is the knowledge of those who know. \",\" I am the Knower of the field in everyone, Arjuna. Knowledge of the field and its Knower is true knowledge. \",\"  Listen and I will explain the nature of the field and how change takes place within it. I will also describe the Knower of the field and his power. \",\" These truths have been sung by great sages in a variety of ways, and expounded in precise arguments concerning Brahman. \",\"  The field, Arjuna, is made up of the following: the five areas of sense perception; the five elements; the five sense organs and the five organs of action; the three components of the mind: manas, buddhi, and ahamkara; and the undifferentiated energy from which all these evolved. \",\" In this field arise desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the body, intelligence, and will. \",\"  Those who know truly are free from pride and deceit. They are gentle, forgiving, upright, and pure, devoted to their spiritual teacher, filled with inner strength, and self-controlled. \",\" Detached from sense objects and self-will, they have learned the painful lesson of separate birth and suffering, old age, disease, and death. \",\"  Free from selfish attachment, they do not get compulsively entangled even in home and family. They are even-minded through good fortune and bad. \",\" Their devotion to me is undivided. Enjoying solitude and not following the crowd, they seek only me. \",\"  This is true knowledge, to seek the Self as the true end of wisdom always. To seek anything else is ignorance. \",\"  I will tell you of the wisdom that leads to immortality: the beginningless Brahman, which can be called neither being nor nonbeing. \",\"  It dwells in all, in every hand and foot and head, in every mouth and eye and ear in the universe. \",\" Without senses itself, it shines through the functioning of the senses. Completely independent, it supports all things. Beyond the gunas, it enjoys their play. \",\"  It is both near and far, both within and without every creature; it moves and is unmoving. \",\" In its subtlety it is beyond comprehension. It is indivisible, yet appears divided in separate creatures. Know it to be the creator, the preserver, and the destroyer. \",\"  Dwelling in every heart, it is beyond darkness. It is called the light of light, the object and goal of knowledge, and knowledge itself. \",\"  I have revealed to you the nature of the field and the meaning and object of true knowledge. Those who are devoted to me, knowing these things, are united with me. \",\"  Know that prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning, and that from prakriti come the gunas and all that changes. \",\" Prakriti is the agent, cause, and effect of every action, but it is Purusha that seems to experience pleasure and pain. \",\"  Purusha, resting in prakriti, witnesses the play of the gunas born of prakriti. But attachment to the gunas leads a person to be born for good or evil. \",\"  Within the body the supreme Purusha is called the witness, approver, supporter, enjoyer, the supreme Lord, the highest Self. \",\"  Whoever realizes the true nature of Purusha, prakriti, and the gunas, whatever path he or she may follow, is not born separate again. \",\"  Some realize the Self within them through the practice of meditation, some by the path of wisdom, and others by selfless service. \",\" Others may not know these paths; but hearing and following the instructions of an illumined teacher, they too go beyond death. \",\"  Whatever exists, Arjuna, animate or inanimate, is born through the union of the field and its Knower. \",\"  They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. \",\" Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal. \",\"  They alone see truly who see that all actions are performed by prakriti, while the Self remains unmoved. \",\" When they see the variety of creation rooted in that unity and growing out of it, they attain fulfillment in Brahman. \",\"  This supreme Self is without a beginning, undifferentiated, deathless. Though it dwells in the body, Arjuna, it neither acts nor is touched by action. \",\" As akasha pervades the cosmos but remains unstained, the Self can never be tainted though it dwells in every creature. \",\"  As the sun lights up the world, the Self dwelling in the field is the source of all light in the field. \",\" Those who, with the eye of wisdom, distinguish the field from its Knower and the way to freedom from the bondage of prakriti, attain the supreme goal.   \",\" KRISHNA:  Let me tell you more about the wisdom that transcends all knowledge, through which the saints and sages attained perfection. \",\" Those who rely on this wisdom will be united with me. For them there is neither rebirth nor fear of death. \",\"  My womb is prakriti; in that I place the seed. Thus all created things are born. \",\" Everything born, Arjuna, comes from the womb of prakriti, and I am the seed-giving father. \",\"  It is the three gunas born of prakriti  sattva, rajas, and tamas  that bind the immortal Self to the body. \",\" Sattva  pure, luminous, and free from sorrow  binds us with attachment to happiness and wisdom. \",\" Rajas is passion, arising from selfish desire and attachment. These bind the Self with compulsive action. \",\" Tamas, born of ignorance, deludes all creatures through heedlessness, indolence, and sleep. \",\"  Sattva binds us to happiness; rajas binds us to action. Tamas, distorting our understanding, binds us to delusion. \",\"  Sattva predominates when rajas and tamas are transformed. Rajas prevails when sattva is weak and tamas overcome. Tamas prevails when rajas and sattva are dormant. \",\"  When sattva predominates, the light of wisdom shines through every gate of the body. \",\" When rajas predominates, a person runs about pursuing selfish and greedy ends, driven by restlessness and desire. \",\" When tamas is dominant a person lives in darkness  slothful, confused, and easily infatuated. \",\" Those dying in the state of sattva attain the pure worlds of the wise. \",\" Those dying in rajas are reborn among people driven by work. But those who die in tamas are conceived in the wombs of the ignorant. \",\"  The fruit of good deeds is pure and sattvic. The fruit of rajas is suffering. The fruit of tamas is ignorance and insensitivity. \",\"  From sattva comes understanding; from rajas, greed. But the outcome of tamas is confusion, infatuation, and ignorance. \",\"  Those who live in sattva go upwards; those in rajas remain where they are. But those immersed in tamas sink downwards. \",\"  The wise see clearly that all action is the work of the gunas. Knowing that which is above the gunas, they enter into union with me. \",\"  Going beyond the three gunas which form the body, they leave behind the cycle of birth and death, decrepitude and sorrow, and attain to immortality. \",\"  ARJUNA:  What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the gunas, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the gunas hold? \",\"  KRISHNA:  They are unmoved by the harmony of sattva, the activity of rajas, or the delusion of tamas. They feel no aversion when these forces are active, nor do they crave for them when these forces subside. \",\"  They remain impartial, undisturbed by the actions of the gunas. Knowing that it is the gunas which act, they abide within themselves and do not vacillate. \",\" Established within themselves, they are equal in pleasure and pain, praise and blame, kindness and unkindness. Clay, a rock, and gold are the same to them. \",\" Alike in honor and dishonor, alike to friend and foe, they have given up every selfish pursuit. Such are those who have gone beyond the gunas. \",\"  By serving me with steadfast love, a man or woman goes beyond the gunas. Such a one is fit for union with Brahman. \",\" For I am the support of Brahman, the eternal, the unchanging, the deathless, the everlasting dharma, the source of all joy. \",\" KRISHNA  Sages speak of the immutable ashvattha tree, with its taproot above and its branches below. On this tree grow the scriptures; seeing their source, one knows their essence. \",\"  Nourished by the gunas, the limbs of this tree spread above and below. Sense objects grow on the limbs as buds; the roots hanging down bind us to action in this world. \",\"  The true form of this tree  its essence, beginning, and end  is not perceived on this earth. Cut down this strong-rooted tree with the sharp axe of detachment; \",\" then find the path which does not come back again. Seek That, the First Cause, from which the universe came long ago. \",\"  Not deluded by pride, free from selfish attachment and selfish desire, beyond the duality of pleasure and pain, ever aware of the Self, the wise go forward to that eternal goal. \",\" Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire can add to that light. This is my supreme abode, and those who enter there do not return to separate existence. \",\"  An eternal part of me enters into the world, assuming the powers of action and perception and a mind made of prakriti. \",\" When the divine Self enters and leaves a body, it takes these along as the wind carries a scent from place to place. \",\" Using the mind, ears, eyes, nose, and the senses of taste and touch, the Self enjoys sense objects. \",\" The deluded do not see the Self when it leaves the body or when it dwells within it. They do not see the Self enjoying sense objects or acting through the gunas. But they who have the eye of wisdom see. \",\"  Those who strive resolutely on the path of yoga see the Self within. The thoughtless, who strive imperfectly, do not. \",\"  The brightness of the sun, which lights up the world, the brightness of the moon and of fire  these are my glory. \",\" With a drop of my energy I enter the earth and support all creatures. Through the moon, the vessel of life-giving fluid, I nourish all plants. \",\" I enter breathing creatures and dwell within as the lifegiving breath. I am the fire in the stomach which digests all food. \",\"  Entering into every heart, I give the power to remember and understand; it is I again who take that power away. All the scriptures lead to me; I am their author and their wisdom. \",\"  In this world there are two orders of being: the perishable, separate creature and the changeless spirit. \",\" But beyond these there is another, the supreme Self, the eternal Lord, who enters into the entire cosmos and supports it from within. \",\"  I am that supreme Self, praised by the scriptures as beyond the changing and the changeless. \",\" Those who see in me that supreme Self see truly. They have found the source of all wisdom, Arjuna, and they worship me with all their heart. \",\"  I have shared this profound truth with you, Arjuna. Those who understand it will attain wisdom; they will have done that which has to be done.  \",\" KRISHNA:  Be fearless and pure; never waver in your determination or your dedication to the spiritual life. Give freely. Be self-controlled, sincere, truthful, loving, and full of the desire to serve. Realize the truth of the scriptures; learn to be detached and to take joy in renunciation. \",\" Do not get angry or harm any living creature, but be compassionate and gentle; show good will to all. \",\" Cultivate vigor, patience, will, purity; avoid malice and pride. Then, Arjuna, you will achieve your divine destiny. \",\"  Other qualities, Arjuna, make a person more and more inhuman: hypocrisy, arrogance, conceit, anger, cruelty, ignorance. \",\"  The divine qualities lead to freedom; the demonic, to bondage. But do not grieve, Arjuna; you were born with divine attributes. \",\"  Some people have divine tendencies, others demonic. I have described the divine at length, Arjuna; now listen while I describe the demonic. \",\"  The demonic do things they should avoid and avoid the things they should do. They have no sense of uprightness, purity, or truth. \",\"  There is no God, they say, no truth, no spiritual law, no moral order. The basis of life is sex; what else can it be? \",\" Holding such distorted views, possessing scant discrimination, they become enemies of the world, causing suffering and destruction. \",\"  Hypocritical, proud, and arrogant, living in delusion and clinging to deluded ideas, insatiable in their desires, they pursue their unclean ends. \",\" Although burdened with fears that end only with death, they still maintain with complete assurance, Gratification of lust is the highest that life can offer. \",\"  Bound on all sides by scheming and anxiety, driven by anger and greed, they amass by any means they can a hoard of money for the satisfaction of their cravings. \",\"  I got this today, they say; tomorrow I shall get that. This wealth is mine, and that will be mine too. \",\" I have destroyed my enemies. I shall destroy others too! Am I not like God? I enjoy what I want. I am successful. I am powerful. I am happy. \",\" I am rich and well-born. Who is equal to me? I will perform sacrifices and give gifts, and rejoice in my own generosity. This is how they go on, deluded by ignorance. \",\" Bound by their greed and entangled in a web of delusion, whirled about by a fragmented mind, they fall into a dark hell. \",\"  Self-important, obstinate, swept away by the pride of wealth, they ostentatiously perform sacrifices without any regard for their purpose. \",\" Egotistical, violent, arrogant, lustful, angry, envious of everyone, they abuse my presence within their own bodies and in the bodies of others. \",\"  Life after life I cast those who are malicious, hateful, cruel, and degraded into the wombs of those with similar demonic natures. \",\" Birth after birth they find themselves with demonic tendencies. Degraded in this way, Arjuna, they fail to reach me and fall lower still. \",\"  There are three gates to this self-destructive hell: lust, anger, and greed. Renounce these three. \",\" Those who escape from these three gates of darkness, Arjuna, seek what is best and attain lifes supreme goal. \",\" Others disregard the teachings of the scriptures. Driven by selfish desire, they miss the goal of life, miss even happiness and success. \",\"  Therefore let the scriptures be your guide in what to do and what not to do. Understand their teachings; then act in accordance with them. \",\" ARJUNA  O Krishna, what is the state of those who disregard the scriptures but still worship with faith? Do they act from sattva, rajas, or tamas? \",\"  KRISHNA  Every creature is born with faith of some kind, either sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. Listen, and I will describe each to you. \",\"  Our faith conforms to our nature, Arjuna. Human nature is made of faith. A person is what his shraddha is. \",\"  Those who are sattvic worship the forms of God; those who are rajasic worship power and wealth. Those who are tamasic worship spirits and ghosts. \",\" Some invent harsh penances. Motivated by hypocrisy and egotism, \",\" they torture their innocent bodies and me who dwells within. Blinded by their strength and passion, they act and think like demons. \",\"  The three kinds of faith express themselves in the habits of those who hold them: in the food they like, the work they do, the disciplines they practice, the gifts they give. Listen, and I will describe their different ways. \",\"  Sattvic people enjoy food that is mild, tasty, substantial, agreeable, and nourishing, food that promotes health, strength, cheerfulness, and longevity. \",\" Rajasic people like food that is salty or bitter, hot, sour, or spicy  food that promotes pain, discomfort, and disease. \",\" Tamasic people like overcooked, stale, leftover, and impure food, food that has lost its taste and nutritional value. \",\" The sattvic perform sacrifices with their entire mind fixed on the purpose of the sacrifice. Without thought of reward, they follow the teachings of the scriptures. \",\" The rajasic perform sacrifices for the sake of show and the good it will bring them. \",\" The tamasic perform sacrifices ignoring both the letter and the spirit. They omit the proper prayers, the proper offerings, the proper food, and the proper faith. \",\"  To offer service to the gods, to the good, to the wise, and to your spiritual teacher; purity, honesty, continence, and nonviolence: these are the disciplines of the body. \",\" To offer soothing words, to speak truly, kindly, and helpfully, and to study the scriptures: these are the disciplines of speech. \",\" Calmness, gentleness, silence, self-restraint, and purity: these are the disciplines of the mind. \",\"  When these three levels of self-discipline are practiced without attachment to the results, but in a spirit of great faith, the sages call this practice sattvic. \",\" Disciplines practiced in order to gain respect, honor, or admiration are rajasic; they are undependable and transitory in their effects. \",\" Disciplines practiced to gain power over others, or in the confused belief that to torture oneself is spiritual, are tamasic. \",\"  Giving simply because it is right to give, without thought of return, at a proper time, in proper circumstances, and to a worthy person, is sattvic giving. \",\" Giving with regrets or in the expectation of receiving some favor or of getting something in return is rajasic. \",\" Giving at an inappropriate time, in inappropriate circumstances, and to an unworthy person, without affection or respect, is tamasic. \",\"  Om Tat Sat: these three words represent Brahman, from which come priests and scriptures and sacrifice. \",\" Those who follow the Vedas, therefore, always repeat the word Om when offering sacrifices, performing spiritual disciplines, or giving gifts. \",\" Those seeking liberation and not any personal benefit add the word Tat when performing these acts of worship, discipline, and charity. \",\" Sat means that which is; it also indicates goodness. Therefore it is used to describe a worthy deed. \",\" To be steadfast in self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving is sat. To act in accordance with these three is sat as well. \",\" But to engage in sacrifice, self-discipline, and giving without good faith is asat, without worth or goodness, either in this life or in the next.   \",\" ARJUNA:  O Krishna, destroyer of evil, please explain to me sannyasa and tyaga and how one kind of renunciation differs from another. \",\"  KRISHNA:  To refrain from selfish acts is one kind of renunciation, called sannyasa; to renounce the fruit of action is another, called tyaga. \",\"  Among the wise, some say that all action should be renounced as evil. Others say that certain kinds of action  self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline  should be continued. \",\" Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain three kinds of tyaga and my conclusions concerning them. \",\"  Self-sacrifice, giving, and self-discipline should not be renounced, for they purify the thoughtful. \",\" Yet even these, Arjuna, should be performed without desire for selfish rewards. This is essential. \",\"  To renounce ones responsibilities is not fitting. The wise call such deluded renunciation tamasic. \",\" To avoid action from fear of difficulty or physical discomfort is rajasic. There is no reward in such renunciation. \",\" But to fulfill your responsibilities knowing that they are obligatory, while at the same time desiring nothing for yourself  this is sattvic renunciation. \",\" Those endowed with sattva clearly understand the meaning of renunciation and do not waver. They are not intimidated by unpleasant work, nor do they seek a job because it is pleasant. \",\"  As long as one has a body, one cannot renounce action altogether. True renunciation is giving up all desire for personal reward. \",\" Those who are attached to personal reward will reap the consequences of their actions: some pleasant, some unpleasant, some mixed. But those who renounce every desire for personal reward go beyond the reach of karma. \",\"  Listen, Arjuna, and I will explain the five elements necessary for the accomplishment of every action, as taught by the wisdom of Sankhya. \",\" The body, the means, the ego, the performance of the act, and the divine will: \",\" these are the five factors in all actions, right or wrong, in thought, word, or deed. \",\"  Those who do not understand this think of themselves as separate agents. With their crude intellects they fail to see the truth. \",\" The person who is free from ego, who has attained purity of heart, though he slays these people, he does not slay and is not bound by his action. \",\"  Knowledge, the thing to be known, and the knower: these three promote action. The means, the act itself, and the doer: these three are the totality of action. \",\" Knowledge, action, and the doer can be described according to the gunas. Listen, and I will explain their distinctions to you. \",\"  Sattvic knowledge sees the one indestructible Being in all beings, the unity underlying the multiplicity of creation. \",\" Rajasic knowledge sees all things and creatures as separate and distinct. \",\" Tamasic knowledge, lacking any sense of perspective, sees one small part and mistakes it for the whole. \",\"  Work performed to fulfill ones obligations, without thought of personal reward or of whether the job is pleasant or unpleasant, is sattvic. \",\" Work prompted by selfish desire or self-will, full of stress, is rajasic. \",\" Work that is undertaken blindly, without any consideration of consequences, waste, injury to others, or ones own capacities, is tamasic. \",\"  Sattvic workers are free from egotism and selfish attachments, full of enthusiasm and fortitude in success and failure alike. \",\" Rajasic workers have strong personal desires and crave rewards for their actions. Covetous, impure, and destructive, they are easily swept away by fortune, good or bad. \",\" Tamasic workers are undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, dishonest, and lazy. They are easily depressed and prone to procrastination. \",\"  Listen, Arjuna, as I describe the three types of understanding and will. \",\"  To know when to act and when to refrain from action, what is right action and what is wrong, what brings security and what insecurity, what brings freedom and what bondage: these are the signs of a sattvic intellect. \",\"  The rajasic intellect confuses right and wrong actions, and cannot distinguish what is to be done from what should not be done. \",\" The tamasic intellect is shrouded in darkness, utterly reversing right and wrong wherever it turns. \",\"  The sattvic will, developed through meditation, keeps prana, mind, and senses in vital harmony. \",\" The rajasic will, conditioned by selfish desire, pursues wealth, pleasure, and respectability. \",\" The tamasic will shows itself in obstinate ignorance, sloth, fear, grief, depression, and conceit. \",\"  Now listen, Arjuna: there are also three kinds of happiness. By sustained effort, one comes to the end of sorrow. \",\" That which seems like poison at first, but tastes like nectar in the end  this is the joy of sattva, born of a mind at peace with itself. \",\" Pleasure from the senses seems like nectar at first, but it is bitter as poison in the end. This is the kind of happiness that comes to the rajasic. \",\" Those who are tamasic draw their pleasures from sleep, indolence, and intoxication. Both in the beginning and in the end, this happiness is a delusion. \",\"  No creature, whether born on earth or among the gods in heaven, is free from the conditioning of the three gunas. \",\" The different responsibilities found in the social order  distinguishing brahmin, kshatriya, vaishya, and shudra  have their roots in this conditioning. \",\"  The responsibilities to which brahmins are born, based on their nature, are self-control, tranquility, purity of heart, patience, humility, learning, austerity, wisdom, and faith. \",\"  The qualities of kshatriyas, based on their nature, are courage, strength, fortitude, dexterity, generosity, leadership, and the firm resolve never to retreat from battle. \",\" The occupations suitable for a vaishya are agriculture, dairying, and trade. The proper work of a shudra is service. \",\"  By devotion to ones own particular duty, everyone can attain perfection. Let me tell you how. \",\" By performing ones own work, one worships the Creator who dwells in every creature. Such worship brings that person to fulfillment. \",\"  It is better to perform ones own duties imperfectly than to master the duties of another. By fulfilling the obligations he is born with, a person never comes to grief. \",\" No one should abandon duties because he sees defects in them. Every action, every activity, is surrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke. \",\"  One who is free from selfish attachments, who has mastered himself and his passions, attains the supreme perfection of freedom from action. \",\" Listen and I shall explain now, Arjuna, how one who has attained perfection also attains Brahman, the supreme consummation of wisdom. \",\"  Unerring in discrimination, sovereign of the senses and passions, free from the clamor of likes and dislikes, \",\" such a one leads a simple, self-reliant life based on meditation, controlling speech, body, and mind. \",\"  Free from self-will, aggressiveness, arrogance, anger, and the lust to possess people or things, they are at peace with themselves and others and enter into the unitive state. \",\" United with Brahman, ever joyful, beyond the reach of desire and sorrow, they have equal regard for every living creature and attain supreme devotion to me. \",\" By loving me they come to know me truly; then they know my glory and enter into my boundless being. \",\" All their acts are performed in my service, and through my grace they win eternal life. \",\"  Make every act an offering to me; regard me as your only protector. Relying on interior discipline, meditate on me always. \",\" Remembering me, you shall overcome all difficulties through my grace. But if you will not heed me in your self-will, nothing will avail you. \",\"  If you egotistically say, I will not fight this battle, your resolve will be useless; your own nature will drive you into it. \",\" Your own karma, born of your own nature, will drive you to do even that which you do not wish to do, because of your delusion. \",\"  The Lord dwells in the hearts of all creatures and whirls them round upon the wheel of maya. \",\" Run to him for refuge with all your strength, and peace profound will be yours through his grace. \",\"  I give you these precious words of wisdom; reflect on them and then do as you choose. \",\" These are the last words I shall speak to you, dear one, for your spiritual fulfillment. You are very dear to me. \",\"  Be aware of me always, adore me, make every act an offering to me, and you shall come to me; this I promise; for you are dear to me. \",\" Abandon all supports and look to me for protection. I shall purify you from the sins of the past; do not grieve. \",\"  Do not share this wisdom with anyone who lacks in devotion or self-control, lacks the desire to learn, or scoffs at me. \",\" Those who teach this supreme mystery of the Gita to all who love me perform the greatest act of love; they will come to me without doubt. \",\" No one can render me more devoted service; no one on earth can be more dear to me. \",\" Those who meditate on these holy words worship me with wisdom and devotion. \",\" Even those who listen to them with faith, free from doubts, will find a happier world where good people dwell. \",\"  Have you listened with attention? Are you now free from your doubts and confusion? \",\"  ARJUNA:  You have dispelled my doubts and delusions, and I understand through your grace. My faith is firm now, and I will do your will. \",\"  SANJAYA:  This is the dialogue I heard between Krishna, the son of Vasudeva, and Arjuna, the great-hearted son of Pritha. The wonder of it makes my hair stand on end! \",\" Through Vyasas grace, I have heard the supreme secret of spiritual union directly from the Lord of Yoga, Krishna himself. \",\"  Whenever I remember these wonderful, holy words between Krishna and Arjuna, I am filled with joy. \",\" And when I remember the breathtaking form of Krishna, I am filled with wonder and my joy overflows. \",\"  Wherever the divine Krishna and the mighty Arjuna are, there will be prosperity, victory, happiness, and sound judgment. Of this I am sure!  \",\"  If, O Krishna, you hold that the attitude of detachment is superior to  action, then why, O Krishna, do you urge me to dreadful action?    \",\"  You do seem to confuse my understanding with perplexing speech; tell  me, therefore, in no uncertain voice, that alone whereby I may attain salvation.   The Lord Said:   \",\"  I have spoken, before, O sinless one, of two attitudes in this world\\u2014the  Sankhayas', that of Jnana yoga and the Yogins', that of karma yoga.   \",\"  Never does man enjoy freedom from action by not undertaking action, nor  does he attain that freedom by mere renunciation of action.   \",\"  For none ever remains inactive even for a moment; for all are compelled to  action by the gunas inherent in prakriti.   \",\"  He who curbs the organs of action but allows the mind to dwell on the  sense-objects,\\u2014such a one, wholly deluded, is called a hypocrite.   \",\"  But he, O Arjuna, who keeping all the senses under control of the mind,  engages the organs in Karma yoga, without attachment\\u2014that man excels.   \",\"  Do you your allotted task; for action is superior to inaction; with inaction even  life's normal course is not possible.   \",\"  This world of men suffers bondage from all action save that which is done for  the sake of sacrifice; to this end, O Arjuna, perform action without  attachment.   \",\"  Together with sacrifice did the Lord of beings create, of old, mankind,  declaring:  \\\"By this shall you increase; may this be to you the giver of all your desires.   \",\"  \\\"With this may you cherish the gods and may the gods cherish you; thus  cherishing one another may you attain the highest good.   \",\"  \\\"Cherished with sacrifice, the gods will bestow on you the desired boons.\\\"  He who enjoys their gifts without rendering aught unto them is verily a thief.   \",\"  The righteous men who eat the residue of the sacrifice are freed from all sin,  but the wicked who cook for themselves eat sin.   \",\"  From food springs all life, from rain is born food; from sacrifice comes rain  and sacrifice is the result of action.   \",\"  Know that action springs from Brahman and Brahman from the  Imperishable; hence the all-pervading Brahman is ever firm-founded on  sacrifice.   \",\"  He who does not follow the wheel thus set in motion here below, he, living  in sin, sating his senses, lives, O Arjuna, in vain.   \",\"  But the man who revels in soul, who is content in soul and who is  satisfied only with soul, for him no action exists.   \",\"  He has no interest whatever in anything done, nor in anything not done, nor  has he need to rely on anything for personal ends.    \",\"  Therefore, do you ever perform without attachment the work that you  must do; for performing action without attachment man attains the Supreme.   \",\"  For through action alone Janaka and others achieved perfection; even with a  view to the guidance of mankind you must act.   \",\"  Whatever the best man does, is also done by other men, what example he  sets, the world follows.   \",\"  For me, O Arjuna, there is nothing to do in the three worlds, nothing worth  gaining that I have not gained; yet I am ever in action.   \",\"  Indeed, for were I not, unslumbering, ever to remain in action, O Arjuna,  men would follow my example in every way.   \",\"  If I were not to perform my task, these worlds would be ruined; I should be  the same cause of chaos and of the end of all mankind.   \",\"  Just as, with attachment, the unenlightened perform all actions, O Arjuna,  even so, but unattached, should the enlightened man act, with a desire for the  welfare of humanity.   \",\"  The enlightened may not confuse the mind of the unenlightened, who are  attached to action; rather must he perform all actions unattached, and thus  encourage them to do likewise.   \",\"  All action is entirely done by the gunas of prakriti. Man, deluded by the  sense of \\u2018I', thinks, \\u2018I am the doer'.    \",\"  But he, O Arjuna, who understands the truth of the various gunas and  their various activities, knows that it is the gunas that operate on the gunas; he  does not claim to be the doer.   \",\"  Deluded by the gunas of prakriti men become attached to the activities of  the gunas; he who knows the truth of things should not unhinge the  slow-witted who have not the knowledge.   \",\"  Cast all your acts on Me, with your mind fixed on the indwelling soul, and  without any thought of fruit, or sense of \\u2018mine' shake off your fever and fight!   \",\"  Those who always act according to the rule I have here laid down, in faith  and without cavilling\\u2014they too are released from the bondage of their actions.   \",\"  But those who cavil at the rule and refuse to conform to it are fools, dead to  all knowledge; know that they are lost.   \",\"  Even a man of knowledge acts according to his nature; all creatures follow  their nature; what then will constraint avail?   \",\"  Each sense has its settled likes and dislikes towards its objects; man should  not come under the sway of these, for they are his besetters.   \",\"  Better one's own duty, bereft of merit, than another's well-performed; better  is death in the discharge of one's duty; another's duty is fraught with danger.   Arjuna Said:   \",\"  Then what impels man to sin, O Krishna, even against his will, as though  by force compelled?  The Lord Said:   \",\"  It is Lust, it is Wrath, born of the guna\\u2014Rajas. It is the arch-devourer, the  arch-sinner. Know this to be man's enemy here.   \",\"  As fire is obscured by smoke, a mirror by dirt, and the embryo by the  amnion, so is knowledge obscured by this.   \",\"  Knowledge is obscured, O Arjuna, by this eternal enemy of the wise man,  in the form of Lust, the insatiable fire.   \",\"  The senses, the mind and the reason are said to be its great seat; by means of  these it obscures knowledge and stupefies man.    \",\"  Therefore, O Arjuna, bridle you first the senses and then rid yourself  of this sinner, the destroyer of knowledge and discrimination.   \",\"  Subtle, they say, are the senses; subtler than the senses is the mind; subtler  than the mind is the reason; but subtler even than the reason is He.     \",\"  Thus realizing Him to be subtler than the reason, and controlling the self by  the Self (Atman), destroy, O Arjuna, this enemy\\u2014Lust, so hard to  overcome. \",\"  Tell me, O Sanjaya, what my sons and Pandu's assembled, on battle intent, did on the field of Kuru, the field of duty. Sanjaya Said:   \",\"  On seeing the Arjuna's army drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana approached Drona, the preceptor, and addressed him thus:   \",\"  Behold, O preceptor, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, set in array by the son of Drupada, your wise disciple.   \",\"  Here are brave bowmen, peers of Bhima and Arjuna in fighting: Yuyudhana and Virata, and the \\u2018Maharatha' Drupada.   \",\"  Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, valorous Kashiraja, Purujit the Kuntibhoja, and Shaibya, chief among men;   \",\"  Valiant Yudhamanyu, valorous Uttamaujas, Subhadra's son, and the sons of Draupadi--each one of them a 'Maharatha'.   \",\"  Acquaint yourself now, O best of Brahmanas, with the distinguished among us. I mention for your information, the names of the captains of my army.   \",\"  Your noble self, Bhishma, Karna, and Kripa, victorious in battle, Ashvatthaman, Vikarna, also Somadatta's son;   \",\"  There is many another hero, known for his skill in wielding diverse weapons, pledged to lay down his life for my sake, and all adepts in war.   \",\"  This our force, commanded by Bhishma, is all too inadequate; while theirs, commanded by Bhima, is quite adequate.   \",\"  Therefore, let each of you, holding your appointed places, at every entrance, guard only Bhishma.   \",\"  At this, the heroic grandsire, the grand old man of the Kurus, gave a loud lion's roar and blew his conch to hearten Duryodhana.   \",\"  Thereupon, conches, drums, cymbals and trumpets were sounded all at once. Terrific was the noise.   \",\"  Then Krishna and Arjuna, standing in their great chariot yoked with white steeds, blew their divine conches.   \",\"  Krishna blew the Panchajanya and Arjuna the Devadatta; while the wolf-bellied Bhima of dread deeds sounded his great conch Paundra.    \",\"  King Yudhishthira, Kunti's son, blew the Anantavijaya, and Nakula and Sahadeva their conches, Sughosha and Manipushpaka.   \",\"  And Kashiraja, the great bowman, Shikhandi Dhrishtadyumna, Virata and Satyaki, the unconquerable; the 'Maharatha',    \",\"  Drupada, Draupadi's sons, the strong-armed son of Subhadra, all these, O King, blew each his own conch.   \",\"  That terrifying tumult, causing earth and heaven to resound, rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's sons.   \",\"  Then, O King, the ape-bannered Arjuna, seeing Dhritarashtra's sons arrayed and flight of arrows about to begin, took up his bow, and spoke thus to Krishna: \\\"Set my chariot between the two armies, O Krishna!\\\"  \",\"  Then, O King, the ape-bannered Arjuna, seeing Dhritarashtra's sons arrayed and flight of arrows about to begin, took up his bow, and spoke thus to Krishna: \\\"Set my chariot between the two armies, O Krishna!\\\"   \",\"  That I may behold them drawn up, on battle intent, and know whom I have to engage in this fearful combat;   \",\"  And that I may survey the fighters assembled here anxious to fulfil in battle perverse Duryodhana's desire. Sanjaya Said:   \",\"  Thus addressed by Arjuna, O King, Krishna set the unique  chariot between the two armies in front of Bhishma, Drona and all the kings  and said: Behold, O Arjuna, the Kurus assembled yonder.   \",\"  Thus addressed by Arjuna, O King, Krishna set the unique  chariot between the two armies in front of Bhishma, Drona and all the kings  and said: Behold, O Arjuna, the Kurus assembled yonder.  \",\"  Then did Arjuna see, standing there, sires, grandsires, preceptors, uncles,  brothers, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law and friends in both armies.  Beholding all these kinsmen ranged before him, Arjuna was overcome with  great compassion and spoke thus in anguish:  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  Then did Arjuna see, standing there, sires, grandsires, preceptors, uncles,  brothers, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law and friends in both armies.  Beholding all these kinsmen ranged before him, Arjuna was overcome with  great compassion and spoke thus in anguish:  Arjuna Said:  \",\"  Then did Arjuna see, standing there, sires, grandsires, preceptors, uncles,  brothers, sons, grandsons, comrades, fathers-in-law and friends in both armies.  Beholding all these kinsmen ranged before him, Arjuna was overcome with  great compassion and spoke thus in anguish:  Arjuna Said:  \",\"  As I look upon these kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled here eager to fight,  my limbs fail, my mouth is parched, a tremor shakes my frame and my hair  stands on end.  \",\"  As I look upon these kinsmen, O Krishna, assembled here eager to fight,  my limbs fail, my mouth is parched, a tremor shakes my frame and my hair  stands on end.   \",\"  Gandiva slips from my hand, my skin is on fire, I cannot keep my feet, and  my mind reels.   \",\"  I have unhappy forebodings, O Krishna; and I see no good in slaying  kinsmen in battle.   \",\"  I seek not victory, nor sovereign power, nor earthly joys. What good are  sovereign power, worldly pleasures and even life to us, O Krishna?      \",\"  Those for whom we would desire sovereign power, earthly joys and  delights are here arrayed in battle, having renounced life and wealth- \",\"  Preceptors, sires, grandsires, sons and even  fathers-in-law, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen.   grandsons,   uncles,    \",\"  These I would not kill, O Krishna, even though they slay me, not even  for kingship of the three worlds, much less for an earthly kingdom.   \",\"  What pleasure can there be in slaying these sons of Dhritarashtra, O  Krishna? Sin only can be our lot, if we slay these, usurpers though they be.   \",\"  It does not therefore behove us to kill our kinsmen, these sons of  Dhritarashtra. How may we be happy, O Krishna, in killing our own kins?   \",\"  Even though these, their wits warped by greed, see not the guilt that lies in  destroying the family, nor the sin of treachery to comrades;   \",\"  How can we, O Krishna, help recoiling from this sin, seeing clearly as we  do the guilt that lies in such destruction?   \",\"  With the destruction of the family perish the eternal family virtues, and with  the perishing of these virtues unrighteousness seizes the whole family.   \",\"  When unrighteousness prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family  become corrupt, and their corruption, O Krishna, causes a confusion of  varnas.   \",\"  This confusion verily drags the family-slayer, as well as the family, to hell,  and for want of obsequial offerings and rites their departed sires fall from  blessedness.   \",\"  By the sins of these family-slayers resulting in confusion of varnas, the  eternal tribal and family virtues are brought to nothing.   \",\"  For we have had it handed down to us, O Krishna, that the men whose  family virtues have been ruined are doomed to dwell in hell.   \",\"  Alas! What a heinous sin we are about to commit, in that, from greed of the  joy of sovereign power, we are prepared to slay our kith and kin!   \",\"  Happier far would it be for me if Dhritarashtra's sons, weapons in hand,  should strike me down on the battlefield, unresisting and unarmed.  Sanjaya Said:     \",\"  Thus spoke Arjuna on the field of battle, and dropping his bow and arrows  sank down on his seat in the chariot, overwhelmed with anguish.\",\"  To Arjuna, thus overcome with compassion, sorrowing, and his eyes  obscured by flowing tears, Krishna spoke these words:  The Lord Said:   \",\"  How is it that at this perilous moment this delusion, unworthy of the noble,  leading neither to heaven nor to glory, has overtaken you?   \",\"  Yield not to unmanliness, O Arjuna; it does not become you. Shake off this  miserable faint-heartedness and arise, O Arjuna!  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  How shall I, with arrows, engage Bhishma and Drona in battle, O  Krishna, they who are worthy of reverence, O Krishna?   \",\"  It were better far to live on alms of this world than to slay these venerable  elders. Having slain them I should but have blood-stained enjoyments.   \",\"  Nor do we know which is better for us, that we conquer them or that they  conquer us, for here stand before us Dhritarashtra's sons having killed whom  we should have no desire to live.     \",\"  My being is paralysed by faint-heartedness; my mind discerns not duty;  hence I ask you; tell me, I pray you, in no uncertain language, wherein lies my  good. I am your disciple; guide me; I see refuge in you.   \",\"  For I see nothing that can dispel the anguish that shrivels up my senses even  if I should win on earth uncontested sovereignty over a thriving kingdom or  lordship over the gods.  Sanjaya Said:   \",\"  Thus spoke Arjuna Arjuna to Krishna Krishna, and with the  words 'I will not fight' became speechless.   \",\"  To him thus stricken with anguish, O Arjuna! between the two armies,  Krishna, as though mocking, addressed these words:  The Lord Said:   \",\"  You mourn for them whom you should not mourn and utterest vain  words of wisdom. The wise mourn neither for the living nor for the dead.   \",\"  For never was I not, nor you, nor these kings; nor will any of us cease to be  hereafter.   \",\"  As the embodied one has, in the present body, infancy, youth and age, even  so does he receive another body. The wise man is not deceived therein.   \",\"  O Arjuna! Contacts of the senses with their objects bring cold and heat,  pleasure and pain; they come and go and are transient. Endure them, O  Arjuna.   \",\"  O noblest of men, the wise man who is not disturbed by these, who is  unmoved by pleasure and pain, he is fitted for immortality.   \",\"  What is non-Being is never known to have been, and what is Being is never  known not to have been. Of both these the secret has been seen by the seers of  the Truth.   \",\"  Know that to be imperishable whereby all this is pervaded. No one can  destroy that immutable being.   \",\"  These bodies of the embodied one who is eternal, imperishable and  immeasurable are finite. Fight, therefore, O Arjuna.   \",\"  He who thinks of This (Atman) as slayer and he who believes This to be  slain, are both ignorant. This neither slays nor is ever slain.    \",\"  This is never born nor ever dies, nor having been will ever not be any more;  unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient, This is not slain when the body is slain.   \",\"  He who knows This, O Arjuna, to be imperishable, eternal, unborn, and  immutable\\u2014whom and how can that man slay or cause to be slain?   \",\"  As a man casts off worn-out garments and takes others that are new, even so  the embodied one casts off worn-out bodies and passes on to others new.   \",\"  This no weapons wound, This no fire burns, This no waters wet, This no  wind does dry.   \",\"  Beyond all cutting, burning, wetting and drying is This-eternal,  all-pervading, stable, immovable, everlasting.   \",\"  Perceivable neither by the senses nor by the mind, This is called  unchangeable; therefore knowing This as such you should not grieve.   \",\"  And if you deems This to be always coming to birth and always dying,  even then, O Arjuna, you should not grieve.   \",\"  For certain is the death of the born, and certain is the birth of the dead;  therefore what is unavoidable you should not regret.   \",\"  The state of all beings before birth is unmanifest; their middle state manifest;  their state after death is again unmanifest. What occasion is there for lament, O  Arjuna?   \",\"  One looks upon This as a marvel; another speaks of This as such; another  hears thereof as a marvel; yet having heard This none truly knows This.   \",\"  This embodied one in the body of every being is ever beyond all harm, O  Arjuna; you should not, therefore, grieve for any one.   \",\"  Again, seeing yours own duty you should not shrink from it; for there is  no higher good for a Kshatriya than a righteous war.   \",\"  Such a fight, coming unsought, as a gateway to heaven thrown open, falls  only to the lot of happy Kshatriyas, O Arjuna.   \",\"  But if you will not fight this righteous fight, then failing in your duty and  losing yours honour you will incur sin.   \",\"  The world will for ever recount the story of your disgrace; and for a man of  honour disgrace is worse than death.   \",\"  The great warriors will think that fear made you retire from battle; and you  will fall in the esteem of those very ones who have held you high.   \",\"  Yours enemies will deride your prowess and speak many unspeakable words  about you. What can be more painful than that?   \",\"  Slain, you shall gain heaven; victorious, you shall inherit the earth:  therefore arise, O Arjuna, determined to fight.   \",\"  Hold alike pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat, and gird up  your loins for the fight; so doing you shall not incur sin.   \",\"  Thus have I set before you the attitude of Knowledge; hear now the attitude  of Action; resorting to this attitude you shall cast off the bondage of action.   \",\"  Here no effort undertaken is lost, no disaster befalls. Even a little of this  righteous course delivers one from great fear.   \",\"  The attitude, in this matter, springing, as it does, from fixed resolve is but  one, O Arjuna; but for those who have no fixed resolve the attitudes are  many-branched and unending.   \",\"  The ignorant, revelling in the letter of the Vedas, declare that there is  nothing else; carnally-minded, holding heaven to be their goal, they utter  swelling words which promise birth as the fruit of action and which dwell on  the many and varied rites to be performed for the sake of pleasure and power;  intent, as they are, on pleasure and power their swelling words rob them of  their wits, and they have no settled attitude which can be centered on the  supreme goal.   \",\"  The ignorant, revelling in the letter of the Vedas, declare that there is  nothing else; carnally-minded, holding heaven to be their goal, they utter  swelling words which promise birth as the fruit of action and which dwell on  the many and varied rites to be performed for the sake of pleasure and power;  intent, as they are, on pleasure and power their swelling words rob them of  their wits, and they have no settled attitude which can be centered on the  supreme goal.  \",\"  The ignorant, revelling in the letter of the Vedas, declare that there is  nothing else; carnally-minded, holding heaven to be their goal, they utter  swelling words which promise birth as the fruit of action and which dwell on  the many and varied rites to be performed for the sake of pleasure and power;  intent, as they are, on pleasure and power their swelling words rob them of  their wits, and they have no settled attitude which can be centered on the  supreme goal.   \",\"  The Vedas have as their domain the three gunas; eschew them, O Arjuna.  Free yourself from the pairs of opposites, abide in eternal truth, scorn to gain or  guard anything, remain the master of your soul.   \",\"  To the extent that a well is of use when there is a flood of water on all sides,  to the same extent are all the Vedas of use to an enlightened Brahmana.   \",\"  Action alone is your province, never the fruits thereof; let not your motive be  the fruit of action, nor should you desire to avoid action.   \",\"  Act you, O Arjuna, without attachment, steadfast in Yoga,  even-minded in success and failure. Even-mindedness is Yoga.   \",\"  For action, O Arjuna, is far inferior to unattached action; seek refuge in  the attitude of detached action. Pitiable are those who make fruit their motive.   \",\"  Here in this world a man gifted with that attitude of detachment escapes the  fruit of both good and evil deeds. Gird yourself up for Yoga, therefore. Yoga is  skill in action.   \",\"  For sages, gifted with the attitude of detachment, who renounce the fruit of  action, are released from the bondage of birth and attain to the state which is  free from all ills.   \",\"  When your understanding will have passed through the slough of delusion,  then will you be indifferent alike to what you have heard and will hear.   \",\"  When your understanding, distracted by much hearing, will rest steadfast  and unmoved in concentration, then will you attain Yoga.  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  What, O Krishna, is the mark of the man whose understanding is secure,  whose mind is fixed in concentration? How does he talk? How sit? How move.  The Lord Said:   \",\"  When a man puts away, O partha, all the cravings that arise in the mind and  finds comfort for himself only from soul, then he is called the man of secure  understanding.    \",\"  Whose mind is untroubled in sorrows and longs not for joys, who is free  from passion, fear and wrath\\u2014he is called the ascetic of secure understanding.   \",\"  Who owns attachment nowhere, who feels neither joy nor resentment  whether good or bad comes his way\\u2014that man's understanding is secure.   \",\"  And when, like the tortoise drawing in its limbs from every side, this man  draws in his senses from their objects, his understanding is secure.   \",\"  When a man starves his senses, the objects of those senses disappear from  him, but not the yearning for them; the yearning too departs when he beholds  the Supreme.    \",\"  For, in spite of the wise man's endeavour, O Arjuna, the unruly senses  distract his mind perforce.   \",\"  Holding all these in check, the yogi should sit intent on Me; for he whose  senses are under control is secure of understanding.   \",\"  In a man brooding on objects of the senses, attachment to them springs up;  attachment begets craving and craving begets wrath.   \",\"  Wrath breeds stupefaction, stupefaction leads to loss of memory, loss of  memory ruins the reason, and the ruin of reason spells utter destruction.   \",\"  But the disciplined soul, moving among sense-objects with the senses  weaned from likes and dislikes and brought under the control of soul, attains  peace of mind.    \",\"  Peace of mind means the end to all ills, for the understanding of him whose  mind is at peace stands secure.   \",\"  The undisciplined man has neither understanding nor devotion; for him  who has no devotion there is no peace, and for him who has no peace where  happiness?   \",\"  For when his mind runs after any of the roaming senses, it sweeps away his  understanding, as the wind a vessel upon the waters.   \",\"  Therefore, O Arjuna, he, whose senses are reined in on all sides from  their objects, is the man of secure understanding.   \",\"  When it is night for all other beings, the disciplined soul is awake; when all  other beings are awake, it is night for the seeing ascetic.    \",\"  He in whom all longings subside, even as the waters subside in the ocean  which, though ever being filled by them, never overflows\\u2014that man finds  peace; not he who cherishes longing.   \",\"  The man who sheds all longing and moves without concern, free from the  sense of \\u2018I' and \\u2018Mine'\\u2014he attains peace.   \",\"  This is the state, O partha, of the man who rests in Brahman; having attained  to it, he is not deluded. He who abides in this state even at the hour of death  passes into oneness with Brahman. \",\"  If, O Krishna, you hold that the attitude of detachment is superior to  action, then why, O Krishna, do you urge me to dreadful action?    \",\"  You do seem to confuse my understanding with perplexing speech; tell  me, therefore, in no uncertain voice, that alone whereby I may attain salvation.   The Lord Said:   \",\"  I have spoken, before, O sinless one, of two attitudes in this world\\u2014the  Sankhayas', that of Jnana yoga and the Yogins', that of karma yoga.   \",\"  Never does man enjoy freedom from action by not undertaking action, nor  does he attain that freedom by mere renunciation of action.   \",\"  For none ever remains inactive even for a moment; for all are compelled to  action by the gunas inherent in prakriti.   \",\"  He who curbs the organs of action but allows the mind to dwell on the  sense-objects,\\u2014such a one, wholly deluded, is called a hypocrite.   \",\"  But he, O Arjuna, who keeping all the senses under control of the mind,  engages the organs in Karma yoga, without attachment\\u2014that man excels.   \",\"  Do you your allotted task; for action is superior to inaction; with inaction even  life's normal course is not possible.   \",\"  This world of men suffers bondage from all action save that which is done for  the sake of sacrifice; to this end, O Arjuna, perform action without  attachment.   \",\"  Together with sacrifice did the Lord of beings create, of old, mankind,  declaring:  \\\"By this shall you increase; may this be to you the giver of all your desires.   \",\"  \\\"With this may you cherish the gods and may the gods cherish you; thus  cherishing one another may you attain the highest good.   \",\"  \\\"Cherished with sacrifice, the gods will bestow on you the desired boons.\\\"  He who enjoys their gifts without rendering aught unto them is verily a thief.   \",\"  The righteous men who eat the residue of the sacrifice are freed from all sin,  but the wicked who cook for themselves eat sin.   \",\"  From food springs all life, from rain is born food; from sacrifice comes rain  and sacrifice is the result of action.   \",\"  Know that action springs from Brahman and Brahman from the  Imperishable; hence the all-pervading Brahman is ever firm-founded on  sacrifice.   \",\"  He who does not follow the wheel thus set in motion here below, he, living  in sin, sating his senses, lives, O Arjuna, in vain.   \",\"  But the man who revels in soul, who is content in soul and who is  satisfied only with soul, for him no action exists.   \",\"  He has no interest whatever in anything done, nor in anything not done, nor  has he need to rely on anything for personal ends.    \",\"  Therefore, do you ever perform without attachment the work that you  must do; for performing action without attachment man attains the Supreme.   \",\"  For through action alone Janaka and others achieved perfection; even with a  view to the guidance of mankind you must act.   \",\"  Whatever the best man does, is also done by other men, what example he  sets, the world follows.   \",\"  For me, O Arjuna, there is nothing to do in the three worlds, nothing worth  gaining that I have not gained; yet I am ever in action.   \",\"  Indeed, for were I not, unslumbering, ever to remain in action, O Arjuna,  men would follow my example in every way.   \",\"  If I were not to perform my task, these worlds would be ruined; I should be  the same cause of chaos and of the end of all mankind.   \",\"  Just as, with attachment, the unenlightened perform all actions, O Arjuna,  even so, but unattached, should the enlightened man act, with a desire for the  welfare of humanity.   \",\"  The enlightened may not confuse the mind of the unenlightened, who are  attached to action; rather must he perform all actions unattached, and thus  encourage them to do likewise.   \",\"  All action is entirely done by the gunas of prakriti. Man, deluded by the  sense of \\u2018I', thinks, \\u2018I am the doer'.    \",\"  But he, O Arjuna, who understands the truth of the various gunas and  their various activities, knows that it is the gunas that operate on the gunas; he  does not claim to be the doer.   \",\"  Deluded by the gunas of prakriti men become attached to the activities of  the gunas; he who knows the truth of things should not unhinge the  slow-witted who have not the knowledge.   \",\"  Cast all your acts on Me, with your mind fixed on the indwelling soul, and  without any thought of fruit, or sense of \\u2018mine' shake off your fever and fight!   \",\"  Those who always act according to the rule I have here laid down, in faith  and without cavilling\\u2014they too are released from the bondage of their actions.   \",\"  But those who cavil at the rule and refuse to conform to it are fools, dead to  all knowledge; know that they are lost.   \",\"  Even a man of knowledge acts according to his nature; all creatures follow  their nature; what then will constraint avail?   \",\"  Each sense has its settled likes and dislikes towards its objects; man should  not come under the sway of these, for they are his besetters.   \",\"  Better one's own duty, bereft of merit, than another's well-performed; better  is death in the discharge of one's duty; another's duty is fraught with danger.   Arjuna Said:   \",\"  Then what impels man to sin, O Krishna, even against his will, as though  by force compelled?  The Lord Said:   \",\"  It is Lust, it is Wrath, born of the guna\\u2014Rajas. It is the arch-devourer, the  arch-sinner. Know this to be man's enemy here.   \",\"  As fire is obscured by smoke, a mirror by dirt, and the embryo by the  amnion, so is knowledge obscured by this.   \",\"  Knowledge is obscured, O Arjuna, by this eternal enemy of the wise man,  in the form of Lust, the insatiable fire.   \",\"  The senses, the mind and the reason are said to be its great seat; by means of  these it obscures knowledge and stupefies man.    \",\"  Therefore, O Arjuna, bridle you first the senses and then rid yourself  of this sinner, the destroyer of knowledge and discrimination.   \",\"  Subtle, they say, are the senses; subtler than the senses is the mind; subtler  than the mind is the reason; but subtler even than the reason is He.     \",\"  Thus realizing Him to be subtler than the reason, and controlling the self by  the Self (Atman), destroy, O Arjuna, this enemy\\u2014Lust, so hard to  overcome. \",\"  I expounded this imperishable yoga to Vivasvat; Vivasvat communicated it to  Manu, and Manu to Ikshvaku.   \",\"  Thus handed down in succession, the royal sages learnt it; with long lapse of  time it dwindled away in this world, O Arjuna.   \",\"  The same ancient yoga have I expounded to you today; for you are My  devotee and My friend, and this is the supreme mystery.  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  Later was Your birth, my Lord, earlier that of Vivasvat. How then am I to  understand that You didst expound it in the beginning?  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Many births have we passed through, O Arjuna, both you and I; I know  them all, you know them not, O Arjuna.  Though unborn and inexhaustible in My essence, though Lord of all beings, yet  assuming control over My Nature, I come into being by My mysterious power.   \",\"  For whenever Right declines and Wrong prevails, then O Arjuna, I come to  birth.     \",\"  To save the righteous, to destroy the wicked, and to re-establish Right I am  born from age to age.    \",\"  He who knows the secret of this My divine birth and action is not born again,  after leaving the body; he comes to Me, O Arjuna.    \",\"  Freed from passion, fear and wrath, filled full with Me, relying on Me, and  refined by the fiery ordeal of knowledge, many have become one with Me.   \",\"  In whatever way men resort to Me, even so do I render to them. In every  way, O Arjuna, the path men follow is Mine.    \",\"  Those who desire their actions to bear fruit worship the gods here; for in this  world of men the fruit of action is quickly obtainable.    \",\"  The order of the four varnas was created by Me according to the different  gunas and karma of each; yet know that though, therefore, author thereof,  being changeless I am not the author.   \",\"  Actions do not affect Me, nor am I concerned with the fruits thereof. He who  recognizes Me as such is not bound by actions.    \",\"  Knowing this did men of old, desirous of freedom, perform action; do you,  then, just as they did\\u2014the men of old in days gone by.   \",\"  \\u2018What is action? What is inaction?'\\u2014here even the wise are perplexed. I will  then expound to you that action knowing which you shall be saved from evil.   \",\"  For it is meet to know the meaning of action, of forbidden action, as also  inaction. Impenetrable is the secret of action.   \",\"  Who sees action in action and action in inaction, he is enlightened among  men, he is a yogi, he has done all he need do.    \",\"  He whose every undertaking is free from desire and selfish purpose, and he  who has burnt all his actions in the fire of knowledge\\u2014such an one the wise call  a pandita.   \",\"  He who has renounced attachment to the fruit of action, who is ever content,  and free from all dependence,\\u2014he, though immersed in action, yet acts not.   \",\"  Expecting nothing, holding his mind and body in check, putting away every  possession, and going through action only in the body he incurs no stain.   \",\"  Content with whatever chance may bring, rid of the pairs of opposites, free  from ill-will, even-minded in success and failure, he is not bound though he  acts.   \",\"  Of the free soul who has shred all attachment, whose mind is firmly  grounded in knowledge, who acts only for sacrifice, all karma is extinguished.   \",\"  The offering of sacrifice is Brahman; the oblation is Brahman; it is offered by  Brahman in the fire that is Brahman; thus he whose mind is fixed on acts  dedicated to Brahman must needs pass on to Brahman.   \",\"  Some yogins perform sacrifice in the form of worship of the gods, others  offer sacrifice of sacrifice itself in the fire that is Brahman.   \",\"  Some offer as sacrifice the sense of hearing and the other senses in the fires  of restraint; others sacrifice sound and the other objects of sense in the fires of  the senses.   \",\"  Others again sacrifice all the activities of the senses and of the vital energy in  the yogic fire of self-control kindled by knowledge.   \",\"  Some sacrifice with material gifts; with austerities; with yoga; some with the  acquiring and some with the imparting of knowledge. All these are sacrifices of  stern vows and serious endeavour.   \",\"  Others absorbed in the practices of the control of the vital energy sacrifice  the outward in the inward and the inward in the outward, or check the flow of  both the inward and the outward vital airs.   \",\"  Yet others, abstemious in food, sacrifice one form of vital energy in another.  All these know what sacrifice is and purge themselves of all impurities by  sacrifice.   \",\"  Those who partake of the residue of sacrifice\\u2014called amrita  (ambrosia)\\u2014attain to everlasting Brahman. Even this world is not for a  non-sacrificer; how then the next, O Arjuna?   \",\"  Even so various sacrifices have been described in the Vedas; know them all  to proceed from action; knowing this you shall be released.   \",\"  Knowledge-sacrifice is better, O-Parantapa, than material sacrifice, for all  action which does not bind finds its consummation in Knowledge (jnana).   \",\"  The masters of knowledge who have seen the Truth will impart to you this  Knowledge; learn it through humble homage and service and by repeated  questioning.   \",\"  When you have gained this knowledge, O Arjuna, you shall not again fall  into such error; by virtue of it you shall see all beings without exception in  yourself and thus in Me.   \",\"  Even though you be the most sinful of sinners, you shall cross the ocean of  sin by the boat of knowledge.   \",\"  As a blazing fire turns its fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, even so the fire of  Knowledge turns all actions to ashes.   \",\"  There is nothing in this world so purifying as Knowledge. He who is  perfected by yoga finds it in himself in the fullness of time.   \",\"  It is the man of faith who gains knowledge\\u2014the man who is intent on it and  who has mastery over his senses; having gained knowledge, he comes before long  to the supreme peace.   \",\"  But the man of doubt, without knowledge and without faith, is lost; for him  who is given to doubt there is neither this world nor that beyond, nor  happiness.   \",\"  He who has renounced all action by means of yoga, who has severed all  doubt by means of knowledge\\u2014him self-possessed, no actions bind, O  Arjuna!   \",\"  Therefore, with the sword of Self-realization sever you this doubt, bred of  ignorance, which has crept into your heart! Betake yourself to yoga and arise, O  Arjuna! \",\"  You laud renunciation of actions, O Krishna, whilst at the same time you  laud performance of action; tell me for a certainty which is the better.  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Renunciation and performance of action both lead to salvation; but of the  two, karmayoga (performance) is better than sannyasa (renunciation).     \",\"  Him one should know as ever renouncing who has no dislikes and likes; for  he who is free from the pairs of opposites is easily released from bondage.    \",\"  It is the ignorant who speak of sankhya and yoga as different, not so those  who have knowledge. He who is rightly established even in one wins to the  fruit of both.   \",\"  The goal that the sankhyas attain is also reached by the yogins. He sees truly  who sees both sankhya and yoga as one.   \",\"  But renunciation, O Arjuna, is hard to attain except by yoga; the ascetic  equipped with yoga attains Brahman before long.   \",\"  The yogi who has cleared himself, has gained mastery over his mind and all  his senses, who has become one with the soul in all creation, although he acts  he remains unaffected.   \",\"  The yogi who has seen the Truth knows that it is not he that acts whilst  seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, or breathing,   \",\"  Talking, letting go, holding fast, opening or closing the eyes\\u2014in the  conviction that is the senses that are moving in their respective spheres.   \",\"  He who dedicates his actions to Brahman and performs them without  attachment is not smeared by sin, as the lotus-leaf by water.   \",\"  Only with the body, mind and intellect and also with the senses, do the  yogins perform action without attachment for the sake of self-purification.   \",\"  A man of yoga obtains everlasting peace by abandoning the fruit of action;  the man ignorant of yoga, selfishly attached to fruit, remains bound.   \",\"  Renouncing with the mind all actions, the dweller in the body, who is  master of himself, rests happily in his city of nine gates, neither doing nor  getting anything done.   \",\"  The Lord creates neither agency nor action for the world; neither does he  connect action with its fruit. It is nature that is at work.   \",\"  The Lord does not take upon Himself anyone's vice or virtue; it is ignorance  that veils knowledge and deludes all creatures.   \",\"  But to them whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of soul, this  their knowledge, like the sun, reveals the Supreme.   \",\"  Those whose intellect is suffused with That, whose self has become one with  That, who abide in That, and whose end and aim is that, wipe out their sins  with knowledge, and go where there is no return.   \",\"  The men of Self-realization look with an equal eye on a brahmana  possessed of learning and humility, a cow, an elephant, a dog and even a  dog-eater.   \",\"  In this very body they have conquered the round of birth and death, whose  mind is anchored in sameness; for perfect Brahman is same to all, therefore in  Brahman they rest.   \",\"  He whose understanding is secure, who is undeluded, who knows Brahman  and who rests in Brahman, will neither be glad to get what is pleasant, nor sad  to get what is unpleasant.   \",\"  He who has detached himself from contacts without, finds bliss in soul;  having achieved union with Brahman he enjoys eternal bliss.   \",\"  For the joys derived from sense-contacts are nothing but mines of misery;  they have beginning and end, O Arjuna; the wise man does not revel therein.   \",\"  The man who is able even here on earth, before he is released from the body, to  hold out against the floodtide of lust and wrath,\\u2014he is a yogi, he is happy.   \",\"  He who finds happiness only within, rest only within, light only  within,\\u2014that yogi, having become one with nature, attains to oneness with  Brahman.   \",\"  They win oneness with Brahman\\u2014the seers whose sins are wiped out,  whose doubts are resolved, who have mastered themselves, and who are  engrossed in the welfare of all beings.   \",\"  Rid of lust and wrath, masters of themselves, the ascetics who have realized  soul find oneness with Brahman everywhere around them.   \",\"  That ascetic is ever free\\u2014who, having shut out the outward  sense-contacts, sits with his gaze fixed between the brows, outward and inward  breathing in the nostrils made equal; his senses, mind, and reason held in check;  rid of longing, fear and wrath; and intent on Freedom.   \",\"  That ascetic is ever free\\u2014who, having shut out the outward  sense-contacts, sits with his gaze fixed between the brows, outward and inward  breathing in the nostrils made equal; his senses, mind, and reason held in check;  rid of longing, fear and wrath; and intent on Freedom.  \",\"  Knowing Me as the Acceptor of sacrifice and austerity, the great Lord of all  the worlds, the Friend of all creation, the yogi attains to peace.\",\"  He who performs all obligatory action, without depending on the fruit  thereof, is a sannyasin and a yogin\\u2014not the man who neglects the sacrificial  fire nor he who neglects action.   \",\"  What is called sannyasa, know you to be yoga, O Arjuna; for none can  become a yogin who has not renounced selfish purpose.   \",\"  For the man who seeks to scale the heights of yoga, action is said to be the  means; for the same man, when he has scaled those heights, repose is said to be  the means.   \",\"  When a man is not attached either to the objects of sense or to actions and  sheds all selfish purpose, then he is said to have scaled the heights of yoga.   \",\"  By one's Self should one raise oneself, and not allow oneself to fall; for soul  (Self) alone is the friend of self, and Self alone is self's foe.   \",\"  His Self alone is friend, who has conquered himself by his Self: but to him  who has not conquered himself and is thus inimical to himself, even his Self  behaves as foe.   \",\"  Of him who has conquered himself and who rests in perfect calm the self is  completely composed, in cold and heat, in pleasure and pain, in honour and  dishonour.   \",\"  The yogin who is filled with the contentment of wisdom and discriminative  knowledge, who is firm as a rock, who has mastered his senses, and to whom a  clod of earth, a stone and gold are the same, is possessed of yoga.   \",\"  He excels who regards alike the boon companion, the friend, the enemy, the  stranger, the mediator, the alien and the ally, as also the saint and the sinner.   \",\"  Let the yogi constantly apply his thought to soul remaining alone in a  scheduled place, his mind and body in control, rid of desires and possessions.    \",\"  Fixing for himself, in a pure spot, a firm seat, neither too high nor yet too  low, covered with kusha grass, thereon a deerskin, and thereon a cloth;   \",\"  Sitting on that seat, with mind concentrated, the functions of thought and  sense of control, he should set himself to the practice of yoga for the sake of  self-purification.   \",\"  Keeping himself steady, holding the trunk, the neck and the head in a  straight line and motionless, fixing his eye on the tip of his nose, and looking  not around.   \",\"  Tranquil in spirit, free from fear, steadfast in the vow of brahmacharya,  holding his mind in control, the yogi should sit, with all his thoughts on Me,  absorbed in Me.   \",\"  The yogi, who ever thus, with mind controlled, unites himself to soul,  wins the peace which culminates in Nirvana, the peace that is in Me.   \",\"  Yoga is not for him who eats too much, nor for him who fasts too much,  neither for him who sleeps too much, nor yet for him who is too wakeful.   \",\"  To him who is disciplined in food and recreation, in effort in all activities,  and in sleep and waking, yoga (discipline) becomes a relief from all ills.   \",\"  When one's thought, completely controlled, rests steadily on only soul,  when one is free from longing for all objects of desire, then one is called a yogin.   \",\"  As a taper in a windless spot flickers not, even so is a yogin, with his  thought controlled, seeking to unite himself with soul.   \",\"  Where thought curbed by the practice of yoga completely ceases, where a  man sits content within himself, soul having seen soul;   \",\"  Where he experiences that endless bliss beyond the senses which can be  grasped by reason alone; wherein established he swerves not from the Truth;   \",\"  Where he holds no other gain greater than that which he has gained; and  where, securely seated, he is not shaken by any calamity however great;   \",\"  That state should be known as yoga (union with the Supreme), the disunion  from all union with pain. This yoga must one practice with firm resolve and  unwearying zeal.    \",\"  Shaking oneself completely free from longings born of selfish purpose;  reining in the whole host of senses, from all sides, with the mind itself;   \",\"  With reason held securely by the will, he should gradually attain calm and  with the mind established in soul think of nothing.   \",\"  Wherever the fickle and unsteady mind wanders, from there should it be reined  and brought under the sole sway of soul.   \",\"  The yogin, cleansed of all stain, unites himself ever thus to soul, easily  enjoys the endless bliss of contact with Brahman.   \",\"  The man equipped with yoga looks on all with an impartial eye, seeing  soul in all beings and all beings in soul.   \",\"  He who sees Me everywhere and everything in Me, never vanishes from Me  nor I from him.   \",\"  The yogin who, anchored in unity, worships Me abiding in all beings, lives  and moves in me, no matter how he live and move.   \",\"  He who, by likening himself with others, senses pleasure and pain equally  for all as for himself, is deemed to be the highest yogi, O Arjuna.  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  I do not see, O Krishna, how this yoga, based on the  equal-mindedness that You have expounded to me, can steadily endure,  because of fickleness (of the mind).   \",\"  For fickle is the mind, O Krishna, unruly, overpowering and stubborn; to  curb it is, I think, as hard as to curb the wind.  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Undoubtedly, O Arjuna, the mind is fickle and hard to curb; yet, O  Arjuna, it can be held in check by constant practice and dispassion.   \",\"  Without self-restraint, yoga, I hold, is difficult to attain; but the  self-governed soul can attain it by proper means, if he strives for it.  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  If one, possessed of faith, but slack of effort, because of his mind straying  from yoga, reach not perfection in yoga, what end does he come to, O Krishna?   \",\"  Without a foothold, and floundering in the path to Brahman fallen from  both, is he indeed not lost, O Krishna, like a dissipated cloud?   \",\"  This my doubt, O Krishna, do you dispel utterly; for there is to be found  none other than you to banish this doubt.  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Neither in this world, nor in the next, can there be ruin for him, O Arjuna; no  well-doer, oh loved one, meets with a sad end.   \",\"  Fallen from yoga, a man attains the worlds of righteous souls, and having  dwelt there for numberless years is then born in a house of pure and gentle  blood.   \",\"  Or he may even be born into a family of yogins, though such birth as this is  all too rare in this world.   \",\"  There, O Arjuna, he discovers the intellectual stage he had reached in  previous birth, and from there he stretches forward again towards perfection.   \",\"  By virtue of that previous practice he is borne on, whether he will it or not,  even he with a desire to know yoga passes beyond the Vedic ritual.   \",\"  But the yogi who perseveres in his striving, cleansed of sin, perfected  through many births, reaches the highest state.   \",\"  The yogin is deemed higher than the man of austerities; he is deemed also  higher than the man of knowledge; higher is he than the man engrossed in  ritual; therefore be you a yogin, O Arjuna!   \",\"  And among all yogins, he who worships Me with faith, his inmost self all  carried in Me, is deemed by me to be the best yogin.\",\"  Hear, O Arjuna, how, with your mind rivetted on me, by practicing yoga and  making me the sole refuge, you shall, without doubt, know me fully.   \",\"  I will declare to you, in its entirety, this knowledge, combined with  discriminative knowledge, which when you have known there remains here  nothing more to be known.   \",\"  Among thousands of men hardly one strives after perfection; among those  who strive hardly one knows Me in truth.   \",\"  Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Ether, Mind, Reason and Ego\\u2014thus eightfold is my  prakriti divided.   \",\"  This is My lower aspect; but know you My other aspect, the higher\\u2014which  is Jiva (the Vital Essence) by which, O Arjuna, this world is sustained.   \",\"  Know that these two compose the source from which all beings spring; I am  the origin and end of the entire universe.   \",\"  There is nothing higher than I, O Arjuna; all this is strung on Me as a  row of gems upon a thread.   \",\"  In water I am the savour, O Arjuna; in the sun and the moon I am the light;  the syllable AUM in all the Vedas; the sound in ether, and manliness in men.   \",\"  I am the sweet fragrance in earth; the brilliance in fire; the life in all beings;  and the austerity in ascetics.   \",\"  Know Me, O Arjuna, to be the primeval seed of all beings; I am the reason of  rational beings and the splendour of the splendid.   \",\"  Of the strong, I am the strength, divorced from lust and passion; in beings I  am desire undivorced from righteousness.   \",\"  Know that all the manifestations of the three gunas, sattva, rajas, and tamas,  proceed from none but Me; yet I am not in them; they are in Me.   \",\"  Befogged by these manifestations of the three gunas, the entire world fails to  recognize Me, the imperishable, as transcending them.    \",\"  For this My divine delusive mystery made up of the three gunas is hard to  pierce; but those who make Me their sole refuge pierce the veil.   \",\"  The deluded evil-doers, lowest of men, do not see refuge in Me; for, by  reason of this delusive mystery, they are bereft of knowledge and given to  devilish ways.   \",\"  Four types of well-doers are devoted to Me, O Arjuna; they are, O  Arjuna, the afflicted, the spiritual seeker, the material seeker, and the  enlightened.   \",\"  Of these the enlightened, ever attached to Me in single-minded devotion, is  the best; for to the enlightened I am exceedingly dear and he is dear to Me.   \",\"  All these are estimable indeed, but the enlightened I hold to be My very self;  for he, the true yogi, is stayed on Me alone, the supreme goal.   \",\"  At the end of many births the enlightened man finds refuge in Me; rare  indeed is this great soul to whom \\u2018Vasudeva is all'.   \",\"  Men, bereft of knowledge by reason of various longings, seek refuge in  other gods, pinning their faith on diverse rites, guided by their own nature.   \",\"  Whatever form one desires to worship in faith and devotion, in that very  form I make that faith of his secure.   \",\"  Possessed of that faith he seeks a propitiate that one, and obtains  there through his longings, dispensed in truth by none but Me.   \",\"  But limited is the fruit that falls to those shortsighted ones; those who  worship the gods go to the gods, those who worship Me come unto Me.   \",\"  Not knowing My transcendent, imperishable, supreme character, the  undiscerning think Me who am unmanifest to have become manifest.   \",\"  Veiled by the delusive mystery created by My unique power, I am not  manifest to all; this bewildered world does not recognize Me, birthless and  changeless.   \",\"  I know, O Arjuna, all creatures past, present and to be; but no one knows  Me.     \",\"  All creatures in this universe are bewildered, O Arjuna, by virtue of the  delusion of the pairs of opposite sprung from likes and dislikes, O Arjuna.   \",\"  But those virtuous men whose sin has come to an end, freed from delusion  and of the pairs of opposites, worship Me in steadfast faith.   \",\"  Those who endeavour for freedom from age and death by taking refuge in  Me, know in full that Brahman, Adhyatma and all Karma.   \",\"  Those who know Me, including Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva, Adhiyajna,  possessed of even-mindedness, they know Me even at the time of passing away.\",\"  What is that Brahman? What is Adhyatma? What Karma, O Krishna?  What is called Adhibhuta? And what Adhidaiva?   \",\"  And who here in this body is Adhiyajna and how? And how at the time of  death are You to be known by the self-controlled?  The Lord Said:   \",\"  The Supreme, the Imperishable is Brahman; its manifestation is Adhyatma;  the creative process whereby all beings are created is called Karma.   \",\"  Adhibhuta is My perishable form; Adhidaivata is the individual self in that  form; and O best among the embodied, Adhiyajna am I in this body, purified by  sacrifice.   \",\"  And he who, at the last hour remembering Me only, departs leaving the  body, enters into Me; of that there is no doubt.   \",\"  Or whatever form a man continually contemplates, that same he remembers  in the hour of death, and to that very form he goes, O Arjuna.   \",\"  Therefore at all times remember Me and fight on; your mind and reason thus  on Me fixed you shall surely come to Me.   \",\"  With thought steadied by constant practice, and wandering nowhere, he who  meditates on the Supreme Celestial Being, O Arjuna, goes to Him.   \",\"  Whoso, at the time of death, with unwavering mind, with devotion, and  fixing the breath rightly between the brows by the power of yoga, meditates on  the Sage, the Ancient, the Ruler, subtler than the subtlest, the Supporter of all,  the Inconceivable, glorious as the sun beyond the darkness,\\u2014he goes to that  Supreme Celestial Being.   \",\"  Whoso, at the time of death, with unwavering mind, with devotion, and  fixing the breath rightly between the brows by the power of yoga, meditates on  the Sage, the Ancient, the Ruler, subtler than the subtlest, the Supporter of all,  the Inconceivable, glorious as the sun beyond the darkness,\\u2014he goes to that  Supreme Celestial Being.  \",\"  That which the knowers of the Vedas call the Imperishable (or that word  which the knowers of the Vedas repeat), wherein the ascetics freed from  passion enter and desiring which they practice brahmacharya, that Goal (or  Word) I will declare to you in brief.   \",\"  Closing all the gates, locking up the mind in the hridaya, fixing his breath  within the head, carried in yogic meditation;   \",\"  Whoso departs leaving the body uttering AUM\\u2014Brahman in one  syllable\\u2014repeatedly thinking on Me, he reaches the highest state.   \",\"  That yogi easily wins to Me, O Arjuna, who, ever attached to Me, constantly  remembers Me with undivided mind.   \",\"  Great souls, having come to Me, reach the highest perfection; they come not  again to birth, unlasting and (withal) an abode of misery.   \",\"  From the world of Brahma down, all the worlds are subject to return, O  Arjuna; but on coming to Me there is no rebirth.   \",\"  Those men indeed know what is Day and what is Night, who know that  Brahma's day lasts a thousand yugas and that his night too is a thousand yugas  long.    \",\"  At the coming of Day all the manifest spring forth from the Unmanifest, and  at the coming of Night they are dissolved into that same Unmanifest.   \",\"  This same multitude of creatures come to birth, O Arjuna, again and again;  they are dissolved at the coming of Night, whether they will or not; and at the  break of Day they are re-born.   \",\"  But higher than the Unmanifest is another Unmanifest Being, everlasting,  which perishes not when all creatures perish.   \",\"  This Unmanifest, named the Imperishable, is declared to be the highest goal.  For those who reach it there is no return. That is my highest abode.   \",\"  This Supreme Being, O Arjuna, may be won by undivided devotion; in It all  beings dwell, by It all is pervaded.   \",\"  Now I will tell you, Arjuna, the conditions which determine the  exemption from return, as also the return, of yogins after they pass away hence.   \",\"  Fire, Light, Day, the Bright Fortnight, the six months of the Northern  Solstice\\u2014through these departing men knowing Brahman go to Brahman.   \",\"  Smoke, Night, the Dark Fortnight, the six months of the Southern  Solstice\\u2014There through the yogin attains to the lunar light and from there returns.    \",\"  These two paths\\u2014bright and dark\\u2014are deemed to be the eternal paths of  the world; by the one a man goes to return not, by the other he returns again.   \",\"  The Yogin knowing these two paths falls not into delusion, O Arjuna;  therefore, at all times, O Arjuna, remain steadfast in yoga.   \",\"  Whatever fruit of good deeds is laid down as accruing from (a study of) the  Vedas, from sacrifices, austerities, and acts of charity\\u2014all that the yogin  transcends, on knowing this, and reaches the Supreme and Primal Abode.\",\"  I will now declare to you, who are uncensorious, this mysterious knowledge,  together with discriminative knowledge, knowing which you shall be released  from ill.   \",\"  This is the king of sciences, the king of mysteries, pure and sovereign, capable  of direct comprehension, the essence of dharma, easy to practice, changeless.   \",\"  Men who have no faith in this doctrine, O Arjuna, far from coming to Me,  return repeatedly to the path of this world of death.   \",\"  By Me, unmanifest in form, this whole world is pervaded; all beings are in  Me, I am not in them.   \",\"  And yet those beings are not in Me. That indeed is My unique power as Lord!  Sustainer of all beings, I am not in them; My Self brings them into existence.   \",\"  As the mighty wind, moving everywhere, is ever contained in ether, even so  know that all beings are contained in Me.   \",\"  All beings, O Arjuna, merge into my prakriti, at the end of a kalpa, and I  send them forth again when a kalpa begins.   \",\"  Resorting to my prakriti, I send forth again and again this multitude of  beings, powerless under the sway of prakriti.   \",\"  But all this activity, O Arjuna, does not bind Me, seated as one  indifferent, unattached to it.   \",\"  With me as Presiding Witness, prakriti gives birth to all that moves and does  not move; and because of this, O Arjuna, the wheel of the world keeps going.   \",\"  Not knowing My transcendent nature as the sovereign Lord of all beings,  fools condemn Me incarnated as man.   \",\"  Vain are the hopes, actions and knowledge of those witless ones who have  resorted to the delusive nature of monsters and devils.   \",\"  But those great souls who resort to the divine nature, O Arjuna, know Me as  the Imperishable Source of all beings and worship Me with an undivided mind.   \",\"  Always declaring My glory, striving in steadfast faith, they do Me devout  homage; ever attached to Me, they worship Me.   \",\"  Yet others, with knowledge-sacrifice, worship Me, who am to be seen  everywhere, as one, as different or as many.   \",\"  I am the sacrificial vow; I am the sacrifice; I the ancestral oblation; I the herb;  I the sacred text; I the clarified butter; I the fire; I the burnt offering.   \",\"  Of this universe I am the Father, Mother, Creator, Grandsire: I am what is to  be known, the sacred syllable AUM; the Rig, the Saman and the Yajus;     \",\"  I am the Goal, the Sustainer, the Lord, the Witness, the Abode, the Refuge,  the Friend; the Origin, the End the Preservation, the Treasure house, the  Imperishable Seed.   \",\"  I give heat; I hold back and pour forth rain; I am deathlessness and also  death. O Arjuna, Being and not-Being as well.   \",\"  Followers of the three Vedas, who drink the soma juice and are purged of  sin, worship Me with sacrifice and pray for going to heaven; they reach the holy  world of the gods and enjoy in heaven the divine joys of the gods.   \",\"  They enjoy the vast world of heaven, and their merit spent, they enter the  world of the mortals; thus those who, following the Vedic law, long for the fruit  of their action earn but the round of birth and death.   \",\"  As for those who worship Me, thinking on Me alone and nothing else, ever  attached to Me, I bear the burden of getting them what they need.   \",\"  Even those who, devoted to other gods, worship them in full faith, even  they, O Arjuna, worship none but Me, though not according to the rule.   \",\"  For I am the Acceptor and the Director of all sacrifices; but not recognizing  Me as I am, they go astray.   \",\"  Those who worship the gods go to the gods; those who worship the manes  go to the manes; those who worship the spirits go to the spirits; but those who  worship Me come to Me.   \",\"  Any offering of leaf, flower, fruit or water, made to Me in devotion, by an  earnest soul, I lovingly accept.   \",\"  Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as  sacrifice or gift, whatever austerity you do perform, O Arjuna, dedicate all  to Me.   \",\"  So doing you shall be released from the bondage of action, yielding good  and evil fruit; having accomplished both renunciation and performance, you  shall be released (from birth and death) and come unto Me.   \",\"  I am the same to all beings; with Me there is non disfavoured, none  favoured; but those who worship Me with devotion are in Me and I in them.   \",\"  A sinner, howsoever great, if he turns to Me with undivided devotion, must  indeed be counted a saint; for he has a settled resolve.   \",\"  For soon he becomes righteous and wins everlasting peace; know for a  certainty, O Arjuna, that my bhakta never perishes.   \",\"  For finding refuge in Me, even those who though are born of the womb of  sin, women, vaishyas, and shudras too, reach the supreme goal.   \",\"  How much more then, the pure brahmanas and seer-kings who are my  devotees? Do you worship Me, therefore, since you have come to this fleeting  and joyless world.   \",\"  On Me fix your mind, to Me bring your devotion, to Me offer your sacrifice, to  Me make your obeisance; thus having attached yourself to Me and made Me your  end and aim, to Me indeed shall you come.\",\"  Yet once more, O Arjuna, here My supreme word, which I will utter to  you, gratified one, for your benefit.   \",\"  Neither the gods nor the great seers know My origin; for I am, every way, the  origin of them both.   \",\"  He who knows Me, the great lord of the worlds, as birthless and without  beginning, he among mortals, undeluded, is released from sins.   \",\"  Discernment, knowledge, freedom from delusion, long suffering, truth,  self-restraint, inward calm, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear and fearlessness;   \",\"  Non-violence, even-mindedness, contentment, austerity, beneficence, good  and ill fame,\\u2014all these various attributes of creatures proceed verily from Me.   \",\"  The seven great seers, the ancient four, and the Manus too were born of Me  and of My mind, and of them were born all the creatures in the world.   \",\"  He who knows in truth My immanence and My yoga becomes gifted with  unshakable yoga; of this there is no doubt.   \",\"  I am the source of all, all proceeds from me; knowing this, the wise worship  Me with hearts full of devotion.   \",\"  With me in their thoughts, their whole soul devoted to Me, teaching one  another, with me ever on their lips, they live in contentment and joy.   \",\"  To these, ever in tune with Me worshipping me with affectionate devotion, I  give the power of selfless action, whereby they come to Me.   \",\"  Out of every compassion for them, I who dwell in their hearts, destroy the  darkness, born of ignorance, with the refulgent lamp of knowledge.  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  Lord! You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme Abode, the supreme  Purifier! Everlasting Celestial Being, the Primal God, Unborn, All-pervading.   \",\"  Thus have all the seers\\u2014the divine seer Narada, Asita, Devala,  Vyasa\\u2014declared You; and You Yourself do tell me so.   \",\"  All that You tell me is true, I know, O Krishna, verily, Lord, neither the  gods nor the demons know Your manifestation.   \",\"  Yourself alone You know by Yourself, O Krishna, O Source and  Lord of all beings, God of Gods, O Ruler of the universe.   \",\"  Indeed You ought to tell me of all Your manifestations, without a  remainder, whereby You do pervade the worlds.   \",\"  O Yogin! constantly meditating on You, how am I to know You? In what  various aspects am I to think of You, O Lord?    \",\"  Recount to me yet again, in full detail, Your unique power and Your  immanence, O Krishna! For my ears cannot be sated with listening to Your  life-giving words.  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Yea, I will unfold to you, O Arjuna, My divine manifestations,\\u2014the  chief only; for there is no limit to their extent.   \",\"  I am the soul, O Arjuna, seated in the heart of every being; I am the  beginning, the middle and the end of all beings.   \",\"  Of the Adityas I am Vishnu; of luminaries, the radiant Sun; of Maruts, I am  Marichi; of constellations, the moon.   \",\"  Of the Vedas I am the Sama Veda; of the gods Indra; of the senses I am the  mind; of beings I am the consciousness.   \",\"  Of Rudras I am Shankara; of Yakshas and Rakshasas Kubera; of Vasus I am  the Fire; of mountains Meru.   \",\"  Of priests, O Arjuna, know Me to be the chief Brihaspati; of army captains I  am Kartikeya; and of waters the ocean.   \",\"  Of the great seers I am Bhrigu; of words I am the one syllable \\u2018AUM'; of  sacrifices I am the Japa sacrifice; of things immovable, the Himalaya.   \",\"  Of all trees I am Ashvattha; of the divine seers, Narada; of the heavenly  choir I am Chitraratha; of the perfected I am Kapila the ascetic.   \",\"  Of horses, Know Me to be the Uchchaihshravas born with immortality; of mighty  elephants I am Airavata; of men, the monarch.   \",\"  Of weapons, I am Vajra; of cows, Kamadhenu; I am Kandarpa, the god of  generation; of serpants I am Vasuki.   \",\"  Of cobras I am Anata; of water-dwellers I am Varuna; of the manes I am  Aryaman; and of the chastisers, Yama.   \",\"  Of demons I am Prahlada; of reckoners, the time; of beasts I am the lion; and  of birds, Garuda.   \",\"  Of cleansing agents I am the Wind; of wielders of weapons, Rama; of fishes I  am the crocodile; of rivers the Ganges.   \",\"  Of creations I am the beginning, end and middle, O Arjuna; of sciences, the  science of spiritual knowledge; of debators, the right argument.   \",\"  Of letters, the letter A; of compounds I am the dvandva; I am the  imperishable Time; I am the creator to be seen everywhere.   \",\"  All-seizing Death am I, as the source of things to be; in feminine virtues I am  Kirti (glory), Shri (beauty), Vak (speech), Smriti (memory), Medha  (intelligence), Dhriti (constancy) and Kshama (forgiveness).   \",\"  Of Saman hymns I am Brihat Saman; of metres, Gayatri; of months I am  Margashirsha; of seasons, the spring.   \",\"  Of deceivers I am the dice-play; of the splendid the splendour; I am victory,  I am resolution, I am the goodness of the good.   \",\"  Of Vrishnis I am Krishna; of Pandavas Arjuna; of ascetics I am Vyasa;  and of seers, Ushanas.   \",\"  I am the rod of those that punish; the strategy of those seeking victory; of  secret things I am silence, and the knowledge of those that know.   \",\"  Whatever is the seed of every being, O Arjuna, that am I; there is nothing,  whether moving or fixed, that can be without Me.   \",\"  there is no end to my divine manifestations; what extent of them I have told  you now is only by way of illustration.   \",\"  Whatever is glorious, beautiful and mighty know you that all such has  issued from a fragment of My splendour.   \",\"  But why need you to learn this at great length, O Arjuna? With but a  part of Myself I stand upholding this universe.\",\"  Out of Your grace towards me, you have told me the supreme mystery  revealing the knowledge of the Supreme; it has banished my delusion.   \",\"  Of the origin and destruction of beings I have heard from You in full detail,  as also Your imperishable ajesty [sic], O Kamala-patraksha!   \",\"  You are indeed as You have described Yourself, Supreme lord! I do crave to  behold, now, that form of Yours as Supreme Being.   \",\"  If, Lord, you thinks it possible for me to bear the sight, reveal to me, O  Krishna, Your imperishable form.  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Behold, O Arjuna, my forms divine in their hundreds and thousands,  infinitely diverse, infinitely various in color and aspect.   \",\"  Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the two Ashwins, the Maruts;  behold, O Arjuna, numerous marvels never revealed before.   \",\"  Behold today, O Arjuna, in my body, the whole universe, moving and  unmoving, all in one, and whatever else you craves to see.   \",\"  But you can not see Me with these yours own eyes. I give you the eye  divine; behold My sovereign power!  Sanjaya Said:   \",\"  With these words, O King, the great Lord of Yoga, Krishna, then revealed to  Arjuna His supreme form as Supreme Being.   \",\"  With many mouths and many eyes, many wondrous aspects, many divine  ornaments, and many brandished weapons divine.   \",\"  Wearing divine garlands and vestments, annointed with divine perfumes, it  was the form of God, all-marvellous [sic], infinite, seen everywhere.   \",\"  Were the splendour of a thousand suns to shoot forth all at once in the sky  that might perchance resemble the splendour of that Mighty One.   \",\"  Then did Arjuna see the whole universe in its manifold divisions gathered  as one in the body of that God of gods.   \",\"  Then Arjuna, wonderstruck and thrilled in every fibre of his being,  bowed low his head before the Lord, addressing Him thus with folded hands.  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  With Your form, O Lord, I see all the gods and the diverse multitudes of  beings, the Lord Brahma, on his lotus-throne and all the seers and serpents  divine.   \",\"  With many arms and bellies, mouths and eyes, I see Your infinite form  everywhere. Neither Your end, nor middle, nor beginning, do I see, O Lord of  the Universe, Universal-formed!   \",\"  With crown and mace and disc, a mass of effulgence, gleaming everywhere I  see You, so dazzling to the sight, bright with the splendour of the fiery sun  blazing from all sides,\\u2014incomprehensible.   \",\"  You are the Supreme Imperishable worthy to be known; You are the final  resting place of this universe; You are the changeless guardian of the Eternal  Dharma; You are, I believe, the Everlasting Being.   \",\"  You have no beginning, middle nor end; infinite is Your might; arms  innumerable; for eyes, the sun and the moon; Your mouth a blazing fire,  overpowering the universe with Your radiance.   \",\"  By You alone are filled the spaces between heaven and earth and all the  quarters; at the sight of this Your wondrous terrible form, the three worlds are  sore oppressed, O great-souled!   \",\"  Here, too, the multitudes of gods are seen to enter You; some awe-struck  praise You with folded arms; the hosts of great seers and siddhas, \\u2018All Hail' on  their lips, hymn You with songs of praise.   \",\"  The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas, all the gods, the twin Ashwins,  Maruts, Manes, the hosts of Gandharvas, Yakshas, Asuras and Siddhas\\u2014all  gaze on You in wonderment.     \",\"  At the sight of your mighty form, O Arjuna, many-mouthed, with eyes,  arms, thighs and feet innumerable, with many vast bellies, terrible with many  jaws, the worlds feel fearfully oppressed, and so do I.   \",\"  For as I behold You touching the sky, glowing, numerous-hued with  gaping mouths and wide resplendent eyes, I feel oppressed in my innermost  being; no peace nor quiet I find, O Vishnu!   \",\"  As I see Your mouths with fearful jaws, resembling the Fire of Doom, I lose  all sense of direction, and find no relief. Be gracious, O Krishna, O Krishna!   \",\"  All the sons of Dhritarashtra, and with them the crowd of kings, Bhishma,  Drona, and that Karna too, as also our chief warriors\\u2014   \",\"  Are hastening into the fearful jaws of Your terrible mouths. Some indeed,  caught between Your teeth, are seen, their heads being crushed to atoms.   \",\"  As rivers, in their numerous torrents, run head-long to the sea, even so the  heroes of the world of men rush into Your flaming mouths.   \",\"  As moths, fast-flying, plunge into blazing fire, straight to their doom, even  so these rush headlong into Your mouths, to their destruction.   \",\"  Devouring all these from all sides, You laps them with Your flaming  tongues; Your fierce rays blaze forth, filling the whole universe with their lustre.   \",\"  Tell me, Lord, who You are so dread of form! Hail to You, O Krishna! Be  gracious! I desire to know You, Primal Lord; for I comprehend not what You  do.  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Doom am I, full-ripe, dealing death to the worlds, engaged in devouring  mankind. Even without slaying them not one of the warriors, ranged for battle  against you, shall survive.   \",\"  Therefore, do you arise, and win renown! Defeat your foes and enjoy a  thriving kingdom. By Me have these already been destroyed; be you no more  than an instrument, O Arjuna!   \",\"  Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha and Karna, as also the other warrior  chiefs\\u2014already slain by Me\\u2014slay you! Fight! Victory is yours over the foes in  the field.  Sanjaya Said:   \",\"  Hearing this world of Krishna, crown-wearer Arjuna folded his hands, and  trembling made obeisance. Bowing and all hesitant, in faltering accents, he  proceeded to address Krishna once more.  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  Right proper it is, O Krishna, that Your praise should stir the world to  gladness and tender emotion; the Rakshasas in fear fly to every quarter and all  the hosts of Siddhas do reverent homage.   \",\"  And why should they not bow down to You, O great soul? You are the  First Creator, greater even than Brahma. O the endless one, O Krishna, O Krishna,  You are the Imperishable, Being, not-Being, and That which transcends even  these.   \",\"  You are the Primal God, the Ancient Being; You are the Final Resting Place  of this Universe; You are the Knower, the \\u2018to-be-known', the Supreme Abode;  by You, O Myriad-formed, is the universe pervaded.   \",\"  You are Vayu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, Shashanka, Prajapati, and  Prapitamaha! All Hail to You, a thousand times all hail! Again and yet again all  hail to You!   \",\"  All hail to You from before and behind! all hail to You from every side, O  All; Your prowess is infinite, Your might is measureless! You hold all;  therefore You are all.   \",\"  If ever in carelessness, thinking of You as comrade, I addressed You  saying, \\u2018O Krishna!', \\u2018O Yadava!' not knowing Your greatness, in negligence or in  affection,   \",\"  If ever I have been rude to You in jest, whilst at play, at rest-time, or at  meals, whilst alone or in company, O Krishna, forgive You my fault\\u2014I beg of  You, O Incomprehensible!   \",\"  You are Father of this world, of the moving and the un-moving; you are its  adored, its worthiest, Master; there is none equal to You; how then any greater  than You? Your power is matchless in the three worlds.   \",\"  Therefore, I prostrate myself before You, and beseech Your grace, O Lord  adorable! As father with son, as comrade with comrade, so should You bear,  beloved Lord, with me, Your loved one.   \",\"  I am filled with joy to see what never was seen before, and yet my heart is  oppressed with fear. Show me that original form of Yours, O Lord! Be gracious,  Krishna, O Krishna!    \",\"  I crave to see You even as You were, with crown, with mace, and disc in  hand; wear You, once more, that four-armed form, O thousand-armed  Krishna!  The Lord Said:   \",\"  It is to favour you, O Arjuna, that I have revealed to you, by My own  unique power, this My form Supreme, Resplendent, Universal, Infinite,  Primal\\u2014which none save you has ever seen.   \",\"  Not by the study of the Vedas, not by sacrifice, not by the study of other  scriptures, not by gifts, nor yet by performance of rites or of fierce austerities  can I, in such a form, be seen by any one save you in the world of men, O  Arjuna!   \",\"  Be you neither oppressed nor bewildered to look on this awful form of  Mine. Banish your fear, ease your mind, and lo! behold Me once again as I was.  Sanjaya Said.   \",\"  So said Krishna to Arjuna, and revealed to him once more His original  form. Wearing again His form benign, the great soul consoled him terrified.  Arjuna Said.   \",\"  Beholding again your benign human form I am come to myself and once  more in my normal state.  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Very hard to behold is that form of Mine which you have seen; even the  gods always yearn to see it.   \",\"  Not by the Vedas, not by penance, nor by gifts, nor yet by sacrifice, can any  behold Me in the form that you have seen.   \",\"  But by single-minded devotion, O Arjuna, I may in this form be known and  seen, and truly entered into, O Arjuna!   \",\"  He alone comes to me, O Arjuna, who does My work, who has made Me  his goal, who is My devotee, who has renounced attachment, who has ill-will  toward none. \",\"  Of the devotees who thus worship You, incessantly attached, and those who  worship the Imperishable Unmanifest, which are the better yogins?  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Those I regard as the best yogins who, riveting their minds on Me, ever  attached, worship Me, with the highest faith.   \",\"  But those who worship the Imperishable, the indefinable, the Unmanifest, the  Omnipresent, the Unthinkable, the Rock-seated, the Immovable, the  Unchanging,   \",\"  Keeping the whole host of senses in complete control, looking on all with an  impartial eye, engrossed in the welfare of all beings\\u2014these come indeed to Me.   \",\"  Greater is the travail of those whose mind is fixed on the Unmanifest; for it is  hard for embodied mortals to gain the Unmanifest\\u2014Goal.   \",\"  But those who casting all their actions on Me, making Me their all in all,  worship Me with the meditation of undivided devotion,   \",\"  Of such, whose thoughts are centered on Me, O Arjuna, I become before long the  Deliverer from the ocean of this world of death.    \",\"  On Me set your mind, on Me rest your conviction; thus without doubt shall you  remain only in Me hereafter.   \",\"  If you can not set your mind steadily on Me, then by the method of constant  practice seek to win Me, O Arjuna.   \",\"  If you are also unequal to this method of constant practice, concentrate on  service for Me; even thus serving Me you shall attain perfection.   \",\"  If you are unable even to do this, then dedicating all to Me, with mind  controlled, abandon the fruit of action.   \",\"  Better is knowledge than practice, better than knowledge is concentration,  better than concentration is renunciation of the fruit of all action, from which  directly issues peace.   \",\"  Who has ill-will towards none, who is friendly and compassionate, who has  shed all thought of \\u2018mine' or \\u2018I', who regards pain and pleasure alike, who is  long-suffering;   \",\"  Who is ever content, gifted with yoga, self-restrained, of firm conviction,  who has dedicated his mind and reason to Me\\u2014that devotee (bhakta) of Mine  is dear to Me.   \",\"  Who gives no trouble to the world, to whom the world causes no trouble,  who is free from exultation, resentment, fear and vexation,\\u2014that man is dear to  Me.   \",\"  Who expects nothing, who is pure, resourceful, unconcerned, untroubled,  who indulges in no undertakings,\\u2014that devotee of Mine is dear to Me.   \",\"  Who rejoices not, neither frets nor grieves, who covets not, who abandons  both good and ill\\u2014that devotee of Mine is dear to Me.   \",\"  Who is same to foe and friend, who regards alike respect and disrespect,  cold and heat, pleasure and pain, who is free from attachment;   \",\"  Who weighs in equal scale blame and praise, who is silent, content with  whatever his lot, who owns no home, who is of steady mind,\\u2014that devotee of  Mine is dear to Me.    \",\"  They who follow this essence of dharma, as I have told it, with faith,  keeping Me as their goal,\\u2014those devotees are exceeding dear to Me.\",\"  This body, O Arjuna, is called the Field; he who knows it is called the  knower of the Field by those who know.   \",\"  And understand Me to be, O Arjuna, the knower of the Field in all the Fields;  and the knowledge of the Field and the knower of the Field, I hold, is true  knowledge.   \",\"  What the Field is, what its nature, what its modifications, and where is  what, as also who He is, and what His power\\u2014hear this briefly from Me.   \",\"  This subject has been sung by seers distinctively and in various ways, in  different hymns as also in aphoristic texts about Brahman well reasoned and  unequivocal.   \",\"  The great elements, Individuation, Reason, the Unmanifest, the ten senses,  and the one (mind), and the five spheres of the senses;   \",\"  Desire, dislike, pleasure, pain, association, consciousness, cohesion\\u2014this, in  sum, is what is called the Field with its modifications.   \",\"  Freedom from pride and pretentiousness, nonviolence, forgiveness,  uprightness, service of the Master, purity, steadfastenes, self-restraint;   \",\"  Aversion from sense-objects, absence of conceit, realization of the painfulness  and evil of birth, death, age and disease;   \",\"  Absence of attachment, refusal to be wrapped up in one's children, wife,  home and family, even-mindedness whether good or ill befall;   \",\"  Unwavering and all-exclusive devotion to Me, resort to secluded spots,  distaste for the haunts of men;   \",\"  Settled conviction of the nature of the soul, perception of the goal of the  knowledge of Truth,\\u2014   \",\"  I will (now) expound to you that which is to be known and knowing which  one enjoys immortality; it is the supreme Brahman which has no beginning,  which is called neither Being nor non-Being.   \",\"  Everywhere having hands and feet, everywhere having eyes, heads,  mouths, everywhere having ears, It abides embracing everything in the  universe.   \",\"  Seeming to possess the functions of the senses, It is devoid of all the senses;  It touches nothing, upholds all; having no gunas, It experiences the gunas.   \",\"  Without all beings, yet within; immovable yet moving, so subtle that It  cannot be perceived; so far and yet so near It is.  \",\"  Undivided, It seems to subsist divided in all beings; this Brahman\\u2014 That which is to be known as the Sustainer of all, yet It is their Devourer and Creator.   \",\"  Light of all lights, It is said to be beyond darkness; It is knowledge, the  object of knowledge, to be gained only by knowledge; It is seated in the hearts  of all.   \",\"  Thus have I expounded in brief the Field, Knowledge and That which is to  be known; My devotee, when he knows this, is worthy to become one with Me.   \",\"  Know that Prakriti and Purusha are both without beginning; know that all  the modifications and gunas are born of Prakriti.   \",\"  Prakriti is described as the cause in the creation of effects from causes;  Purusha is described as the cause of the experiencing of pleasure and pain.   \",\"  For the Purusha, residing in Prakriti, experiences the gunas born in Prakriti;  attachment to these gunas is the cause of his birth in good or evil wombs.   \",\"  What is called in this body the Witness, the Assentor, the Sustainer, the  Experiencer, the Great Lord and also the Supreme soul, is Supreme Being.   \",\"  He who thus knows Purusha and Prakriti with its gunas, is not born again,  no matter how he live and move.   \",\"  Some through meditation hold the soul by themselves in their own self;  others by Sankhya Yoga, and others by Karma Yoga.   \",\"  Yet others, not knowing (Him) thus, worship (Him) having heard from  others; they too pass beyond death, because of devoted adherence to what they  have heard.   \",\"  Wherever something is born, animate or inanimate, know you  Arjuna, that it issues from the union of the Field and the Knower of the  Field.     \",\"  Who sees abiding in all beings the same Supreme lord, imperishable in the  perishable, he sees indeed.   \",\"  When he sees the same Supreme Being abiding everywhere alike, he does not hurt  himself by himself and hence he attains the highest goal.   \",\"  Who sees that it is Prakriti that performs all actions and thus (knows) that  soul performs them not, he sees indeed.   \",\"  When he sees the diversity of beings as founded in unity and the whole  expanse issuing therefrom, then he attains to Brahman.   \",\"  This imperishable Supreme soul, O Arjuna, though residing in the  body, acts not and is not stained, for he has no beginning and no gunas.   \",\"  As the all-pervading ether, by reason of its subtlety, is not soiled even so  soul pervading every part of the body is not soiled.   \",\"  As the one Sun illumines the whole universe, even so the Master of the Field  illumines the whole field, O Arjuna!   \",\"  Those who, with the eyes of knowledge, thus perceive the distinction  between the Field and the Knower of the Field, and (the secret) of the release o  beings from Prakriti, they attain to the Supreme.\",\"  Yet again I will expound the highest and the best of all knowledge, knowing  which all the sages passed hence to the highest perfection.   \",\"  By having recourse to this knowledge they became one with Me. They need  not come to birth even at a creation, nor do they suffer at a dissolution.   \",\"  The great prakriti is for me the womb in which I deposit the germ; from it all  beings come to birth, O Arjuna.   \",\"  Whatever forms take birth in the various species, the great prakriti is their  Mother and I the seed-giving Father.   \",\"  Sattva, rajas and tamas are the gunas sprung from prakriti; it is they, O  Arjuna, that keep the imperishable Dweller bound to the body.   \",\"  Of these sattva, being stainless, is light-giving and healing; it binds with the  bond of happiness and the bond of knowledge, O sinless one.   \",\"  Rajas, know you, is of the nature of passion, the source of thirst and  attachment; it keeps man bound with the bond of action.   \",\"  Tamas, know you, born of ignorance, is mortal man's delusion; it keeps him  bound with heedlessness, sloth and slumber, O Arjuna.   \",\"  Sattva attaches man to happiness, rajas to action, and tamas, shrouding  knowledge, attaches him to heedlessness.   \",\"  Sattva prevails, O Arjuna, having overcome rajas and tamas; rajas, when it  has overpowered sattva and tamas; likewise tamas reigns when sattva and rajas  are crushed.   \",\"  When the light\\u2014knowledge\\u2014shines forth from al the gates of this body,  then it may be known that the sattva thrives.   \",\"  Greed, activity, assumption of undertakings, restlessness, craving\\u2014these are  in evidence when rajas flourishes, O Arjuna.   \",\"  Ignorance, dullness, heedlessness, and delusion\\u2014these are in evidence  when tamas reigns, O Arjuna.   \",\"  If the embodied one meets his end whilst sattva prevails, then he attains to  the spotless worlds of the knowers of the Highest.    \",\"  If he dies during the reign within him of rajas, he is born among men  attached to action; and if he dies in tamas, he is born in species not endowed  with reason.   \",\"  The fruit of sattvika action is said to be stainless merit. That of rajas is pain  and that of tamas ignorance.   \",\"  Those abiding in sattva rise upwards, those in rajas stay midway, those in  tamas sink downwards.   \",\"  when the seer perceives no agent other than the gunas, and knows Him who  is above the gunas, he attains to My being.   \",\"  When the embodied one transcends these three gunas which are born of his  contact with the body, he is released from the pain of birth, death and age and  attains deathlessness.  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  What, O Lord, are the marks of him who has transcended the three gunas?  How does he conduct himself? How does he transcend the three gunas?  The Lord Said:   \",\"  He, O Arjuna, who does not disdain light, activity, and delusion when  they come into being, nor desires them when they vanish;   \",\"  He, who seated as one indifferent, is not shaken by the gunas, and stays still  and moves not, knowing it is gunas playing their parts;   \",\"  He who holds pleasure and pain alike, who is sedate, who regards as same  earth, stone and gold, who is wise and weighs in equal scale things pleasant  and unpleasant, who is even-minded in praise and blame;   \",\"  Who holds alike respect and disrespect, who is the same to friend and foe,  who indulges in no undertakings\\u2014That man is called gunatita.   \",\"  He who serves me in an unwavering and exclusive bhaktiyoga transcends  these gunas and is worthy to become one with Brahman.   \",\"  For I am the very image of Brahman, changeless and deathless, as also of  everlasting dharma and perfect bliss.\",\"  With the root above and branches below, the ashvattha tree, they say, is  impossible; it has Vedic hymns for its leaves; he who knows it knows the Vedas.   \",\"  Above all and below its branches spread, blossoming because of the gunas,  having for their shoots the sense-objects; deep down in the world of men are  ramified its roots, in the shape of the consequences of action.   \",\"  Its form as such is not here perceived, neither is its end, nor beginning, nor  basis. Let man first hew down this deep-rooted Ashvattha with the sure  weapon of detachment;   \",\"  Let him pray to win to that haven from which there is no return and seek to  find refuge in the primal Being from whom has emanated this ancient world of  action.   \",\"  To that imperishable haven those enlightened souls go\\u2014who are without  pride and delusion, who have triumphed over the taints of attachment, who are  ever in tune with the Supreme, whose passions have died, who are exempt  from the pairs of opposites, such as pleasure and pain.   \",\"  Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor fire illumine it; men who arrive there  return not\\u2014that is My supreme abode.   \",\"  As part indeed of Myself which has been the eternal Jiva(the Vital Essence) in this world of life,  attracts the mind and the five senses from their place in prakriti.   \",\"  When the master (of the body) acquires a body and discards it he carries  these with him wherever he goes, even as the wind carries scents from flower  beds.   \",\"  Having settled himself in the senses\\u2014ear, eye, touch, taste, and smell\\u2014as  well as the mind, through them he frequents their objects.   \",\"  The deluded perceive Him not as He leaves or settles in (a body) or enjoys  (sense objects) in association with the gunas; it is those endowed with the eye of  knowledge who alone see Him.   \",\"  Yogins who strive see Him seated in themselves; the witless ones who have  not cleansed themselves to see Him not, even though they strive.   \",\"  The light in the sun which illumines the whole universe and which is in the  moon and in fire\\u2014that light, know you, is Mine;   \",\"  It is I, who penetrating the earth uphold all beings with My strength, and  becoming the moon\\u2014the essence of all sap\\u2014nourish all the herbs;   \",\"  It is I who becoming the Vaishvanara Fire and entering the bodies of all that  breathe, assimilate the four kinds of food with the help of the outward and the  inward breaths.   \",\"  And I am seated in the hearts of all, from Me proceed memory, knowledge  and the dispelling of doubts; it is I who am to be known in all the Vedas, I, the  author of Vedanta and the knower of the Vedas.   \",\"  There are two Beings in the world: perishable (perishable) and imperishable  (imperishable). Perishable embraces all creatures and their permanent basis is  imperishable.   \",\"  The Supreme Being is surely another\\u2014called eternal Soul who is the  Imperishable Supreme Being pervades and supports the three worlds.   \",\"  Because I transcend the perishable and am also higher than the imperishable, I am  known in the world and in the Vedas as Krishna (the Highest Being).   \",\"  He who, undeluded, knows Me as Krishna, knows all, he worships  Me with all his heart, O Arjuna.    \",\"  Thus I have revealed to you, sinless one, this most mysterious shastra; he  who understands this, O Arjuna, is a man of understanding, he has fulfilled his  life's mission.\",\"  Fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in jnana and yoga\\u2014knowledge  and action, beneficence, self-restraint, sacrifice, spiritual study, austerity, and  uprightness;   \",\"  Non-violence, truth, slowness to wrath, the spirit of dedication, serenity,  aversion to slander, tenderness to all that lives, freedom from greed, gentleness,  modesty, freedom from levity;   \",\"  Spiritedness, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom from ill-will and  arrogance\\u2014these are to be found in one born with the divine heritage, O  Arjuna.   \",\"  Pretentiousness, arrogance, self-conceit, wrath, coarseness, ignorance\\u2014these  are to be found in one born with the devilish heritage.   \",\"  The divine heritage makes for Freedom, the devilish for bondage. Grieve not,  O Arjuna; you are born with a divine heritage.   \",\"  There are two orders of created beings in this world\\u2014the divine and the  devilish; the divine order has been described in detail, hear from Me now of the  devilish, O Arjuna.   \",\"  Men of the devil do not know what they may do and what they may not do;  neither is there any purity, nor right conduct, nor truth to be found in them.   \",\"  \\u2018Without truth, without basis, without God is the universe,' they say; \\u2018born of  the union of the sexes, prompted by nothing but lust.'   \",\"  Holding this view, these depraved souls, of feeble understanding and of  fierce deeds, come forth as enemies of the world to destroy it.     \",\"  Given to insatiable lust, possessed by pretentiousness, arrogance and  conceit, they seize wicked purposes in their delusion, and go about pledged to  uncleaned deeds.   \",\"  Given to boundless cares that end only with their death, making indulgence  or lust their sole goal, convinced that that is all;   \",\"  Caught in a myriad snares of hope, slaves to lust and wrath, they speak  unlawfully to amass wealth for the satisfaction of their appetites.   \",\"  \\u2018This have I gained today; this aspiration shall I now attain; this wealth is  mine; this likewise shall be mine hereafter;   \",\"  \\u2018This enemy I have already slain, others also I shall slay; lord of all am I;  enjoyment is mine, perfection is mine, strength is mine, happiness is mine;   \",\"  \\u2018Wealthy am I, and high-born. What other is like unto me? I shall perform a  sacrifice! I shall give alms! I shall be merry!' Thus think they, by ignorance  deluded;   \",\"  And tossed about by diverse fancies, caught in the net of delusion, stuck  deep in the indulgence of appetites, into foul hell they fall.   \",\"  Wise in their own conceit, stubborn, full of the intoxication of pelf and pride,  they offer nominal sacrifices for show, contrary to the rule.   \",\"  Given to pride, force, arrogance, lust and wrath they are deriders indeed,  scorning Me in their own and other' bodies.   \",\"  These cruel scorners, lowest of mankind and vile, I hurl down again and  again, into devilish wombs.   \",\"  Doomed to devilish wombs, these deluded ones, far from ever coming to  Me, sink lower and lower in birth after birth.   \",\"  Three-fold is the gate of hell, leading man to perdition\\u2014Lust, Wrath, and  Greed; these three, therefore, should be shunned.   \",\"  The man who escapes these three gates of Darkness, O Arjuna, works out  his welfare and from there reaches the highest state.   \",\"  He who forsakes the rule of shastra and does but the bidding of his selfish  desires, gains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the highest state.  Shastra does not mean the rites and formulae laid down in the so-called  dharmashastra, but the path of self-restraint laid down by the seers and the  saints.    \",\"  Therefore let shastra be your authority for determining what ought to be  done and what ought not to be done; ascertain you the rule of the shastra and  do your task here (accordingly).\",\"  What, then, O Krishna, is the position of those who forsake the rule of Shastra  and yet worship with faith? Do they act from sattva or rajas or tamas?  The Lord Said:   \",\"  Threefold is the faith of men, an expression of their nature in each case; it is  sattvika, rajas or tamasa. Hear you of it.   \",\"  The faith of every man is in accord with his innate character; man is made up  of faith; whatever his object of faith, even so is he.   \",\"  Sattvika persons worship the gods; rajas ones, the Yakshas and Rakshasas;  and others\\u2014men of tamas\\u2014worship manes and spirits.   \",\"  Those men who, wedded to pretentiousness and arrogance, possessed by the  violence of lust and passion, practice fierce austerity not ordained by shastra;     \",\"  They, whilst they torture the several elements that make up their bodies,  torture Me too dwelling in them; know them to be of unholy resolves.   \",\"  Of three kinds again is the food that is dear to each; so also are sacrifice,  austerity, and charity. Hear how they differ.   \",\"  Victuals that add to one's years, vitality, strength, health, happiness and  appetite; are savoury, rich, substantial and inviting, are dear to the sattvika.   \",\"  Victuals that are bitter, sour, salty, over-hot, spicy, dry, burning, and causing  pain, bitterness and disease, are dear to rajasa.   \",\"  Food which has become cold, insipid, putrid, stale, discarded and unfit for  sacrifice, is dear to the tamasa.   \",\"  That sacrifice is sattvika which is willingly offered as a duty without desire  for fruit and according to the rule.   \",\"  But when sacrifice is offered with an eye to fruit and for vain glory, know, O  Arjuna, that it is rajasa.   \",\"  Sacrifice which is contrary to the rule, which produces no food, which lacks  the sacred text, which involves no giving up, which is devoid of faith is said to  be tamasa.   \",\"  Homage to the gods, to Brahmanas, to gurus and to wise men; cleanliness,  uprightness, brahmacharya and non-violence\\u2014these constitute austerity (tapas)  of the body.   \",\"  Words that cause no hurt, that are true loving and helpful, and spiritual  study constitute austerity of speech.   \",\"  Serenity, benignity, silence, self-restraint, and purity of the spirit\\u2014these  constitute austerity of the mind.   \",\"  This threefold austerity practiced in perfect faith by men not desirous of  fruit, and disciplined, is said to be sattvika.   \",\"  Austerity which is practiced with an eye to gain praise, honour and homage  and for ostentation is said to be rajasa; it is fleeting and unstable.   \",\"  Austerity which is practiced from any foolish obsession, either to torture  oneself or to procure another's ruin, is called tamasa.   \",\"  Charity, given as a matter of duty, without expectation of any return, at the  right place and time, and to the right person is said to be sattvika.    \",\"  Charity, which is given either in hope of receiving in return, or with a view  of winning merit, or grudgingly, is declared to be rajasa.   \",\"  Charity given at the wrong place and time, and to the undeserving recipient  disrespectfully and with contempt is declared to be tamasa.   \",\"  AUM TAT SAT has been declared to be the threefold name of Brahman and  by that name were created of old the Brahmanas, the Vedas and sacrifices.   \",\"  Therefore, with AUM ever on their lips, are all the rites of sacrifice, charity  and austerity, performed always to the rule, by Brahmavadins.   \",\"  With the utterance of TAT and without the desire for fruit are the several  rites of sacrifice, austerity and charity performed by those seeking Freedom.   \",\"  SAT is employed in the sense of \\u2018real' and \\u2018good'; O Arjuna, SAT is also  applied to beautiful deeds.   \",\"  Constancy in sacrifice, austerity and charity, is called SAT; and all work for  those purposes is also SAT.   \",\"  Whatever is done, O Arjuna, by way of sacrifice, charity or austerity or any  other work, is called Asat if done without faith. It counts for nothing hereafter as  here.\",\"  Arjuna! I would fain learn severally the secret of sannyasa and of tyaga, O  Krishna, O Krishna.   The Lord Said:   \",\"  Renunciation of actions springing from selfish desire is known as sannyasa  by the seers; abandonment of the fruit of all action is called tyaga by the wise.   \",\"  Some thoughtful persons say: \\u2018All action should be abandoned as an evil';  others say: \\u2018Action for sacrifice, charity and austerity should not be  relinquished'.   \",\"  Hear my decision in this matter of tyaga, O Arjuna; for tyaga, too, O  mightiest of men, has been described to be of three kinds.   \",\"  Action for sacrifice, charity and austerity may not be abandoned; it must  needs be performed. Sacrifice, charity and austerity are purifiers of the wise.   \",\"  But even these actions should be performed abandoning all attachment and  fruit; such, O Arjuna, is my best and considered opinion.   \",\"  It is not right to renounce one's allotted task; its abandonment, from delusion,  is said to be tamasa.   \",\"  He who abandons action, deeming it painful and for fear of straining his  limbs, he will never gain the fruit of abandonment, for his abandonment is  rajasa.   \",\"  But when an allotted task is performed from a sense of duty and with  abandonment of attachment and fruit, O Arjuna, that abandonment is deemed  to be sattvika.   \",\"  Neither does he disdain unpleasant action, nor does he cling to pleasant  action\\u2014this wise man full of sattva, who practices abandonment, and who has  shaken off all doubts.   \",\"  For the embodied one cannot completely abandon action; but he who  abandons the fruit of action is named a tyagi.   \",\"  To those who do not practice abandonment accrues, when they pass away,  the fruit of action which is of three kinds: disagreeable, agreeable, mixed; but  never to the sannyasins.   \",\"  Learn, from me, O Arjuna, the five factors mentioned in the Sankhyan  doctrine for the accomplishment of all action:   \",\"  The field, the doer, the various means, the several different operations, the  fifth and the last, the Unseen.    \",\"  Whatever action, right or wrong, a man undertakes to do with the body,  speech or mind, these are the five factors thereof.   \",\"  This being so, he who, by reason of unenlightened intellect, sees the  unconditioned soul as the agent\\u2014such a man is dense and unseeing.   \",\"  He who is free from all sense of \\u2018I', whose motive is untainted, slays not nor  is bound, even though he slay all these worlds.   \",\"  Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower compose the threefold  urge to action; the means, the action and the doer compose the threefold sum of  action.   \",\"  Knowledge, action, and the doer are of three kinds according to their  different gunas; hear you these, just as they have been described in the science  of the gunas.   \",\"  Know that knowledge whereby one sees in all beings immutable entity\\u2014a  unity in diversity\\u2014to be sattvika.   \",\"  That knowledge which perceives separately in all beings several entities of  diverse kinds, know you to be rajasa.   \",\"  And knowledge which, without reason, clings to one single thing, as though  it were everything, which misses the true essence and is superficial is tamasa.   \",\"  That action is called sattvika which, being one's allotted task, is performed  without attachment, without like or dislike, and without a desire for fruit.   \",\"  That action which is prompted by the desire for fruit, or by the thought of  \\u2018I', and which involves much dissipation of energy is called rajasa.    \",\"  That action which is blindly undertaken without any regard to capacity and  consequences, involving loss and hurt, is called tamasa.   \",\"  That doer is called sattvika who has shed all attachment, all thought of \\u2018I',  who is filled with firmness and zeal, and who recks neither success nor failure.   \",\"  That doer is said to be rajasa who is passionate, desirous of the fruit of  action, greedy, violent, unclean, and moved by joy and sorrow.   \",\"  That doer is called tamasa who is undisciplined, vulgar, stubborn, knavish,  spiteful, indolent, woebegone, and dilatory.   \",\"  Hear now, O Arjuna, detailed fully and severally, the threefold division  of understanding and will, according to their gunas.   \",\"  That understanding, O Arjuna, is sattvika which knows action from inaction,  what ought to be done from what ought not to be done, fear from fearlessness  and bondage from release.   \",\"  That understanding, O Arjuna, is rajasa, which decides erroneously between  right and wrong, between what ought to be done and what ought not to be  done.   \",\"  That understanding, O Arjuna, is tamasa, which, shrouded in darkness,  thinks wrong to be right and mistakes everything for its reverse.   \",\"  That will, O Arjuna, is sattvika which maintains an unbroken harmony  between the activities of the mind, the vital energies and the senses.   \",\"  That will, O Arjuna, is rajasa which clings, with attachment, to  righteousness, desire and wealth, desirous of fruit in each case.   \",\"  That will, O Arjuna, is tamasa, whereby insensate man does not abandon  sleep, fear, grief, despair and self-conceit.   \",\"  Hear now from Me, O Arjuna, the three kinds of pleasure.  Pleasure which is enjoyed only by repeated practice, and which puts an end to  pain,   \",\"  Which, in its inception, is as poison, but in the end as nectar, born of the  serene realization of the true nature of soul\\u2014that pleasure is said to be  sattvika.   \",\"  That pleasure is called rajasa which, arising from the contact of the senses  with their objects, is at first as nectar but in the end like poison.    \",\"  That pleasure is called tamasa which arising from sleep and sloth and  heedlessness, stupefies the soul both at first and in the end.   \",\"  There is no being, either on earth or in heaven among the gods, that can be  free from these three gunas born of prakriti.   \",\"  The duties of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras, are distributed  according to their innate qualifications, O Arjuna.   \",\"  Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness, uprightness,  knowledge and discriminative knowledge, faith in God are the Brahmana's  natural duties.   \",\"  Valour, spiritedness, constancy, resourcefulness, not fleeing from battle,  generosity, and the capacity to rule are the natural duties of a Kshatriya.   \",\"  Tilling the soil, protection of the cow and commerce are the natural  functions of a Vaishya, while service is the natural duty of a Shudra.   \",\"  Each man, by complete absorption in the performance of his duty, wins  perfection. Hear now how he wins such perfection by devotion to that duty.   \",\"  By offering the worship of his duty to Him who is the moving spirit of all  beings, and by whom all this is pervaded, man wins perfection.   \",\"  Better one's own duty, though uninviting, than another's which may be  more easily performed; doing duty which accords with one's nature, one incurs  no sin.   \",\"  One should not abandon, O Arjuna, that duty to which one is born,  imperfect though it be; for all action, in its inception, is enveloped in  imperfection, as fire in smoke.   \",\"  He who has weaned himself of all kinds, who is master of himself, who is  dead to desire, attains through renunciation the perfection of freedom from  action.   \",\"  Learn now from Me, in brief, O Arjuna, how he who has gained this  perfection, attains to Brahman, the supreme consummation of knowledge.   \",\"  Equipped with purified understanding, restraining the self with firm will,  abandoning sound and other objects of the senses, putting aside likes and  dislikes,   \",\"  Living in solitude, spare in diet, restrained in speech, body and mind, ever  absorbed in dhyanayoga, anchored in dispassion,   \",\"  Without pride, violence, arrogance, lust, wrath, possession, having shed all  sense of \\u2018mine' and at peace with himself, he is fit to become one with Brahman.   \",\"  One with Brahman and at peace with himself, he grieves not, nor desires;  holding all beings alike, he achieves supreme devotion to Me.   \",\"  By devotion, he realizes in truth how great I am, who I am; and having  known Me in reality he enters into Me.   \",\"  Even whilst always performing actions, he who makes Me his refuge wins,  by My grace, the eternal and imperishable haven.   \",\"  Casting, with your mind, all actions on Me, make Me your goal, and resorting  to the yoga of even-mindedness fix your thought ever on Me.   \",\"  Fixing his your thought on Me, you shall surmount all obstacles by My  grace; but if possessed by the sense of \\u2018I' you listen not, you shall perish.   \",\"  If obsessed by the sense of \\u2018I', you thinks, \\u2018I will not fight', vain is your  obsession; (thy) nature will compel you.   \",\"  What you will not do, O Arjuna, because of your delusion, you shall do,  even against your will, bound as you are by the duty to which you are born.   \",\"  God, O Arjuna, dwells in the heart of every being and by His delusive  mystery whirls them all, (as though) set on a machine.   \",\"  In Him alone seek your refuge with all your heart, O Arjuna. By His grace  shall you win to the eternal haven of supreme peace.   \",\"  Thus have I expounded to you the most mysterious of all knowledge;  ponder over it fully, then act as you will.   \",\"  Hear again My supreme word, the most mysterious of all; dearly beloved  you are of Me, hence I desire to declare your welfare.   \",\"  On Me fix your mind, to Me bring your devotion, to Me offer your sacrifice, to  Me make your obeisance; to Me indeed shall you come\\u2014solemn is My promise  to you, you are dear to Me.    \",\"  Abandon all duties and come to Me the only refuge. I will release you from  all sins; grieve not!   \",\"  Utter this never to him who knows no austerity, has no devotion, nor any  desire to listen, nor yet to him who scoffs at Me.   \",\"  He who will propound this supreme mystery to My devotees, shall, by that  act of highest devotion to Me, surely come to Me.   \",\"  Nor among men is there any who renders dearer service to Me than he; nor  shall there be on earth any more beloved by Me than he.   \",\"  And the man of faith who, scorning not, will but listen to it,\\u2014even he shall  be released and will go to the happy worlds of men of virtuous deeds.   \",\"  Have you heard this, O Arjuna, with a concentrated mind? Has your delusion,  born of ignorance, been destroyed, O Arjuna?  Arjuna Said:   \",\"  Thanks to Your grace, O Krishna, my delusion is destroyed, my  understanding has returned. I stand secure, my doubts all dispelled; I will do  your bidding.  Sanjaya Said:   \",\"  Thus did I hear this marvellous and thrilling discourse between Krishna  and the great-souled Arjuna.   \",\"  It was by Vyasa's favor that I listened to this supreme and mysterious Yoga  as expounded by the lips of the Master of Yoga, Krishna Himself.   \",\"  O King, as often as I recall that marvellous and purifying discourse between  Krishna and Arjuna, I am filled with recurring rapture.   \",\"  And as often as I recall that marvellous form of Krishna, my wonder knows no  bounds and I rejoice again and again.   \",\"  Wheresoever Krishna, the Master of Yoga, is, and wheresoever is Arjuna the  Bowman, there rest assured are Fortune, Victory, Prosperity, and Eternal Right.\",\"\\u201cArjuna questioned: My Lord! If Wisdom is above action, why do You advise me to engage in this terrible fight? \",\" Your language perplexes me and confuses my reason. Therefore please tell me the only way by which I may, without doubt, secure my spiritual welfare. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: In this world, as I have said, there is a twofold path, O Sinless One! There is the Path of Wisdom for those who meditate, and the Path of Action for those who work. \",\" No man can attain freedom from activity by refraining from action; nor can he reach perfection by merely refusing to act. \",\" He cannot even for a moment remain really inactive, for the Qualities of Nature will compel him to act whether he will or no. \",\" He who remains motionless, refusing to act, but all the while brooding over sensuous object, that deluded soul is simply a hypocrite. \",\" But, O Arjuna! All honour to him whose mind controls his senses, for he is thereby beginning to practise Karma-Yoga, the Path of Right Action, keeping himself always unattached. \",\" Do your duty as prescribed, for action for duty\\u2019s sake is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of the body would be impossible if man remained inactive. \",\" In this world people are fettered by action, unless it is performed as a sacrifice. Therefore, O Arjuna, let your acts be done without attachment, as sacrifice only. \",\" In the beginning, when God created all beings by the sacrifice of Himself, He said unto them: `Through sacrifice you can procreate, and it shall satisfy all your desires. \",\" Worship the Powers of Nature thereby, and let them nourish you in return; thus supporting each other, you shall attain your highest welfare. \",\" For, fed, on sacrifice, nature will give you all the enjoyment you can desire. But he who enjoys what she gives without returning is, indeed, a robber.\\u2019 \",\" The sages who enjoy the food that remains after the sacrifice is made are freed from all sin; but the selfish who spread their feast only for themselves feed on sin only. \",\" All creatures are the product of food, food is the product of rain, rain comes by sacrifice, and sacrifice is the noblest form of action. \",\" All action originates in the Supreme Spirit, which is Imperishable, and in sacrificial action the all-pervading Spirit is consciously present. \",\" Thus he who does not help the revolving wheel of sacrifice, but instead leads a sinful life, rejoicing in the gratification of his senses, O Arjuna, he breathes in vain. \",\" On the other hand, the soul who meditates on the Self is content to serve the Self and rests satisfied within the Self; there remains nothing more for him to accomplish. \",\" He has nothing to gain by the performance or non-performance of action. His welfare depends not on any contribution that an earthly creature can make. \",\" Therefore do your duty perfectly, without care for the results, for he who does his duty disinterestedly attains the Supreme. \",\" King Janaka and others attained perfection through action alone. Even for the sake of enlightening the world, it is your duty to act; \",\" For whatever a great man does, others imitate. People conform to the standard which he has set. \",\" There is nothing in this universe, O Arjuna, that I am compelled to do, nor anything for Me to attain; yet I am persistently active. \",\" For were I not to act without ceasing, O prince, people would be glad to do likewise. \",\" And if I were to refrain from action, the human race would be ruined; I should lead the world to chaos, and destruction would follow. \",\" As the ignorant act, because of their fondness for action, so should the wise act without such attachment, fixing their eyes, O Arjuna, only on the welfare of the world. \",\" But a wise man should not perturb the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to action; let him perform his own actions in the right spirit, with concentration on Me, thus inspiring all to do the same. \",\" Action is the product of the Qualities inherent in Nature. It is only the ignorant man who, misled by personal egotism, says: `I am the doer.\\u2019 \",\" But he, O Mighty One, who understands correctly the relation of the Qualities to action, is not attached to the act for he perceives that it is merely the action and reaction of the Qualities among themselves. \",\" Those who do not understand the Qualities are interested in the act. Still, the wise man who knows the truth should not disturb the mind of him who does not. \",\" Therefore, surrendering your actions unto Me, your thoughts concentrated on the Absolute, free from selfishness and without anticipation of reward, with mind devoid of excitement, begin you to fight. \",\" Those who always act in accordance with My precepts, firm in faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from the bondage of action. \",\" But they who ridicule My word and do not keep it, are ignorant, devoid of wisdom and blind. They seek but their own destruction. \",\" Even the wise man acts in character with his nature; indeed, all creatures act according to their natures. What is the use of compulsion then? \",\" The love and hate which are aroused by the objects of sense arise from Nature; do not yield to them. They only obstruct the path. \",\" It is better to do yours own duty, however lacking in merit, than to do that of another, even though efficiently. It is better to die doing one\\u2019s own duty, for to do the duty of another is fraught with danger. \",\" Arjuna asked: My Lord! Tell me, what is it that drives a man to sin, even against his will and as if by compulsion? \",\" Lord Shri Krishna: It is desire, it is aversion, born of passion. Desire consumes and corrupts everything. It is man\\u2019s greatest enemy. \",\" As fire is shrouded in smoke, a mirror by dust and a child by the womb, so is the universe enveloped in desire. \",\" It is the wise man\\u2019s constant enemy; it tarnishes the face of wisdom. It is as insatiable as a flame of fire. \",\" It works through the senses, the mind and the reason; and with their help destroys wisdom and confounds the soul. \",\" Therefore, O Arjuna, first control your senses and then slay desire, for it is full of sin, and is the destroyer of knowledge and of wisdom. \",\" It is said that the senses are powerful. But beyond the senses is the mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, and beyond and greater than intellect is He. \",\" Thus, O Mighty-in-Arms, knowing Him to be beyond the intellect and, by His help, subduing your personal egotism, kill yours enemy, Desire, extremely difficult though it be.\\u201d \",\"The King Dhritarashtra asked: \\u201cO Sanjaya! What happened on the sacred battlefield of Kurukshetra, when my people gathered against the Pandavas?\\u201d \",\" Sanjaya replied: \\u201cThe Prince Duryodhana, when he saw the army of the Pandavas paraded, approached his preceptor Guru Drona and spoke as follows: \",\" Revered Father! Behold this mighty host of the Pandavas, paraded by the son of King Drupada, your wise disciple. \",\" In it are heroes and great bowmen; the equals in battle of Arjuna and Bheema, Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada, great soldiers all; \",\" Dhrishtaketu, Chekitan, the valiant King of Benares, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, Shaibya \\u2013 a master over many; \",\" Yudhamanyu, Uttamouja, Soubhadra and the sons of Droupadi, famous men. \",\" Further, take note of all those captains who have ranged themselves on our side, O best of Spiritual Guides! The leaders of my army. I will name them for you. \",\" You come first; then Bheeshma, Karna, Kripa, great soldiers; Ashwaththama, Vikarna and the son of Somadhatta; \",\" And many others, all ready to die for my sake; all armed, all skilled in war. \",\" Yet our army seems the weaker, though commanded by Bheeshma; their army seems the stronger, though commanded by Bheema. \",\" Therefore in the rank and file, let stand firm in their posts, according to battalions; and all you generals about Bheeshma. \",\" Then to enliven his spirits, the brave Grandfather Bheeshma, eldest of the Kuru-clan, blew his conch, till it sounded like a lion\\u2019s roar. \",\" And immediately all the conches and drums, the trumpets and horns, blared forth in tumultuous uproar. \",\" Then seated in their spacious war chariot, yoked with white horses, Lord Shri Krishna and Arjuna sounded their divine shells. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna blew his Panchajanya and Arjuna his Devadatta, brave Bheema his renowned shell, Poundra. \",\" The King Dharmaraja, the son of Kunti, blew the Anantavijaya, Nakalu and Sahadeo, the Sugosh and Manipushpaka, respectively. \",\" And the Maharaja of Benares, the great archer, Shikhandi, the great soldier, Dhrishtayumna, Virata and Satyaki, the invincible, \",\" And O King! Drupada, the sons of Droupadi and Soubhadra, the great soldier, blew their conches. \",\" The tumult rent the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra, and violently shook heaven and earth with its echo. \",\" Then beholding the sons of Dhritarashtra, drawn up on the battle- field, ready to fight, Arjuna, whose flag bore the Hanuman, \",\" Raising his bow, spoke this to the Lord Shri Krishna: O Infallible! Lord of the earth! Please draw up my chariot between the two armies, \",\" So that I may observe those who must fight on my side, those who must fight against me; \",\" And gaze over this array of soldiers, eager to please the sinful sons of Dhritarashtra.\\u201d \",\" Sanjaya said: \\u201cHaving listened to the request of Arjuna, Lord Shri Krishna drew up His bright chariot exactly in the midst between the two armies, \",\" Where Bheeshma and Drona had led all the rulers of the earth, and spoke thus: O Arjuna! Behold these members of the family of Kuru assembled. \",\" There Arjuna noticed fathers, grandfathers, uncles, cousins, sons, grandsons, teachers, friends; \",\" Fathers-in-law and benefactors, arrayed on both sides. Arjuna then gazed at all those kinsmen before him. \",\" And his heart melted with pity and sadly he spoke: O my Lord! When I see all these, my own people, thirsting for battle, \",\" My limbs fail me and my throat is parched, my body trembles and my hair stands on end. \",\" The bow Gandeeva slips from my hand, and my skin burns. I cannot keep quiet, for my mind is in tumult. \",\" The omens are adverse; what good can come from the slaughter of my people on this battlefield? \",\" Ah my Lord! I crave not for victory, nor for the kingdom, nor for any pleasure. What were a kingdom or happiness or life to me, \",\" When those for whose sake I desire these things stand here about to sacrifice their property and their lives: \",\" Teachers, fathers and grandfathers, sons and grandsons, uncles, father-in-law, brothers-inlaw and other relatives. \",\" I would not kill them, even for three worlds; why then for this poor earth? It matters not if I myself am killed. \",\" My Lord! What happiness can come from the death of these sons of Dhritarashtra? We shall sin if we kill these desperate men. \",\" We are worthy of a nobler feat than to slaughter our relatives \\u2013 the sons of Dhritarashtra; for, my Lord, how can we be happy of we kill our kinsmen? \",\" Although these men, blinded by greed, see no guilt in destroying their kin, or fighting against their friends \",\" Should not we, whose eyes are open, who consider it to be wrong to annihilate our house, turn away from so great a crime? \",\" The destruction of our kindred means the destruction of the traditions of our ancient lineage, and when these are lost, irreligion will overrun our homes. \",\" When irreligion spreads, the women of the house begin to stray; when they lose their purity, adulteration of the stock follows. \",\" Promiscuity ruins both the family and those who defile it; while the souls of our ancestors droop, through lack of the funeral cakes and ablutions. \",\" By the destruction of our lineage and the pollution of blood, ancient class traditions and family purity alike perish. \",\" The wise say, my Lord, that they are forever lost, whose ancient traditions are lost. \",\" Alas, it is strange that we should be willing to kill our own countrymen and commit a great sin, in order to enjoy the pleasures of a kingdom. \",\" If, on the contrary, the sons of Dhritarashtra, with weapons in their hand, should slay me, unarmed and unresisting, surely that would be better for my welfare!\\u201d \",\" Sanjaya said: \\u201cHaving spoken thus, in the midst of the armies, Arjuna sank on the seat of the chariot, casting away his bow and arrow; heartbroken with grief.\\u201d \",\"Sanjaya then told how the Lord Shri Krishna, seeing Arjuna overwhelmed with compassion, his eyes dimmed with flowing tears and full of despondency, consoled him: \",\" \\u201cThe Lord said: My beloved friend! Why yield, just on the eve of battle, to this weakness which does no credit to those who call themselves Aryans, and only brings them infamy and bars against them the gates of heaven? \",\" O Arjuna! Why give way to unmanliness? O you who are the terror of yours enemies! Shake off such shameful effeminacy, make ready to act! \",\" Arjuna argued: My Lord! How can I, when the battle rages, send an arrow through Bheeshma and Drona, who should receive my reverence? \",\" Rather would I content myself with a beggar\\u2019s crust that kill these teachers of mine, these precious noble souls! To slay these masters who are my benefactors would be to stain the sweetness of life\\u2019s pleasures with their blood. \",\" Nor can I say whether it were better that they conquer me or for me to conquer them, since I would no longer care to live if I killed these sons of Dhritarashtra, now preparing for fight. \",\" My heart is oppressed with pity; and my mind confused as to what my duty is. Therefore, my Lord, tell me what is best for my spiritual welfare, for I am Your disciple. Please direct me, I pray. \",\" For should I attain the monarchy of the visible world, or over the invisible world, it would not drive away the anguish which is now paralysing my senses.\\u201d \",\" Sanjaya continued: \\u201cArjuna, the conqueror of all enemies, then told the Lord of All-Hearts that he would no fight, and became silent, O King! \",\" Thereupon the Lord, with a gracious smile, addressed him who was so much depressed in the midst of the two armies. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna said: Why grieve for those for whom no grief is due, and yet profess wisdom? The wise grieve neither for the dead nor the living. \",\" There was never a time when I was not, nor you, nor these princes were not; there will never be a time when we shall cease to be. \",\" As the soul experiences in this body infancy, youth and old age, so finally it passes into another. The wise have no delusion about this. \",\" Those external relations which bring cold and heat, pain and happiness, they come and go; they are not permanent. Endure them bravely, O Prince! \",\" The hero whose soul is unmoved by circumstance, who accepts pleasure and pain with equanimity, only he is fit for immortality. \",\" That which is not, shall never be; that which is, shall never cease to be. To the wise, these truths are self-evident. \",\" The Spirit, which pervades all that we see, is imperishable. Nothing can destroy the Spirit. \",\" The material bodies which this Eternal, Indestructible, Immeasurable Spirit inhabits are all finite. Therefore fight, O Valiant Man! \",\" He who thinks that the Spirit kills, and he who thinks of It as killed, are both ignorant. The Spirit kills not, nor is It killed. \",\" It was not born; It will never die, nor once having been, can It cease to be. Unborn, Eternal, Ever-enduring, yet Most Ancient, the Spirit dies not when the body is dead. \",\" He who knows the Spirit as Indestructible, Immortal, Unborn, Always-the-Same, how should he kill or cause to be killed? \",\" As a man discards his threadbare robes and puts on new, so the Spirit throws off Its wornout bodies and takes fresh ones. \",\" Weapons cleave It not, fire burns It not, water drenches It not, and wind dries It not. \",\" It is impenetrable; It can be neither drowned nor scorched nor dried. It is Eternal, Allpervading, Unchanging, Immovable and Most Ancient. \",\" It is named the Unmanifest, the Unthinkable, the immutable. Wherefore, knowing the Spirit as such, you have no cause to grieve. \",\" Even if you think of It as constantly being born, constantly dying, even then, O Mighty Man, you still have no cause to grieve. \",\" For death is as sure for that which is born, as birth is for that which is dead. Therefore grieve not for what is inevitable. \",\" The end and the beginning of beings are unknown. We see only the intervening formations. Then what cause is there for grief? \",\" One hears of the Spirit with surprise, another thinks It marvellous, the third listens without comprehending. Thus, though many are told about It, scarcely is there one who knows It. \",\" Be not anxious about these armies. The Spirit in man is imperishable. \",\" You must look at your duty. Nothing can be more welcome to a soldier than a righteous war. Therefore to waver in this resolve is unworthy, O Arjuna! \",\" Blessed are the soldiers who find their opportunity. This opportunity has opened for you the gates of heaven. \",\" Refuse to fight in this righteous cause, and you will be a traitor, lost to fame, incurring only sin. \",\" Men will talk forever of your disgrace; and to the noble, dishonour is worse than death. \",\" Great generals will think that you have fled from the battlefield through cowardice; though once honoured you will seem despicable. \",\" Yours enemies will spread scandal and mock at your courage. Can anything be more humiliating? \",\" If killed, you shall attain Heaven; if victorious, enjoy the kingdom of earth. Therefore arise, O Son of Kunti, and fight! \",\" Look upon pleasure and pain, victory and defeat, with an equal eye. Make ready for the combat, and you shall commit no sin. \",\" I have told you the philosophy of Knowledge. Now listen and I will explain the philosophy of Action, by means of which, O Arjuna, you shall break through the bondage of all action. \",\" On this Path, endeavour is never wasted, nor can it ever be repressed. Even a very little of its practice protects one from great danger. \",\" By its means, the straying intellect becomes steadied in the contemplation of one object only; whereas the minds of the irresolute stray into bypaths innumerable. \",\" Only the ignorant speak in figurative language. It is they who extol the letter of the scriptures, saying, `There is nothing deeper than this.\\u2019 \",\" Consulting only their own desires, they construct their own heaven, devising arduous and complex rites to secure their own pleasure and their own power; and the only result is rebirth. \",\" While their minds are absorbed with ideas of power and personal enjoyment, they cannot concentrate their discrimination on one point. \",\" The Vedic Scriptures tell of the three constituents of life \\u2013 the Qualities. Rise above all of them, O Arjuna, above all the pairs of opposing sensations; be steady in truth, free from worldly anxieties and centered in the Self. \",\" As a man can drink water from any side of a full tank, so the skilled theologian can wrest from any scripture that which will serve his purpose. \",\" But you have only the right to work, but none to the fruit thereof. Let not then the fruit of your action be your motive; nor yet be you enamored of inaction. \",\" Perform all your actions with mind concentrated on the Divine, renouncing attachment and looking upon success and failure with an equal eye. Spirituality implies equanimity. \",\" Physical action is far inferior to an intellect concentrated on the Divine. Have recourse then to Pure Intelligence. It is only the petty-minded who work for reward. \",\" When a man attains to Pure Reason, he renounces in this world the results of good and evil alike. Cling you to Right Action. Spirituality is the real are of living. \",\" The sages guided by Pure Intellect renounce the fruit of action; and, freed from the chains of rebirth, they reach the highest bliss. \",\" When your reason has crossed the entanglements of illusion, then shall you become indifferent both to the philosophies you have heard and to those you may yet hear. \",\" When the intellect, bewildered by the multiplicity of holy scripts, stands unperturbed in blissful contemplation of the Infinite, then have you attained Spirituality. \",\" Arjuna asked: My Lord! How can we recognise the saint who has attained Pure Intellect, who has reached this state of Bliss, and whose mind is steady? how does he talk, how does he live, and how does he act? \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: When a man has given up the desires of his heart and is satisfied with the Self alone, be sure that he has reached the highest state. \",\" The sage, whose mind is unruffled in suffering, whose desire is not roused by enjoyment, who is without attachment, anger or fear \\u2013 take him to be one who stands at that lofty level. \",\" He who wherever he goes is attached to no person and to no place by ties of flesh; who accepts good and evil alike, neither welcoming the one nor shrinking from the other \\u2013 take him to be one who is merged in the Infinite. \",\" He who can withdraw his senses from the attraction of their objects, as the tortoise draws his limbs within its shell \\u2013 take it that such a one has attained Perfection. \",\" The objects of sense turn from him who is abstemious. Even the relish for them is lost in him who has seen the Truth. \",\" O Arjuna! The mind of him, who is trying to conquer it, is forcibly carried away in spite of his efforts, by his tumultuous senses. \",\" Restraining them all, let him meditate steadfastly on Me; for who thus conquers his senses achieves perfection. \",\" When a man dwells on the objects of sense, he creates an attraction for them; attraction develops into desire, and desire breeds anger. \",\" Anger induces delusion; delusion, loss of memory; through loss of memory, reason is shattered; and loss of reason leads to destruction. \",\" But the self-controlled soul, who moves amongst sense objects, free from either attachment or repulsion, he wins eternal Peace. \",\" Having attained Peace, he becomes free from misery; for when the mind gains peace, right discrimination follows. \",\" Right discrimination is not for him who cannot concentrate. Without concentration, there cannot be meditation; he who cannot meditate must not expect peace; and without peace, how can anyone expect happiness? \",\" As a ship at sea is tossed by the tempest, so the reason is carried away by the mind when preyed upon by straying senses. \",\" Therefore, O Might-in-Arms, he who keeps his senses detached from their objects \\u2013 take it that his reason is purified. \",\" The saint is awake when the world sleeps, and he ignores that for which the world lives. \",\" He attains Peace, into whom desires flow as rivers into the ocean, which though brimming with water remains ever the same; not he whom desire carries away. \",\" He attains Peace who, giving up desire, moves through the world without aspiration, possessing nothing which he can call his own, and free from pride. \",\" O Arjuna! This is the state of the Self, the Supreme Spirit, to which if a man once attain, it shall never be taken from him. Even at the time of leaving the body, he will remain firmly enthroned there, and will become one with the Eternal.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cArjuna questioned: My Lord! If Wisdom is above action, why do You advise me to engage in this terrible fight? \",\" Your language perplexes me and confuses my reason. Therefore please tell me the only way by which I may, without doubt, secure my spiritual welfare. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: In this world, as I have said, there is a twofold path, O Sinless One! There is the Path of Wisdom for those who meditate, and the Path of Action for those who work. \",\" No man can attain freedom from activity by refraining from action; nor can he reach perfection by merely refusing to act. \",\" He cannot even for a moment remain really inactive, for the Qualities of Nature will compel him to act whether he will or no. \",\" He who remains motionless, refusing to act, but all the while brooding over sensuous object, that deluded soul is simply a hypocrite. \",\" But, O Arjuna! All honour to him whose mind controls his senses, for he is thereby beginning to practise Karma-Yoga, the Path of Right Action, keeping himself always unattached. \",\" Do your duty as prescribed, for action for duty\\u2019s sake is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of the body would be impossible if man remained inactive. \",\" In this world people are fettered by action, unless it is performed as a sacrifice. Therefore, O Arjuna, let your acts be done without attachment, as sacrifice only. \",\" In the beginning, when God created all beings by the sacrifice of Himself, He said unto them: `Through sacrifice you can procreate, and it shall satisfy all your desires. \",\" Worship the Powers of Nature thereby, and let them nourish you in return; thus supporting each other, you shall attain your highest welfare. \",\" For, fed, on sacrifice, nature will give you all the enjoyment you can desire. But he who enjoys what she gives without returning is, indeed, a robber.\\u2019 \",\" The sages who enjoy the food that remains after the sacrifice is made are freed from all sin; but the selfish who spread their feast only for themselves feed on sin only. \",\" All creatures are the product of food, food is the product of rain, rain comes by sacrifice, and sacrifice is the noblest form of action. \",\" All action originates in the Supreme Spirit, which is Imperishable, and in sacrificial action the all-pervading Spirit is consciously present. \",\" Thus he who does not help the revolving wheel of sacrifice, but instead leads a sinful life, rejoicing in the gratification of his senses, O Arjuna, he breathes in vain. \",\" On the other hand, the soul who meditates on the Self is content to serve the Self and rests satisfied within the Self; there remains nothing more for him to accomplish. \",\" He has nothing to gain by the performance or non-performance of action. His welfare depends not on any contribution that an earthly creature can make. \",\" Therefore do your duty perfectly, without care for the results, for he who does his duty disinterestedly attains the Supreme. \",\" King Janaka and others attained perfection through action alone. Even for the sake of enlightening the world, it is your duty to act; \",\" For whatever a great man does, others imitate. People conform to the standard which he has set. \",\" There is nothing in this universe, O Arjuna, that I am compelled to do, nor anything for Me to attain; yet I am persistently active. \",\" For were I not to act without ceasing, O prince, people would be glad to do likewise. \",\" And if I were to refrain from action, the human race would be ruined; I should lead the world to chaos, and destruction would follow. \",\" As the ignorant act, because of their fondness for action, so should the wise act without such attachment, fixing their eyes, O Arjuna, only on the welfare of the world. \",\" But a wise man should not perturb the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to action; let him perform his own actions in the right spirit, with concentration on Me, thus inspiring all to do the same. \",\" Action is the product of the Qualities inherent in Nature. It is only the ignorant man who, misled by personal egotism, says: `I am the doer.\\u2019 \",\" But he, O Mighty One, who understands correctly the relation of the Qualities to action, is not attached to the act for he perceives that it is merely the action and reaction of the Qualities among themselves. \",\" Those who do not understand the Qualities are interested in the act. Still, the wise man who knows the truth should not disturb the mind of him who does not. \",\" Therefore, surrendering your actions unto Me, your thoughts concentrated on the Absolute, free from selfishness and without anticipation of reward, with mind devoid of excitement, begin you to fight. \",\" Those who always act in accordance with My precepts, firm in faith and without cavilling, they too are freed from the bondage of action. \",\" But they who ridicule My word and do not keep it, are ignorant, devoid of wisdom and blind. They seek but their own destruction. \",\" Even the wise man acts in character with his nature; indeed, all creatures act according to their natures. What is the use of compulsion then? \",\" The love and hate which are aroused by the objects of sense arise from Nature; do not yield to them. They only obstruct the path. \",\" It is better to do yours own duty, however lacking in merit, than to do that of another, even though efficiently. It is better to die doing one\\u2019s own duty, for to do the duty of another is fraught with danger. \",\" Arjuna asked: My Lord! Tell me, what is it that drives a man to sin, even against his will and as if by compulsion? \",\" Lord Shri Krishna: It is desire, it is aversion, born of passion. Desire consumes and corrupts everything. It is man\\u2019s greatest enemy. \",\" As fire is shrouded in smoke, a mirror by dust and a child by the womb, so is the universe enveloped in desire. \",\" It is the wise man\\u2019s constant enemy; it tarnishes the face of wisdom. It is as insatiable as a flame of fire. \",\" It works through the senses, the mind and the reason; and with their help destroys wisdom and confounds the soul. \",\" Therefore, O Arjuna, first control your senses and then slay desire, for it is full of sin, and is the destroyer of knowledge and of wisdom. \",\" It is said that the senses are powerful. But beyond the senses is the mind, beyond the mind is the intellect, and beyond and greater than intellect is He. \",\" Thus, O Mighty-in-Arms, knowing Him to be beyond the intellect and, by His help, subduing your personal egotism, kill yours enemy, Desire, extremely difficult though it be.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cLord Shri Krishna said: This imperishable philosophy I taught to Viwaswana, the founder of the Sun dynasty, Viwaswana gave it to Manu the lawgiver, and Manu to King Ikshwaku! \",\" The Divine Kings knew it, for it was their tradition. Then, after a long time, at last it was forgotten. \",\" It is the same ancient Path that I have now revealed to you, since you are My devotee and My friend. It is the supreme Secret. \",\" Arjuna asked: My Lord! Viwaswana was born before You; how then can You have revealed it to him? \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: I have been born again and again, from time to time; you too, O Arjuna! My births are known to Me, but you know not yours. \",\" I have no beginning. Though I am imperishable, as well as Lord of all that exists, yet by My own will and power do I manifest Myself. \",\" Whenever spirituality decays and materialism is rampant, then, O Arjuna, I reincarnate Myself! \",\" To protect the righteous, to destroy the wicked and to establish the kingdom of God, I am reborn from age to age. \",\" He who realises the divine truth concerning My birth and life is not born again; and when he leaves his body, he becomes one with Me. \",\" Many have merged their existences in Mine, being freed from desire, fear and anger, filled always with Me and purified by the illuminating flame of self-abnegation. \",\" Howsoever men try to worship Me, so do I welcome them. By whatever path they travel, it leads to Me at last. \",\" Those who look for success, worship the Powers; and in this world their actions bear immediate fruit. \",\" The four divisions of society (the wise, the soldier, the merchant, the labourer) were created by Me, according to the natural distribution of Qualities and instincts. I am the author of them, though I Myself do no action, and am changeless. \",\" My actions do not fetter Me, nor do I desire anything that they can bring. He who thus realises Me is not enslaved by action. \",\" In the light of wisdom, our ancestors, who sought deliverance, performed their acts. Act you also, as did our fathers of old. \",\" What is action and what is inaction? It is a question which has bewildered the wise. But I will declare unto you the philosophy of action, and knowing it, you shall be free from evil. \",\" It is necessary to consider what is right action, what is wrong action, and what is inaction, for mysterious is the law of action. \",\" He who can see inaction in action, and action in inaction, is the wisest among men. He is a saint, even though he still acts. \",\" The wise call him a sage, for whatever he undertakes is free from the motive of desire, and his deeds are purified by the fire of Wisdom. \",\" Having surrendered all claim to the results of his actions, always contented and independent, in reality he does nothing, even though he is apparently acting. \",\" Expecting nothing, his mind and personality controlled, without greed, doing bodily actions only; though he acts, yet he remains untainted. \",\" Content with what comes to him without effort of his own, mounting above the pairs of opposites, free from envy, his mind balanced both in success and failure; though he acts, yet the consequences do not bind him. \",\" He who is without attachment, free, his mind centered in wisdom, his actions, being done as a sacrifice, leave no trace behind. \",\" For him, the sacrifice itself is the Spirit; the Spirit and the oblation are one; it is the Spirit Itself which is sacrificed in Its own fire, and the man even in action is united with God, since while performing his act, his mind never ceases to be fixed on Him. \",\" Some sages sacrifice to the Powers; others offer themselves on the alter of the Eternal. \",\" Some sacrifice their physical senses in the fire of self-control; others offer up their contact with external objects in the sacrificial fire of their senses. \",\" Other again sacrifice their activities and their vitality in the Spiritual fire of selfabnegation, kindled by wisdom. \",\" And yet others offer as their sacrifice wealth, austerities and meditation. Monks wedded to their vows renounce their scriptural learning and even their spiritual powers. \",\" There are some who practise control of the Vital Energy and govern the subtle forces of Prana and Apana, thereby sacrificing their Prana unto Apana, or their Apana unto Prana. \",\" Others, controlling their diet, sacrifice their worldly life to the spiritual fire. All understand the principal of sacrifice, and by its means their sins are washed away. \",\" Tasting the nectar of immortality, as the reward of sacrifice, they reach the Eternal. This world is not for those who refuse to sacrifice; much less the other world. \",\" In this way other sacrifices too may be undergone for the Spirit\\u2019s sake. Know you that they all depend on action. Knowing this, you shall be free. \",\" The sacrifice of wisdom is superior to any material sacrifice, for, O Arjuna, the climax of action is always Realisation. \",\" This shall you learn by prostrating yourself at the Master\\u2019s feet, by questioning Him and by serving Him. The wise who have realised the Truth will teach you wisdom. \",\" Having known That, you shall never again be confounded; and, O Arjuna, by the power of that wisdom, you shall see all these people as if they were yours own Self, and therefore as Me. \",\" Be you the greatest of sinners, yet you shall cross over all sin by the ferryboat of wisdom. \",\" As the kindled fire consumes the fuel, so, O Arjuna, in the flame of wisdom the embers of action are burnt to ashes. \",\" There is nothing in the world so purifying as wisdom; and he who is a perfect saint finds that at last in his own Self. \",\" He who is full of faith attains wisdom, and he too who can control his senses, having attained that wisdom, he shall before long attain Supreme Peace. \",\" But the ignorant man, and he who has no faith, and the sceptic are lost. Neither in this world nor elsewhere is there any happiness in store for him who always doubts. \",\" But the man who has renounced his action for meditation, who has cleft his doubt in two by the sword of wisdom, who remains always enthroned in his Self, is not bound by his acts. \",\" Therefore, cleaving apart with the sword of wisdom the doubts of the heart, which yours own ignorance has engendered, follow the Path of Wisdom and arise!\\u201d \",\"\\u201cArjuna said: My Lord! At one moment You praise renunciation of action; at another, right action. Tell me truly, I pray, which of these is the more conducive to my highest welfare? \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: Renunciation of action and the path of right action both lead to the highest; of the two, right action is the better. \",\" He is a true ascetic who never desires or dislikes, who is uninfluenced by the opposites and is easily freed from bondage. \",\" Only the unenlightened speak of wisdom and right action as separate, not the wise. If any man knows one, he enjoys the fruit of both. \",\" The level which is reached by wisdom is attained through right action as well. He who perceives that the two are one, knows the truth. \",\" Without concentration, O Mighty Man, renunciation is difficult. But the sage who is always meditating on the Divine, before long shall attain the Absolute. \",\" He who is spiritual, who is pure, who has overcome his senses and his personal self, who has realised his highest Self as the Self of all, such a one, even though he acts, is not bound by his acts. \",\" Though the saint sees, hears, touches, smells, eats, moves, sleeps and breathes, yet he knows the Truth, and he knows that it is not he who acts. \",\" Though he talks, though he gives and receives, though he opens his eyes and shuts them, he still knows that his senses are merely disporting themselves among the objects of perception. \",\" He who dedicates his actions to the Spirit, without any personal attachment to them, he is no more tainted by sin than the water lily is wetted by water. \",\" The sage performs his action dispassionately, using his body, mind and intellect, and even his senses, always as a means of purification. \",\" Having abandoned the fruit of action, he wins eternal peace. Others unacquainted with spirituality, led by desire and clinging to the benefit which they think will follow their actions, become entangled in them. \",\" Mentally renouncing all actions, the self-controlled soul enjoys bliss in this body, the city of the nine gates, neither doing anything himself nor causing anything to be done. \",\" The Lord of this universe has not ordained activity, or any incentive thereto, or any relation between an act and its consequences. All this is the work of Nature. \",\" The Lord does not accept responsibility for any man\\u2019s sin or merit. Men are deluded because in them wisdom is submerged in ignorance. \",\" Surely wisdom is like the sun, revealing the supreme truth to those whose ignorance is dispelled by the wisdom of the Self. \",\" Meditating on the Divine, having faith in the Divine, concentrating on the Divine and losing themselves in the Divine, their sins dissolved in wisdom, they go where there is no return. \",\" Sages look equally upon all, whether he be a minister of learning and humility, or an infidel, or whether it be a cow, an elephant or a dog. \",\" Even in this world they conquer their earth-life whose minds, fixed on the Supreme, remain always balanced; for the Supreme has neither blemish nor bias. \",\" He who knows and lives in the Absolute remains unmoved and unperturbed; he is not elated by pleasure or depressed by pain. \",\" He finds happiness in his own Self, and enjoys eternal bliss, whose heart does not yearn for the contacts of earth and whose Self is one with the Everlasting. \",\" The joys that spring from external associations bring pain; they have their beginning and their endings. The wise man does not rejoice in them. \",\" He who, before he leaves his body, learns to surmount the promptings of desire and anger is a saint and is happy. \",\" He who is happy within his Self and has found Its peace, and in whom the inner light shines, that sage attains Eternal Bliss and becomes the Spirit Itself. \",\" Sages whose sins have been washed away, whose sense of separateness has vanished, who have subdued themselves, and seek only the welfare of all, come to the Eternal Spirit. \",\" Saints who know their Selves, who control their minds, and feel neither desire nor anger, find Eternal Bliss everywhere. \",\" Excluding external objects, his gaze fixed between the eyebrows, the inward and outward breathings passing equally through his nostrils; \",\" Governing sense, mind and intellect, intent on liberation, free from desire, fear and anger, the sage is forever free. \",\" Knowing me as Him who gladly receives all offerings of austerity and sacrifice, as the Might Ruler of all the Worlds and the Friend of all beings, he passes to Eternal Peace.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cLord Shri Krishna said: He who acts because it is his duty, not thinking of the consequences, is really spiritual and a true ascetic; and not he who merely observes rituals or who shuns all action. \",\" O Arjuna! Renunciation is in fact what is called Right Action. No one can become spiritual who has not renounced all desire. \",\" For the sage who seeks the heights of spiritual meditation, practice is the only method, and when he has attained them, he must maintain himself there by continual self-control. \",\" When a man renounces even the thought of initiating action, when he is not interested in sense objects or any results which may flow from his acts, then in truth he understands spirituality. \",\" Let him seek liberation by the help of his Highest Self, and let him never disgrace his own Self. For that Self is his only friend; yet it may also be his enemy. \",\" To him who has conquered his lower nature by Its help, the Self is a friend, but to him who has not done so, It is an enemy. \",\" The Self of him who is self-controlled, and has attained peace is equally unmoved by heat or cold, pleasure or pain, honour or dishonour. \",\" He who desires nothing but wisdom and spiritual insight, who has conquered his senses and who looks with the same eye upon a lump of earth, a stone or fine gold, is a real saint. \",\" He looks impartially on all \\u2013 lover, friend or foe; indifferent or hostile; alien or relative; virtuous or sinful. \",\" Let the student of spirituality try unceasingly to concentrate his mind; Let him live in seclusion, absolutely alone, with mind and personality controlled, free from desire and without possessions. \",\" Having chosen a holy place, let him sit in a firm posture on a seat, neither too high nor too low, and covered with a grass mat, a deer skin and a cloth. \",\" Seated thus, his mind concentrated, its functions controlled and his senses governed, let him practise meditation for the purification of his lower nature. \",\" Let him hold body, head and neck erect, motionless and steady; let him look fixedly at the tip of his nose, turning neither to the right nor to the left. \",\" With peace in his heart and nor fear, observing the vow of celibacy, with mind controlled and fixed on Me, let the student lose himself in contemplation of Me. \",\" Thus keeping his mind always in communion with Me, and with his thoughts subdued, he shall attain that Peace which is mine and which will lead him to liberation at last. \",\" Meditation is not for him who eats too much, not for him who eats not at all; not for him who is overmuch addicted to sleep, not for him who is always awake. \",\" But for him who regulates his food and recreation, who is balanced in action, in sleep and in waking, it shall dispel all unhappiness. \",\" When the mind, completely controlled, is centered in the Self, and free from all earthly desires, then is the man truly spiritual. \",\" The wise man who has conquered his mind and is absorbed in the Self is as a lamp which does not flicker, since it stands sheltered from every wind. \",\" There, where the whole nature is seen in the light of the Self, where the man abides within his Self and is satisfied there, its functions restrained by its union with the Divine, the mind finds rest. \",\" When he enjoys the Bliss which passes sense, and which only the Pure Intellect can grasp, when he comes to rest within his own highest Self, never again will he stray from reality. \",\" Finding That, he will realise that there is no possession so precious. And when once established here, no calamity can disturb him. \",\" This inner severance from the affliction of misery is spirituality. It should be practised with determination and with a heart which refuses to be depressed. \",\" Renouncing every desire which imagination can conceive, controlling the senses at every point by the power of mind; \",\" Little by little, by the help of his reason controlled by fortitude, let him attain peace; and, fixing his mind on the Self, let him not think of any other thing. \",\" When the volatile and wavering mind would wander, let him restrain it and bring it again to its allegiance to the Self. \",\" Supreme Bliss is the lot of the sage, whose mind attains Peace, whose passions subside, who is without sin, and who becomes one with the Absolute. \",\" Thus, free from sin, abiding always in the Eternal, the saint enjoys without effort the Bliss which flows from realisation of the Infinite. \",\" He who experiences the unity of life sees his own Self in all beings, and all beings in his own Self, and looks on everything with an impartial eye; \",\" He who sees Me in everything and everything in Me, him shall I never forsake, nor shall he lose Me. \",\" The sage who realises the unity of life and who worships Me in all beings, lives in Me, whatever may be his lot. \",\" O Arjuna! He is the perfect saint who, taught by the likeness within himself, sees the same Self everywhere, whether the outer form be pleasurable or painful. \",\" Arjuna said: I do not see how I can attain this state of equanimity which You has revealed, owing to the restlessness of my mind. \",\" My Lord! Verily, the mind is fickle and turbulent, obstinate and strong, yea extremely difficult as the wind to control. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: Doubtless, O Mighty One, the mind is fickle and exceedingly difficult to restrain, but, O Son of Kunti, with practice and renunciation it can be done. \",\" It is not possible to attain Self-Realisation if a man does not know how to control himself; but for him who, striving by proper means, learns such control, it is possible. \",\" Arjuna asked: He who fails to control himself, whose mind falls from spiritual contemplation, who attains not perfection but retains his faith, what of him, my Lord? \",\" Having failed in both, my Lord, is he without hope, like a riven cloud having no support, lost on the spiritual road? \",\" My Lord! You are worthy to solve this doubt once and for all; save Yourself there is no one competent to do so. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: My beloved child! There is no destruction for him, either in this world or in the next. No evil fate awaits him who treads the path of righteousness. \",\" Having reached the worlds where the righteous dwell, and having remained there for many years, he who has slipped from the path of spirituality will be born again in the family of the pure, benevolent and prosperous. \",\" Or, he may be born in the family of the wise sages, though a birth like this is, indeed, very difficult to obtain. \",\" Then the experience acquired in his former life will revive, and with its help he will strive for perfection more eagerly than before. \",\" Unconsciously he will return to the practices of his old life; so that he who tries to realise spiritual consciousness is certainly superior to one who only talks of it. \",\" Then after many lives, the student of spirituality, who earnestly strives, and whose sins are absolved, attains perfection and reaches the Supreme. \",\" The wise man is superior to the ascetic and to the scholar and to the man of action; therefore be you a wise man, O Arjuna! \",\" I look upon him as the best of mystics who, full of faith, worshippeth Me and abides in Me.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cLord Shri Krishna said: Listen, O Arjuna! And I will tell you how you shall know Me in my Full perfection, practising meditation with your mind devoted to Me, and having Me for your refuge. \",\" I will reveal to this knowledge unto you, and how it may be realised; which, once accomplished, there remains nothing else worth having in this life. \",\" Among thousands of men scarcely one strives for perfection, and even amongst those who gain occult powers, perhaps but one knows me in truth. \",\" Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and personality; this is the eightfold division of My Manifested Nature. \",\" This is My inferior Nature; but distinct from this, O Valiant One, know you that my Superior Nature is the very Life which sustains the universe. \",\" It is the womb of all being; for I am He by Whom the worlds were created and shall be dissolved. \",\" O Arjuna! There is nothing higher than Me; all is strung upon Me as rows of pearls upon a thread. \",\" O Arjuna! I am the Fluidity in water, the Light in the sun and in the moon. I am the mystic syllable Om in the Vedic scriptures, the Sound in ether, the Virility in man. \",\" I am the Fragrance of earth, the Brilliance of fire. I am the Life Force in all beings, and I am the Austerity of the ascetics. \",\" Know, O Arjuna, that I am the eternal Seed of being; I am the Intelligence of the intelligent, the Splendour of the resplendent. \",\" I am the Strength of the strong, of them who are free from attachment and desire; and, O Arjuna, I am the Desire for righteousness. \",\" Whatever be the nature of their life, whether it be pure or passionate or ignorant, they are all derived from Me. They are in Me, but I am not in them. \",\" The inhabitants of the world, misled by those natures which the Qualities have engendered, know not that I am higher than them all, and that I do not change. \",\" Verily, this Divine Illusion of Phenomenon manifesting itself in the Qualities is difficult to surmount. Only they who devote themselves to Me and to Me alone can accomplish it. \",\" The sinner, the ignorant, the vile, deprived of spiritual perception by the glamour of Illusion, and he who pursues a godless life \\u2013 none of them shall find Me. \",\" O Arjuna! The righteous who worship Me are grouped by stages: first, they who suffer, next they who desire knowledge, then they who thirst after truth, and lastly they who attain wisdom. \",\" Of all of these, he who has gained wisdom, who meditates on Me without ceasing, devoting himself only to Me, he is the best; for by the wise man I am exceedingly beloved and the wise man, too, is beloved by Me. \",\" Noble-minded are they all, but the wise man I hold as my own Self; for he, remaining always at peace with Me, makes me his final goal. \",\" After many lives, at last the wise man realises Me as I am. A man so enlightened that he sees God everywhere is very difficult to find. \",\" They in whom wisdom is obscured by one desire or the other, worship the lesser Powers, practising many rites which vary according to their temperaments. \",\" But whatever the form of worship, if the devotee have faith, then upon his faith in that worship do I set My own seal. \",\" If he worships one form alone with real faith, then shall his desires be fulfilled through that only; for thus have I ordained. \",\" The fruit that comes to men of limited insight is, after all, finite. They who worship the Lower Powers attain them; but those who worship Me come unto Me alone. \",\" The ignorant think of Me, who am the Unmanifested Spirit, as if I were really in human form. They do not understand that My Superior Nature is changeless and most excellent. \",\" I am not visible to all, for I am enveloped by the illusion of Phenomenon. This deluded world does not know Me as the Unborn and the Imperishable. \",\" I know, O Arjuna, all beings in the past, the present and the future; but they do not know Me. \",\" O brave Arjuna! Man lives in a fairy world, deceived by the glamour of opposite sensations, infatuated by desire and aversion. \",\" But those who act righteously, in whom sin has been destroyed, who are free from the infatuation of the conflicting emotions, they worship Me with firm resolution. \",\" Those who make Me their refuge, who strive for liberation from decay and Death, they realise the Supreme Spirit, which is their own real Self, and in which all action finds its consummation. \",\" Those who see Me in the life of the world, in the universal sacrifice, and as pure Divinity, keeping their minds steady, they live in Me, even in the crucial hour of death.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cArjuna asked: O Lord of Lords! What is that which men call the Supreme Spirit, what is man\\u2019s Spiritual Nature, and what is the Law? What is Matter and what is Divinity? \",\" Who is it who rules the spirit sacrifice in many; and at the time of death how may those who have learned self-control come to the knowledge of You? \",\" The Lord Shri Krishna replied: The Supreme Spirit is the Highest Imperishable Self, and Its Nature is spiritual consciousness. The worlds have been created and are supported by an emanation from the Spirit which is called the Law. \",\" Matter consists of the forms that perish; Divinity is the Supreme Self; and He who inspires the spirit of sacrifice in man, O noblest of your race, is I Myself, Who now stand in human form before you. \",\" Whosoever at the time of death thinks only of Me, and thinking thus leaves the body and goes forth, assuredly he will know Me. \",\" On whatever sphere of being the mind of a man may be intent at the time of death, towards that place he will go. \",\" Therefore meditate always on Me, and fight; if your mind and your reason be fixed on Me, to Me shall you surely come. \",\" He whose mind does not wander, and who is engaged in constant meditation, attains the Supreme Spirit. \",\" Whoso meditates on the Omniscient, the Ancient, more minute than the atom, yet the Ruler and Upholder of all, Unimaginable, Brilliant like the Sun, Beyond the reach of darkness; \",\" He who leaves the body with mind unmoved and filled with devotion, by the power of his meditation gathering between his eyebrows his whole vital energy, attains the Supreme. \",\" Now I will speak briefly of the imperishable goal, proclaimed by those versed in the scriptures, which the mystic attains when free from passion, and for which he is content to undergo the vow of continence. \",\" Closing the gates of the body, drawing the forces of his mind into the heart and by the power of meditation concentrating his vital energy in the brain; \",\" Repeating Om, the Symbol of Eternity, holding Me always in remembrance, he who thus leaves his body and goes forth reaches the Spirit Supreme. \",\" To him who thinks constantly of Me, and of nothing else, to such an ever-faithful devotee, O Arjuna, am I ever accessible. \",\" Coming thus unto Me, these great souls go no more to the misery and death of earthly life, for they have gained perfection. \",\" The worlds, with the whole realm of creation, come and go; but, O Arjuna, whoso comes to Me, for him there is nor rebirth. \",\" Those who understand the cosmic day and cosmic night know that one day of creation is a thousand cycles, and that the night is of equal length. \",\" At the dawning of that day all objects in manifestation stream forth from the Unmanifest, and when evening falls they are dissolved into It again. \",\" The same multitude of beings, which have lived on earth so often, all are dissolved as the night of the universe approaches, to issue forth anew when morning breaks. Thus is it ordained. \",\" In truth, therefore, there is the Eternal Unmanifest, which is beyond and above the Unmanifest Spirit of Creation, which is never destroyed when all these being perish. \",\" The wise say that the Unmanifest and Indestructible is the highest goal of all; when once That is reached, there is no return. That is My Blessed Home. \",\" O Arjuna! That Highest God, in Whom all beings abide, and Who pervades the entire universe, is reached only by wholehearted devotion. \",\" Now I will tell you, O Arjuna, of the times at which, if the mystics go forth, they do not return, and at which they go forth only to return. \",\" If knowing the Supreme Spirit the sage goes forth with fire and light, in the daytime, in the fortnight of the waxing moon and in the six months before the Northern summer solstice, he will attain the Supreme. \",\" But if he departs in gloom, at night, during the fortnight of the waning moon and in the six months before the Southern solstice, then he reaches but lunar light and he will be born again. \",\" These bright and dark paths out of the world have always existed. Whoso takes the former, returns not; he who chooses the latter, returns. \",\" O Arjuna! The saint knowing these paths is not confused. Therefore meditate perpetually. \",\" The sage who knows this passes beyond all merit that comes from the study of the scriptures, from sacrifice, from austerities and charity, and reaches the Supreme Primeval Abode.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cLord Shri Krishna said: I will now reveal to you, since you doubt not, that profound mysticism, which when followed by experience, shall liberate you from sin. \",\" This is the Premier Science, the Sovereign Secret, the Purest and Best; intuitional, righteous; and to him who practises it pleasant beyond measure. \",\" They who have no faith in this teaching cannot find Me, but remain lost in the purlieus of this perishable world. \",\" The whole world is pervaded by Me, yet My form is not seen. All living things have their being in Me, yet I am not limited by them. \",\" Nevertheless, they do not consciously abide in Me. Such is My Divine Sovereignty that though I, the Supreme Self, am the cause and upholder of all, yet I remain outside. \",\" As the mighty wind, though moving everywhere, has no resting place but space, so have all these beings no home but Me. \",\" All beings, O Arjuna, return at the close of every cosmic cycle into the realm of Nature, which is a part of Me, and at the beginning of the next I send them forth again. \",\" With the help of Nature, again and again I pour forth the whole multitude of beings, whether they will or no, for they are ruled by My Will. \",\" But these acts of mine do not bind Me. I remain outside and unattached. \",\" Under my guidance, Nature produces all things movable and immovable. Thus it is, O Arjuna, that this universe revolves. \",\" Fools disregard Me, seeing Me clad in human form. They know not that in My higher nature I am the Lord-God of all. \",\" Their hopes are vain, their actions worthless, their knowledge futile; they are without sense, deceitful, barbarous and godless. \",\" But the Great Souls, O Arjuna! Filled with My Divine Spirit, they worship Me, they fix their minds on Me and on Me alone, for they know that I am the imperishable Source of being. \",\" Always extolling Me, strenuous, firm in their vows, prostrating themselves before Me, they worship Me continually with concentrated devotion. \",\" Others worship Me with full consciousness as the One, the Manifold, the Omnipresent, the Universal. \",\" I am the Oblation, the Sacrifice and the Worship; I am the Fuel and the Chant, I am the Butter offered to the fire, I am the Fire itself, and I am the Act of offering. \",\" I am the Father of the universe and its Mother; I am its Nourisher and its Grandfather; I am the Knowable and the Pure; I am Om; and I am the Sacred Scriptures. \",\" I am the Goal, the Sustainer, the Lord, the Witness, the Home, the Shelter, the Lover and the Origin; I am Life and Death; I am the Fountain and the Seed Imperishable. \",\" I am the Heat of the Sun, I release and hold back the Rains. I am Death and Immortality; I am Being and Not-Being. \",\" Those who are versed in the scriptures, who drink the mystic Soma-juice and are purified from sin, but who while worshipping Me with sacrifices pray that I will lead them to heaven; they reach the holy world where lives the Controller of the Powers of Nature, and they enjoy the feasts of Paradise. \",\" Yet although they enjoy the spacious glories of Paradise, nevertheless, when their merit is exhausted, they are born again into this world of mortals. They have followed the letter of the scriptures, yet because they have sought but to fulfill their own desires, they must depart and return again and again. \",\" But if a man will meditate on Me and Me alone, and will worship Me always and everywhere, I will take upon Myself the fulfillment of his aspiration, and I will safeguard whatsoever he shall attain. \",\" Even those who worship the lesser Powers, if they do so with faith, they thereby worship Me, though not in the right way. \",\" I am the willing recipient of sacrifice, and I am its true Lord. But these do not know me in truth, and so they sink back. \",\" The votaries of the lesser Powers go to them; the devotees of spirits go to them; they who worship the Powers of Darkness, to such Powers shall they go; and so, too, those who worship Me shall come to Me. \",\" Whatever a man offers to Me, whether it be a leaf, or a flower, of fruit, or water, I accept it, for it is offered with devotion and purity of mind. \",\" Whatever you do, whatever you do eat, whatever you do sacrifice and give, whatever austerities you practisest, do all as an offering to Me. \",\" So shall your action be attended by no result, either good or bad; but through the spirit of renunciation you shall come to Me and be free. \",\" I am the same to all beings. I favour none, and I hate none. But those who worship Me devotedly, they live in Me, and I in them. \",\" Even the most sinful, if he worship Me with his whole heart, shall be considered righteous, for he is treading the right path. \",\" He shall attain spirituality before long, and Eternal Peace shall be his. O Arjuna! Believe me, My devotee is never lost. \",\" For even the children of sinful parents, and those miscalled the weaker sex, and merchants, and labourers, if only they will make Me their refuge, they shall attain the Highest. \",\" What need then to mention the holy Ministers of God, the devotees and the saintly rulers? Do you, therefore, born in this changing and miserable world, do you too worship Me. \",\" Fix your mind on Me, devote yourself to Me, sacrifice for Me, surrender to Me, make Me the object of your aspirations, and you shall assuredly become one with Me, Who am yours own Self.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cLord Shri Krishna said: Now, O Prince! Listen to My supreme advice, which I give you for the sake of your welfare, for you are My beloved. \",\" Neither the professors of divinity nor the great ascetics know My origin, for I am the source of them all. \",\" He who knows Me as the unborn, without beginning, the Lord of the universe, he, stripped of his delusion, becomes free from all conceivable sin. \",\" Intelligence, wisdom, non-illusion, forgiveness, truth, self-control, calmness, pleasure, pain, birth, death, fear and fearlessness; \",\" Harmlessness, equanimity, contentment, austerity, beneficence, fame and failure, all these, the characteristics of beings, spring from Me only. \",\" The seven Great Seers, the Progenitors of mankind, the Ancient Four, and the Lawgivers were born of My Will and come forth direct from Me. The race of mankind has sprung from them. \",\" He who rightly understands My manifested glory and My Creative Power, beyond doubt attains perfect peace. \",\" I am the source of all; from Me everything flows. Therefore the wise worship Me with unchanging devotion. \",\" With minds concentrated on Me, with lives absorbed in Me, and enlightening each other, they ever feel content and happy. \",\" To those who are always devout and who worship Me with love, I give the power of discrimination, which leads them to Me. \",\" By My grace, I live in their hearts; and I dispel the darkness of ignorance by the shining light of wisdom. \",\" Arjuna asked: You are the Supreme Spirit, the Eternal Home, the Holiest of the Holy, the Eternal Divine Self, the Primal God, the Unborn and the Omnipresent. \",\" So have said the seers and the divine sage Narada; as well as Asita, Devala and Vyasa; and You Yourself also say it. \",\" I believe in what You have said, my Lord! For neither the godly not the godless comprehend Your manifestation. \",\" You alone know Yourself, by the power of Your Self; You the Supreme Spirit, the Source and Master of all being, the Lord of Lords, the Ruler of the Universe. \",\" Please tell me all about Your glorious manifestations, by means of which You pervade the world. \",\" O Master! How shall I, by constant meditation, know You? My Lord! What are Your various manifestations through which I am to mediate on You? \",\" Tell me again, I pray, about the fullness of Your power and Your glory; for I feel that I am never satisfied when I listen to Your immortal words. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: So be it, My beloved friend! I will unfold to you some of the chief aspects of My glory. Of its full extent there is no end. \",\" O Arjuna! I am the Self, seated in the hearts of all beings; I am the beginning and the life, and I am the end of them all. \",\" Of all the creative Powers I am the Creator, of luminaries the Sun; the Whirlwind among the winds, and the Moon among planets. \",\" Of the Vedas I am the Hymns, I am the Electric Force in the Powers of Nature; of the senses I am the Mind; and I am the Intelligence in all that lives. \",\" Among Forces of Vitality I am the life, I am Mammon to the heathen and the godless; I am the Energy in fire, earth, wind, sky, heaven, sun, moon and planets; and among mountains I am the Mount Meru. \",\" Among the priests, know, O Arjuna, that I am the Apostle Brihaspati; of generals I am Skanda, the Commander-in-Chief, and of waters I am the Ocean. \",\" Of the great seers I am Bhrigu, of words I am Om, of offerings I am the silent prayer, among things immovable I am the Himalayas. \",\" Of trees I am the sacred Fig-tree, of the Divine Seers Narada, of the heavenly singers I am Chitraratha, their Leader, and of sages I am Kapila. \",\" Know that among horses I am Pegasus, the heaven-born; among the lordly elephants I am the White one, and I am the Ruler among men. \",\" I am the Thunderbolt among weapons; of cows I am the Cow of Plenty, I am Passion in those who procreate, and I am the Cobra among serpents. \",\" I am the King-python among snakes, I am the Aqueous Principle among those that live in water, I am the Father of fathers, and among rulers I am Death. \",\" And I am the devotee Prahlad among the heathen; of Time I am the Eternal Present; I am the Lion among beasts and the Eagle among birds. \",\" I am the Wind among purifiers, the King Rama among warriors; I am the Crocodile among the fishes, and I am the Ganges among rivers. \",\" I am the Beginning, the Middle and the End in creation; among sciences, I am the science of Spirituality; I am the Discussion among disputants. \",\" Of letters I am A; I am the copulative in compound words; I am Time inexhaustible; and I am the all-pervading Preserver. \",\" I am all-devouring Death; I am the Origin of all that shall happen; I am Fame, Fortune, Speech, Memory, Intellect, Constancy and Forgiveness. \",\" Of hymns I am Brihatsama, of metres I am Garatri, among the months I am Margasheersha (December), and I am the Spring among seasons. \",\" I am the Gambling of the cheat and the Splendour of the splendid; I am Victory; I am Effort; and I am the Purity of the pure. \",\" I am Shri Krishna among the Vishnu-clan and Arjuna among the Pandavas; of the saints I am Vyasa, and I am Shukracharya among the sages. \",\" I am the Sceptre of rulers, the Strategy of the conquerors, the Silence of mystery, the Wisdom of the wise. \",\" I am the Seed of all being, O Arjuna! No creature moving or unmoving can live without Me. \",\" O Arjuna! The aspects of My divine life are endless. I have mentioned but a few by way of illustration. \",\" Whatever is glorious, excellent, beautiful and mighty, be assured that it comes from a fragment of My splendour. \",\" But what is the use of all these details to you? O Arjuna! I sustain this universe with only small part of Myself.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cArjuna said: My Lord! Your words concerning the Supreme Secret of Self, given for my blessing, have dispelled the illusions which surrounded me. \",\" O Lord, whose eyes are like the lotus petal! You have described in detail the origin and the dissolution of being, and Yours own Eternal Majesty. \",\" I believe all as You have declared it. I long now to have a vision of your Divine Form, O You Most High! \",\" If You think that it can be made possible for me to see it, show me, O Lord of Lords, Yours own Eternal Self. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: Behold, O Arjuna! My celestial forms, by hundred and thousands, various in kind, in colour and in shape. \",\" Behold you the Powers of Nature: fire, earth, wind and sky; the sun, the heavens, the moon, the stars; all forces of vitality and of healing; and the roving winds. See the myriad wonders revealed to none but you. \",\" Here in Me living as one, O Arjuna, behold the whole universe, movable and immovable, and anything else that you would see! \",\" Yet since with mortal eyes you can not see Me, lo! I give you the Divine Sight. See now the glory of My Sovereignty.\\u201d \",\" Sanjaya continued: \\u201cHaving thus spoken, O King, the Lord Shri Krishna, the Almighty Prince of Wisdom, showed to Arjuna the Supreme Form of the Great God. \",\" There were countless eyes and mouths, and mystic forms innumerable, with shining ornaments and flaming celestial weapons. \",\" Crowned with heavenly garlands, clothed in shining garments, anointed with divine unctions, He showed Himself as the Resplendent One, Marvellous, Boundless, Omnipresent. \",\" Could a thousand suns blaze forth together it would be but a faint reflection of the radiance of the Lord God. \",\" In that vision Arjuna saw the universe, with its manifold shapes, all embraced in One, its Supreme Lord. \",\" Thereupon Arjuna, dumb with awe, his hair on end, his head bowed, his hands clasped in salutation, addressed the Lord thus: \",\" Arjuna said: O almighty God! I see in You the powers of Nature, the various creatures of the world, the Progenitor on his lotus throne, the Sages and the shining angels. \",\" I see You, infinite in form, with, as it were, faces, eyes and limbs everywhere; no beginning, no middle, no end; O You Lord of the Universe, Whose Form is universal! \",\" I see you with the crown, the sceptre and the discus; a blaze of splendour. Scarce can I gaze on you, so radiant you are, glowing like the blazing fire, brilliant as the sun, immeasurable. \",\" Imperishable are You, the Sole One worthy to be known, the priceless Treasure-house of the universe, the immortal Guardian of the Life Eternal, the Spirit Everlasting. \",\" Without beginning, without middle and without end, infinite in power, Yours arms allembracing, the sun and moon Yours eyes, Your face beaming with the fire of sacrifice, flooding the whole universe with light. \",\" Alone you fill all the quarters of the sky, earth and heaven, and the regions between. O Almighty Lord! Seeing Your marvellous and awe-inspiring Form, the spheres tremble with fear. \",\" The troops of celestial beings enter into You, some invoking You in fear, with folded palms; the Great Seers and Adepts sing hymns to Your Glory, saying `All Hail.\\u2019 \",\" The Vital Forces, the Major stars, Fire, Earth, Air, Sky, Sun, Heaven, Moon and Planets; the Angels, the Guardians of the Universe, the divine Healers, the Winds, the Fathers, the Heavenly Singers; and hosts of Mammon-worshippers, demons as well as saints, are amazed. \",\" Seeing Your stupendous Form, O Most Mighty, with its myriad faces, its innumerable eyes and limbs and terrible jaws, I myself and all the worlds are overwhelmed with awe. \",\" When I see You, touching the Heavens, glowing with colour, with open mouth and wide open fiery eyes, I am terrified. O My Lord! My courage and peace of mind desert me. \",\" When I see Your mouths with their fearful jaws like glowing fires at the dissolution of creation, I lose all sense of place; I find no rest. Be merciful, O Lord in whom this universe abides! \",\" All these sons of Dhritarashtra, with the hosts of princes, Bheeshma, Drona and Karna, as well as the other warrior chiefs belonging to our side; \",\" I see them all rushing headlong into Your mouths, with terrible tusks, horrible to behold. Some are mangled between your jaws, with their heads crushed to atoms. \",\" As rivers in flood surge furiously to the ocean, so these heroes, the greatest among men, fling themselves into Your flaming mouths. \",\" As moths fly impetuously to the flame only to be killed, so these men rush into Your mouths to court their own destruction. \",\" You seem to swallow up the worlds, to lap them in flame. Your glory fills the universe. Your fierce rays beat down upon it irresistibly. \",\" Tell me then who You are, that wear this dreadful Form? I bow before You, O Mighty One! Have mercy, I pray, and let me see You as You were at first. I do not know what You intend. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: I have shown myself to you as the Destroyer who lays waste the world and whose purpose is destruction. In spite of your efforts, all these warriors gathered for battle shall not escape death. \",\" Then gird up your loins and conquer. Subdue your foes and enjoy the kingdom in prosperity. I have already doomed them. Be you my instrument, Arjuna! \",\" Drona and Bheeshma, Jayadratha and Karna, and other brave warriors \\u2013 I have condemned them all. Destroy them; fight and fear not. Your foes shall be crushed.\\u201d \",\" Sanjaya continued: \\u201cHaving heard these words from the Lord Shri Krishna, the Prince Arjuna, with folded hands trembling, prostrated himself and with choking voice, bowing down again and again, and overwhelmed with awe, once more addressed the Lord. \",\" Arjuna said: My Lord! It is natural that the world revels and rejoices when it sings the praises of Your glory; the demons fly in fear and the saints offer You their salutations. \",\" How should they do otherwise? O You Most Supreme Self, greater than the Powers of creation, the First Cause, Infinite, the Lord of Lords, the Home of the universe, Imperishable, Being and Not-Being, yet transcending both. \",\" You are the Primal God, the Ancient, the Supreme Abode of this universe, the Knower, the Knowledge and the Final Home. You fill everything. Your form is infinite. \",\" You are the Wind, You are Death, You are the Fire, the Water, the Moon, the Father and the Grandfather. Honour and glory to You a thousand and a thousand times! Again and again, salutation be to You, O my Lord! \",\" Salutations to You in front and on every side, You who encompasseth me round about. Your power is infinite; Your majesty immeasurable; you uphold all things; yea,Thou Yourself are All. \",\" Whatever I have said unto You in rashness, taking You only for a friend and addressing You as `O Krishna! O Yadava! O Friend!\\u2019 in thoughtless familiarity, no understanding Your greatness; \",\" Whatever insult I have offered to You in jest, in sport or in repose, in conversation or at the banquet, alone or in a multitude, I ask Your forgiveness for them all, O You Who are without an equal! \",\" For You are the Father of all things movable and immovable, the Worshipful, the Master of Masters! In all the worlds there is none equal to You, how then superior, O You who stand alone, Supreme. \",\" Therefore I prostrate myself before You, O Lord! Most Adorable! I salute You, I ask Your blessing. Only You can be trusted to bear with me, as father to son, as friend to friend, as lover to his beloved. \",\" I rejoice that I have seen what never man saw before; yet, O Lord! I am overwhelmed with fear. Please take again the Form I know. Be merciful, O Lord! you Who are the Home of the whole universe. \",\" I long to see You as you were before, with the crown, the sceptre and the discus in Your hands; in Your other Form, with Your four hands, O You Whose arms are countless and Whose forms are infinite. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: My beloved friend! It is only through My grace and power that you have been able to see this vision of splendour, the Universal, the Infinite, the Original. Never has it been seen by any but you. \",\" Not by study of the scriptures, not by sacrifice or gift, not by ritual or rigorous austerity, is it possible for man on earth to see what you have seen, O you foremost hero of the Kuruclan! \",\" Be not afraid or bewildered by the terrible vision. Put away your fear and, with joyful mind, see Me once again in My usual Form.\\u201d \",\" Sanjaya continued: \\u201cHaving thus spoken to Arjuna, Lord Shri Krishna showed Himself again in His accustomed form; and the Mighty Lord, in gentle tones, softly consoled him who lately trembled with fear. \",\" Arjuna said: Seeing You in Your gentle human form, my Lord, I am myself again, calm once more. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: It is hard to see this vision of Me that you have seen. Even the most powerful have longed for it in vain. \",\" Not by study of the scriptures, or by austerities, not by gifts or sacrifices, is it possible to see Me as you have done. \",\" Only by tireless devotion can I be seen and known; only thus can a man become one with Me, O Arjuna! \",\" He whose every action is done for My sake, to whom I am the final goal, who loves Me only and hates no one \\u2013 O My dearest son, only he can realize Me!\\u201d \",\"\\u201cArjuna asked: My Lord! Which are the better devotees who worship You, those who try to know You as a Personal God, or those who worship You as Impersonal and Indestructible? \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: Those who keep their minds fixed on Me, who worship Me always with unwavering faith and concentration; these are the very best. \",\" Those who worship Me as the Indestructible, the Undefinable, the Omnipresent, the Unthinkable, the Primeval, the Immutable and the Eternal; \",\" Subduing their senses, viewing all conditions of life with the same eye, and working for the welfare of all beings, assuredly they come to Me. \",\" But they who thus fix their attention on the Absolute and Impersonal encounter greater hardships, for it is difficult for those who possess a body to realise Me as without one. \",\" Verily, those who surrender their actions to Me, who muse on Me, worship Me and meditate on Me alone, with no thought save of Me, \",\" O Arjuna! I rescue them from the ocean of life and death, for their minds are fixed on Me. \",\" Then let your mind cling only to Me, let your intellect abide in Me; and without doubt you shall live hereafter in Me alone. \",\" But if you can not fix your mind firmly on Me, then, My beloved friend, try to do so by constant practice. \",\" And if you are not strong enough to practise concentration, then devote yourself to My service, do all yours acts for My sake, and you shall still attain the goal. \",\" And if you are too weak even for this, then seek refuge in union with Me, and with perfect self-control renounce the fruit of your action. \",\" Knowledge is superior to blind action, meditation to mere knowledge, renunciation of the fruit of action to meditation, and where there is renunciation peace will follow. \",\" He who is incapable of hatred towards any being, who is kind and compassionate, free from selfishness, without pride, equable in pleasure and in pain, and forgiving, \",\" Always contented, self-centred, self-controlled, resolute, with mind and reason dedicated to Me, such a devotee of Mine is My beloved. \",\" He who does not harm the world, and whom the world cannot harm, who is not carried away by any impulse of joy, anger or fear, such a one is My beloved. \",\" He who expects nothing, who is pure, watchful, indifferent, unruffled, and who renounces all initiative, such a one is My beloved. \",\" He who is beyond joy and hate, who neither laments nor desires, to whom good and evil fortunes are the same, such a one is My beloved. \",\" He to whom friend and foe are alike, who welcomes equally honour and dishonour, heat and cold, pleasure and pain, who is enamoured of nothing, \",\" Who is indifferent to praise and censure, who enjoys silence, who is contented with every fate, who has no fixed abode, who is steadfast in mind, and filled with devotion, such a one is My beloved. \",\" Verily those who love the spiritual wisdom as I have taught, whose faith never fails, and who concentrate their whole nature on Me, they indeed are My most beloved.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cArjuna asked: My Lord! Who is God and what is Nature; what is Matter and what is the Self; what is that they call Wisdom, and what is it that is worth knowing? I wish to have this explained. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: O Arjuna! The body of man is the playground of the Self; and That which knows the activities of Matter, sages call the Self. \",\" I am the Omniscient self that abides in the playground of Matter; knowledge of Matter and of the all-knowing Self is wisdom. \",\" What is called Matter, of what it is composed, where it came, and why it changes, what the Self is, and what Its power \\u2013 this I will now briefly set forth. \",\" Seers have sung of It in various ways, in many hymns and sacred Vedic songs, weighty in thought and convincing in argument. \",\" The five great fundamentals (earth, fire, air, water and ether), personality, intellect, the mysterious life force, the ten organs of perception and action, the mind and the five domains of sensation; \",\" Desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, sympathy, vitality and the persistent clinging to life, these are in brief the constituents of changing Matter. \",\" Humility, sincerity, harmlessness, forgiveness, rectitude, service of the Master, purity, steadfastness, self-control; \",\" Renunciation of the delights of sense, absence of pride, right understanding of the painful problem of birth and death, of age and sickness; \",\" Indifference, non-attachment to sex, progeny or home, equanimity in good fortune and in bad; \",\" Unswerving devotion to Me, by concentration on Me and Me alone, a love for solitude, indifference to social life; \",\" Constant yearning for the knowledge of Self, and pondering over the lessons of the great Truth \\u2013 this is Wisdom, all else ignorance. \",\" I will speak to you now of that great Truth which man ought to know, since by its means he will win immortal bliss \\u2013 that which is without beginning, the Eternal Spirit which dwells in Me, neither with form, nor yet without it. \",\" Everywhere are Its hands and Its feet; everywhere It has eyes that see, heads that think and mouths that speak; everywhere It listens; It dwells in all the worlds; It envelops them all. \",\" Beyond the senses, It yet shines through every sense perception. Bound to nothing, It yet sustains everything. Unaffected by the Qualities, It still enjoys them all. \",\" It is within all beings, yet outside; motionless yet moving; too subtle to be perceived; far away yet always near. \",\" In all beings undivided, yet living in division, It is the upholder of all, Creator and Destroyer alike; \",\" It is the Light of lights, beyond the reach of darkness; the Wisdom, the only thing that is worth knowing or that wisdom can teach; the Presence in the hearts of all. \",\" Thus I have told you in brief what Matter is, and the Self worth realising and what is Wisdom. He who is devoted to Me knows; and assuredly he will enter into Me. \",\" Know you further that Nature and God have no beginning; and that differences of character and quality have their origin in Nature only. \",\" Nature is the Law which generates cause and effect; God is the source of the enjoyment of all pleasure and pain. \",\" God dwelling in the heart of Nature experiences the Qualities which nature brings forth; and His affinity towards the Qualities is the reason for His living in a good or evil body. \",\" Thus in the body of man dwells the Supreme God; He who sees and permits, upholds and enjoys, the Highest God and the Highest Self. \",\" He who understands God and Nature along with her qualities, whatever be his condition in life, he comes not again to earth. \",\" Some realise the Supreme by meditating, by its aid, on the Self within, others by pure reason, others by right action. \",\" Others again, having no direct knowledge but only hearing from others, nevertheless worship, and they, too, if true to the teachings, cross the sea of death. \",\" Wherever life is seen in things movable or immovable, it is the joint product of Matter and Spirit. \",\" He who can see the Supreme Lord in all beings, the Imperishable amidst the perishable, he it is who really sees. \",\" Beholding the Lord in all things equally, his actions do not mar his spiritual life but lead him to the height of Bliss. \",\" He who understands that it is only the Law of Nature that brings action to fruition, and that the Self never acts, alone knows the Truth. \",\" He who sees the diverse forms of life all rooted in One, and growing forth from Him, he shall indeed find the Absolute. \",\" The Supreme Spirit, O Prince, is without beginning, without Qualities and Imperishable, and though it be within the body, yet It does not act, nor is It affected by action. \",\" As space, though present everywhere, remains by reason of its subtlety unaffected, so the Self, though present in all forms, retains its purity unalloyed. \",\" As the one Sun illuminates the whole earth, so the Lord illumines the whole universe. \",\" Those who with the eyes of wisdom thus see the difference between Matter and Spirit, and know how to liberate Life from the Law of Nature, they attain the Supreme.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cLord Shri Krishna continued: Now I will reveal unto the Wisdom which is beyond knowledge, by attaining which the sages have reached Perfection. \",\" Dwelling in Wisdom and realising My Divinity, they are not born again when the universe is re-created at the beginning of every cycle, nor are they affected when it is dissolved. \",\" The eternal Cosmos is My womb, in which I plant the seed, from which all beings are born, O Prince! \",\" O illustrious son of Kunti! Through whatever wombs men are born, it is the Spirit Itself that conceives, and I am their Father. \",\" Purity, Passion and Ignorance are the Qualities which the Law of nature brings forth. They fetter the free Spirit in all beings. \",\" O Sinless One! Of these, Purity, being luminous, strong and invulnerable, binds one by its yearning for happiness and illumination. \",\" Passion, engendered by thirst for pleasure and attachment, binds the soul through its fondness for activity. \",\" But Ignorance, the product of darkness, stupefies the senses in all embodied beings, binding them by chains of folly, indolence and lethargy. \",\" Purity brings happiness, Passion commotion, and Ignorance, which obscures wisdom, leads to a life of failure. \",\" O Prince! Purity prevails when Passion and Ignorance are overcome; Passion, when Purity and Ignorance are overcome; and Ignorance when it overcomes Purity and Passion. \",\" When the light of knowledge gleams forth from all the gates of the body, then be sure that Purity prevails. \",\" O best of Indians! Avarice, the impulse to act and the beginning of action itself are all due to the dominance of Passion. \",\" Darkness, stagnation, folly and infatuation are the result of the dominance of Ignorance, O joy of the Kuru-clan! \",\" When Purity prevails, the soul on quitting the body passes on to the pure regions where live those who know the Highest. \",\" When Passion prevails, the soul is reborn among those who love activity; when Ignorance rules, it enters the wombs of the ignorant. \",\" They say the fruit of a meritorious action is spotless and full of purity; the outcome of Passion is misery, and of Ignorance darkness. \",\" Purity engenders Wisdom, Passion avarice, and Ignorance folly, infatuation and darkness. \",\" When Purity is in the ascendant, the man evolves; when Passion, he neither evolves nor degenerates; when Ignorance, he is lost. \",\" As soon as man understands that it is only the Qualities which act and nothing else, and perceives That which is beyond, he attains My divine nature. \",\" When the soul transcends the Qualities, which are the real cause of physical existence, then, freed from birth and death, from old age and misery, he quaffs the nectar of immortality. \",\" Arjuna asked: My Lord! By what signs can he who has transcended the Qualities be recognized? How does he act? How does he live beyond them? \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: O Prince! He who shuns not the Quality which is present, and longs not for that which is absent; \",\" He who maintains an attitude of indifference, who is not disturbed by the Qualities, who realises that it is only they who act, and remains calm; \",\" Who accepts pain and pleasure as it comes, is centred in his Self, to whom a piece of clay or stone or gold are the same, who neither likes nor dislikes, who is steadfast, indifferent alike to praise or censure; \",\" Who looks equally upon honour and dishonour, loves friends and foes alike, abandons all initiative, such is he who transcends the Qualities. \",\" And he who serves Me and only Me, with unfaltering devotion, shall overcome the Qualities, and become One with the Eternal. \",\" For I am the Home of the Spirit, the continual Source of immortality, of eternal Righteousness and of infinite Joy.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cLord Shri Krishna continued: This phenomenal creation, which is both ephemeral and eternal, is like a tree, but having its seed above in the Highest and its ramifications on this earth below. The scriptures are its leaves, and he who understands this, knows. \",\" Its branches shoot upwards and downwards, deriving their nourishment from the Qualities; its buds are the objects of sense; and its roots, which follow the Law causing man\\u2019s regeneration and degeneration, pierce downwards into the soil. \",\" In this world its true form is not known, neither its origin nor its end, and its strength is not understood., until the tree with its roots striking deep into the earth is hewn down by the sharp axe of non-attachment. \",\" Beyond lies the Path, from which, when found, there is no return. This is the Primal God from where this ancient creation has sprung. \",\" The wise attain Eternity when, freed from pride and delusion, they have conquered their love for the things of sense; when, renouncing desire and fixing their gaze on the Self, they have ceased to be tossed to and fro by the opposing sensations, like pleasure and pain. \",\" Neither sun, moon, nor fire shines there. Those who go towards that place never come back. For, O Arjuna, that is my Celestial Home! \",\" It is only a very small part of My Eternal Self, which is the life of the universe, drawing round itself the six senses, the mind the last, which have their source in Nature. \",\" When the Supreme Lord enters a body or leaves it, He gathers these senses together and travels on with them, as the wind gathers perfume while passing through the flowers. \",\" He is the perception of the ear, the eye, the touch, the taste and the smell, yea and of the mind also; and the enjoyment the things which they perceive is also His. \",\" The ignorant do not see that it is He Who is present in life and Who departs at death or even that it is He Who enjoys pleasure through the Qualities. Only the eye of wisdom sees. \",\" The saints with great effort find Him within themselves; but not the unintelligent, who in spite of every effort cannot control their minds. \",\" Remember that the Light which, proceeding from the sun, illumines the whole world, and the Light which is in the moon, and That which is in the fire also, all are born of Me. \",\" I enter this world and animate all My creatures with My vitality; and by My cool moonbeams I nourish the plants. \",\" Becoming the fire of life, I pass into their bodies and, uniting with the vital streams of Prana and Apana, I digest the various kinds of food. \",\" I am enthroned in the hearts of all; memory, wisdom and discrimination owe their origins to Me. I am He Who is to be realised in the scriptures; I inspire their wisdom and I know their truth. \",\" There are two aspects in Nature: the perishable and the imperishable. All life in this world belongs to the former, the unchanging element belongs to the latter. \",\" But higher than all am I, the Supreme God, the Absolute Self, the Eternal Lord, Who pervades the worlds and upholds them all. \",\" Beyond comparison of the Eternal with the non-eternal am I, Who am called by scriptures and sages the Supreme Personality, the Highest God. \",\" He who with unclouded vision sees Me as the Lord-God, knows all there is to be known, and always shall worship Me with his whole heart. \",\" Thus, O Sinless One, I have revealed to you this most mystic knowledge. He who understands gains wisdom and attains the consummation of life.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cLord Shri Krishna continued: Fearlessness, clean living, unceasing concentration on wisdom, readiness to give, self-control, a spirit of sacrifice, regular study of the scriptures, austerities, candour, \",\" harmlessness, truth, absence of wrath, renunciation, contentment, straightforwardness, compassion towards all, uncovetousness, courtesy, modesty, constancy, \",\" Valour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, freedom from hate and vanity; these are his who possesses the Godly Qualities, O Arjuna! \",\" Hypocrisy, pride, insolence, cruelty, ignorance belong to him who is born of the godless qualities. \",\" Godly qualities lead to liberation; godless to bondage. Do not be anxious, Prince! You have the Godly qualities. \",\" All beings are of two classes: Godly and godless. The Godly I have described; I will now describe the other. \",\" The godless do not know how to act or how to renounce. They have neither purity nor truth. They do not understand the right principles of conduct. \",\" They say the universe is an accident with no purpose and no God. Life is created by sexual union, a product of lust and nothing else. \",\" Thinking thus, these degraded souls, these enemies of mankind \\u2013 whose intelligence is negligible and whose deeds are monstrous \\u2013 come into the world only to destroy. \",\" Giving themselves up to insatiable passions, hypocritical, self-sufficient and arrogant, cherishing false conception founded on delusion, they work only to carry out their own unholy purposes. \",\" Poring anxiously over evil resolutions, which only end in death; seeking only the gratification of desire as the highest goal; seeing nothing beyond; \",\" Caught in the toils of a hundred vain hopes, the slaves of passion and wrath, they accumulate hoards of unjust wealth, only to pander to their sensual desire. \",\" This I have gained today; tomorrow I will gratify another desire; this wealth is mine now, the rest shall be mine before long; \",\" I have slain one enemy, I will slay the others also; I am worthy to enjoy, I am the Almighty, I am perfect, powerful and happy; \",\" I am rich, I am well-bred; who is there to compare with me? I will sacrifice, I will give, I will pay \\u2013 and I will enjoy. Thus blinded by Ignorance, \",\" Perplexed by discordant thoughts, entangled in the snares of desire, infatuated by passion, they sink into the horrors of hell. \",\" Self-conceited, stubborn, rich, proud and insolent, they make a display of their patronage, disregarding the rules of decency. \",\" Puffed up by power and inordinate conceit, swayed by lust and wrath, these wicked people hate Me Who am within them, as I am within all. \",\" Those who thus hate Me, who are cruel, the dregs of mankind, I condemn them to a continuous, miserable and godless rebirth. \",\" So reborn, they spend life after life, enveloped in delusion. And they never reach Me, O Prince, but degenerate into still lower forms of life. \",\" The gates of hell are three: lust, wrath and avarice. They destroy the Self. Avoid them. \",\" These are the gates which lead to darkness; if a man avoid them he will ensure his own welfare, and in the end will attain his liberation. \",\" But he who neglects the commands of the scriptures, and follows the promptings of passion, he does not attain perfection, happiness or the final goal. \",\" Therefore whenever there is doubt whether you should do a thing or not, let the scriptures guide your conduct. In the light of the scriptures should you labour the whole of your life.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cArjuna asked: My Lord! Those who do acts of sacrifice, not according to the scriptures but nevertheless with implicit faith, what is their condition? Is it one of Purity, of Passion or of Ignorance? \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: Man has an inherent faith in one or another of the Qualities \\u2013 Purity, Passion and Ignorance. Now listen. \",\" The faith of every man conforms to his nature. By nature he is full of faith. He is in fact what his faith makes him. \",\" The Pure worship the true God; the Passionate, the powers of wealth and magic; the Ignorant, the spirits of the dead and of the lower orders of nature. \",\" Those who practise austerities not commanded by scripture, who are slaves to hypocrisy and egotism, who are carried away by the fury of desire and passion, \",\" They are ignorant. They torment the organs of the body; and they harass Me also, Who lives within. Know that they are devoted to evil. \",\" The food which men enjoy is also threefold, like the ways of sacrifice, austerity and almsgiving. Listen to the distinction. \",\" The foods that prolong life and increase purity, vigour, health, cheerfulness and happiness are those that are delicious, soothing, substantial and agreeable. These are loved by the Pure. \",\" Those in whom Passion is dominant like foods that are bitter, sour, salty, over-hot, pungent, dry and burning. These produce unhappiness, repentance and disease. \",\" The Ignorant love food which is stale, not nourishing, putrid and corrupt, the leavings of others and unclean. \",\" Sacrifice is Pure when it is offered by one who does not covet the fruit thereof, when it is done according to the commands of scripture, and with implicit faith that the sacrifice is a duty. \",\" Sacrifice which is performed for the sake of its results, or for self-glorification \\u2013 that, O best of Aryans, is the product of Passion. \",\" Sacrifice that is contrary to scriptural command, that is unaccompanied by prayers or gifts of food or money, and is without faith \\u2013 that is the product of Ignorance. \",\" Worship of God and the Master; respect for the preacher and the philosopher; purity, rectitude, continence and harmlessness \\u2013 all this is physical austerity. \",\" Speech that hurts no one, that is true, is pleasant to listen to and beneficial, and the constant study of the scriptures \\u2013 this is austerity in speech. \",\" Serenity, kindness, silence, self-control and purity \\u2013 this is austerity of mind. \",\" These threefold austerities performed with faith, and without thought of reward, may truly be accounted Pure. \",\" Austerity coupled with hypocrisy or performed for the sake of self-glorification, popularity or vanity, comes from Passion, and its result is always doubtful and temporary. \",\" Austerity done under delusion, and accompanied with sorcery or torture to oneself or another, may be assumed to spring from Ignorance. \",\" The gift which is given without thought of recompense, in the belief that it ought to be made, in a fit place, at an opportune time and to a deserving person \\u2013 such a gift is Pure. \",\" That which is given for the sake of the results it will produce, or with the hope of recompense,or grudgingly \\u2013 that may truly be said to be the outcome of Passion. \",\" And that which is given at an unsuitable place or time or to one who is unworthy, or with disrespect or contempt \\u2013 such a gift is the result of Ignorance. \",\" `Om Tat Sat\\u2019 is the triple designation of the Eternal Spirit, by which of old the Vedic Scriptures, the ceremonials and the sacrifices were ordained. \",\" Therefore all acts of sacrifice, gifts and austerities, prescribed by the scriptures, are always begun by those who understand the Spirit with the word Om. \",\" Those who desire deliverance begin their acts of sacrifice, austerity or gift with the word `Tat\\u2019 (meaning `That\\u2019), without thought of reward. \",\" `Sat\\u2019 means Reality or the highest Good, and also, O Arjuna, it is used to mean an action of exceptional merit. \",\" Conviction in sacrifice, in austerity and in giving is also called `Sat.\\u2019 So too an action done only for the Lord\\u2019s sake. \",\" Whatsoever is done without faith, whether it be sacrifice, austerity or gift or anything else, as called `Asat\\u2019 (meaning `Unreal\\u2019) for it is the negation of `Sat,\\u2019 O Arjuna! Such an act has no significance, here or hereafter.\\u201d \",\"\\u201cArjuna asked: O mighty One! I desire to know how relinquishment is distinguished from renunciation. \",\" Lord Shri Krishna replied: The sages say that renunciation means forgoing an action which springs from desire; and relinquishing means the surrender of its fruit. \",\" Some philosophers say that all action is evil and should be abandoned. Others that acts of sacrifice, benevolence and austerity should not be given up. \",\" O best of Indians! Listen to my judgment as regards this problem. It has a threefold aspect. Acts of sacrifice, benevolence and austerity should not be given up but should be performed, for they purify the aspiring soul. \",\" But they should be done with detachment and without thought of recompense. This is my final judgment. \",\" It is not right to give up actions which are obligatory; and if they are misunderstood, it is the result of sheer ignorance. \",\" To avoid an action through fear of physical suffering, because it is likely to be painful, is to act from passion, and the benefit of renunciation will not follow. \",\" He who performs an obligatory action, because he believes it to be a duty which ought to be done, without any personal desire to do the act or to receive any return \\u2013 such renunciation is Pure. \",\" The wise man who has attained purity, whose doubts are solved, who is filled with the spirit of self-abnegation, does not shrink from action because it brings pain, nor does he desire it because it brings pleasure. \",\" But since those still in the body cannot entirely avoid action, in their case abandonment of the fruit of action is considered as complete renunciation. \",\" For those who cannot renounce all desire, the fruit of action hereafter is threefold \\u2013 good, evil, and partly good and partly evil. But for him who has renounced, there is none. \",\" I will tell you now, O Mighty Man, the five causes which, according to the final decision of philosophy, must concur before an action can be accomplished. \",\" They are a body, a personality, physical organs, their manifold activity and destiny. \",\" Whatever action a man performs, whether by muscular effort or by speech or by thought, and whether it be right or wrong, these five are the essential causes. \",\" But the fool who supposes, because of his immature judgment, that it is his own Self alone that acts, he perverts the truth and does not see rightly. \",\" He who has no pride, and whose intellect is unalloyed by attachment, even though he kill these people, yet he does not kill them, and his act does not bind him. \",\" Knowledge, the knower and the object of knowledge, these are the three incentives to action; and the act, the actor and the instrument are the threefold constituents. \",\" The knowledge, the act and the doer differ according to the Qualities. Listen to this too: \",\" That knowledge which sees the One Indestructible in all beings, the One Indivisible in all separate lives, may be truly called Pure Knowledge. \",\" The knowledge which thinks of the manifold existence in all beings as separate \\u2013 that comes from Passion. \",\" But that which clings blindly to one idea as if it were all, without logic, truth or insight, that has its origin in Darkness. \",\" An obligatory action done by one who is disinterested, who neither likes nor dislikes it, and gives no thought to the consequences that follow, such an action is Pure. \",\" But even though an action involve the most strenuous endeavour, yet if the doer is seeking to gratify his desires, and is filled with personal vanity, it may be assumed to originate in Passion. \",\" An action undertaken through delusion, and with no regard to the spiritual issues involved, or the real capacity of the doer, or to the injury which may follow, such an act may be assumed to be the product of Ignorance. \",\" But when a man has no sentiment and no personal vanity, when he possesses courage and confidence, cares not whether he succeeds or fails, then his action arises from Purity. \",\" In him who is impulsive, greedy, looking for reward, violent, impure, torn between joy and sorrow,it may be assumed that in him Passion is predominant. \",\" While he whose purpose is infirm, who is low-minded, stubborn, dishonest, malicious, indolent, despondent, procrastinating \\u2013 he may be assumed to be in Darkness. \",\" Reason and conviction are threefold, according to the Quality which is dominant. I will explain them fully and severally, O Arjuna! \",\" That intellect which understands the creation and dissolution of life, what actions should be done and what not, which discriminates between fear and fearlessness, bondage and deliverance, that is Pure. \",\" The intellect which does not understand what is right and what is wrong, and what should be done and what not, is under the sway of Passion. \",\" And that which, shrouded in Ignorance, thinks wrong right, and sees everything perversely, O Arjuna, that intellect is ruled by Darkness. \",\" The conviction and steady concentration by which the mind, the vitality and the senses are controlled \\u2013 O Arjuna! They are the product of Purity. \",\" The conviction which always holds fast to rituals, to self-interest and wealth, for the sake of what they may bring forth \\u2013 that comes from Passion. \",\" And that which clings perversely to false idealism, fear, grief, despair and vanity is the product of Ignorance. \",\" Hear further the three kinds of pleasure. That which increases day after day delivers one from misery, \",\" Which at first seems like poison but afterwards acts like nectar \\u2013 that pleasure is Pure, for it is born of Wisdom. \",\" That which as first is like nectar, because the senses revel in their objects, but in the end acts like poison \\u2013 that pleasure arises from Passion. \",\" While the pleasure which from first to last merely drugs the senses, which springs from indolence, lethargy and folly \\u2013 that pleasure flows from Ignorance. \",\" There is nothing anywhere on earth or in the higher worlds which is free from the three Qualities \\u2013 for they are born of Nature. \",\" O Arjuna! The duties of spiritual teachers, the soldiers, the traders and the servants have all been fixed according to the dominant Quality in their nature. \",\" Serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity, forgiveness, as well as uprightness, knowledge, wisdom and faith in God \\u2013 these constitute the duty of a spiritual Teacher. \",\" Valour, glory, firmness, skill, generosity, steadiness in battle and ability to rule \\u2013 these constitute the duty of a soldier. They flow from his own nature. \",\" Agriculture, protection of the cow and trade are the duty of a trader, again in accordance with his nature. The duty of a servant is to serve, and that too agrees with his nature. \",\" Perfection is attained when each attends diligently to his duty. Listen and I will tell you how it is attained by him who always minds his own duty. \",\" Man reaches perfection by dedicating his actions to God, Who is the source of all being, and fills everything. \",\" It is better to do one\\u2019s own duty, however defective it may be, than to follow the duty of another, however well one may perform it. He who does his duty as his own nature reveals it, never sins. \",\" The duty that of itself falls to one\\u2019s lot should not be abandoned, though it may have its defects. All acts are marred by defects, as fire is obscured by smoke. \",\" He whose mind is entirely detached, who has conquered himself, whose desires have vanished, by his renunciation reaches that stage of perfect freedom where action completes itself and leaves no seed. \",\" I will now state briefly how he, who has reached perfection, finds the Eternal Spirit, the state of Supreme Wisdom. \",\" Guided always by pure reason, bravely restraining himself, renouncing the objects of sense and giving up attachment and hatred; \",\" Enjoying solitude, abstemiousness, his body, mind and speech under perfect control, absorbed in meditation, he becomes free \\u2013 always filled with the spirit of renunciation. \",\" Having abandoned selfishness, power, arrogance, anger and desire, possessing nothing of his own and having attained peace, he is fit to join the Eternal Spirit. \",\" And when he becomes one with the Eternal, and his soul knows the bliss that belongs to the Self, he feels no desire and no regret, he regards all beings equally and enjoys the blessing of supreme devotion to Me. \",\" By such devotion, he sees Me, who I am and what I am; and thus realising the Truth, he enters My Kingdom. \",\" Relying on Me in all his action and doing them for My sake, he attains, by My Grace, Eternal and Unchangeable Life. \",\" Surrender then your actions unto Me, live in Me, concentrate yours intellect on Me, and think always of Me. \",\" Fix but your mind on Me, and by My grace you shall overcome the obstacles in your path. But if, misled by pride, you will not listen, then indeed you shall be lost. \",\" If you in your vanity think of avoiding this fight, your will shall not be fulfilled, for Nature herself will compel you. \",\" O Arjuna! Your duty binds you. From yours own nature has it arisen, and that which in your delusion you desire not to do, that very thing you shall do. You are helpless. \",\" God dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna! He causes them to revolve as it were on a wheel by His mystic power. \",\" With all your strength, fly unto Him and surrender yourself, and by His grace shall you attain Supreme Peace and reach the Eternal Home. \",\" Thus have I revealed to you the Truth, the Mystery of mysteries. Having thought it over, you are free to act as you will. \",\" Only listen once more to My last word, the deepest secret of all; you are My beloved, you are My friend, and I speak for your welfare. \",\" Dedicate yourself to Me, worship Me, sacrifice all for Me, prostrate yourself before Me, and to Me you shall surely come. Truly do I pledge you; you are My own beloved. \",\" Give up then your earthly duties, surrender yourself to Me only. Do not be anxious; I will absolve you from all your sin. \",\" Speak not this to one who has not practised austerities, or to him who does not love, or who will not listen, or who mocks. \",\" But he who teaches this great secret to My devotees, his is the highest devotion, and verily he shall come unto Me. \",\" Nor is there among men any who can perform a service dearer to Me than this, or any man on earth more beloved by Me than he. \",\" He who will study this spiritual discourse of ours, I assure you, he shall thereby worship Me at the altar of Wisdom. \",\" Yea, he who listens to it with faith and without doubt, even he, freed from evil, shall rise to the worlds which the virtuous attain through righteous deeds. \",\" O Arjuna! Have you listened attentively to My words? Has your ignorance and your delusion gone? \",\" Arjuna replied: My Lord! O Immutable One! My delusion has fled. By Your Grace, O Changeless One, the light has dawned. My doubts are gone, and I stand before You ready to do Your will.\\u201d \",\" Sanjaya told: \\u201cThus have I heard this rare, wonderful and soul-stirring discourse of the Lord Shri Krishna and the great-souled Arjuna. \",\" Through the blessing of the sage Vyasa, I listened to this secret and noble science from the lips of its Master, the Lord Shri Krishna. \",\" O King! The more I think of that marvellous and holy discourse, the more I lose myself in joy. \",\" As memory recalls again and again the exceeding beauty of the Lord, I am filled with amazement and happiness. \",\" Wherever is the Lord Shri Krishna, the Prince of Wisdom, and wherever is Arjuna, the Great Archer, I am more than convinced that good fortune, victory, happiness and righteousness will follow\\u201d \"],\"label\":[\"Eknath Easwaran\",\"Eknath Easwaran\",\"Eknath Easwaran\",\"Eknath Easwaran\",\"Eknath Easwaran\",\"Eknath Easwaran\",\"Eknath Easwaran\",\"Eknath
